	<text>Last Sunday, the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) screened a Haryanvi feature film about female foeticide, which was released in 2011. Now, the MCG plans to screen the film, 'Aathwan Vachan - Ek Pratigya', in every ward of Gurgaon. "We will speak to the deputy commissioner, TL Satyaprakash (who is also the MCG chief), about screening it in different parts of Gurgaon. The issue addressed in the film is in sync with the central government's Save The Girl Child campaign," says SS Rohilla, PRO, MCG. Ramniwas Sharma, a Gurgaon-based businessman who produced the film, said that thanks to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, his film is now getting the support that he sought five years back. Talking about what inspired him to make a film, Sharma says, "About 35 years ago, prenatal sex determination was not a crime. Sarkari hospitals mein bhi hota tha, kyunki yeh population kam karne ka ek maadhyam bhi tha. My father was a priest and poet. He was against it and so he introduced the aathwan vachan (the eighth vow) in the Hindu wedding ritual - vowing not to kill the girl child." Sharma adds, "When people refused to take the vow, he would simply not conduct the ceremony and leave. He also wrote many poems on the issue." The film, made on a budget of Rs35 lakhs, stars actors from the National School of Drama and has been directed by Krishna Nahariya. It has seven songs, six of them written by Sharma's father Kaam Singh and one by Sharma himself. The South City 1 resident says that he thought that a film was the best medium to spread awareness. "I narrated one of my father's poems to my neighbours, who are from Bihar. They were deeply moved, despite not understanding Haryanvi, simply because pain is a universal language. Also, I thought ki agar films criminals ko inspire kar sakti hain (by giving them ideas for crimes), toh baki logon ko kyun nahin," he says. In 1980, Sharma, inspired by Dharmendra, had gone to Mumbai to work in Bollywood, but couldn't find any roles. "Three decades later, after having earned enough money, I again went to Mumbai to give work to Mumbai-based artistes. They again disappointed me. They found no sense in making an issue-oriented film, and asked me to invest in a love story," he adds. Sharma, however, soon found the cast and crew for his film in NCR, and it was released in five districts in Haryana. "My motive was not to earn money, but to send across my father's message. I wanted the state government to promote it, but all they could do was make it tax-free." Sharing another anecdote, Sharma says, "In 2012, a conference for child specialists took place in Gurgaon. Someone told them about my film and they contacted me for a screening. But since most of the doctors didn't know Haryanvi, a team of doctors worked on English subtitles for the film, including the correct medical terms. And the film became one of the few Haryanvi films with English subtitles." Sharma likes to believe that his film might have inspired the current government's Save The Girl Child campaign. "I had shown the film to Somabhai Modi, Narendra Modi's elder brother, during an event. He asked me for a CD, and said that he would show it to the PM. As we all know, the PM launched the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign from Panipat. At the launch of the campaign, artistes sang a song from the film - 'Maa Tu Mane Marvaiye Na'. The song was also made the callertune of all the Haryana government officials who are part of the campaign," says Sharma, who has named his newborn granddaughter NaMo. "The old lady who plays the antagonist in the film has a change of heart at the end of the film. She then travels all across Haryana asking people to take the eighth vow. Similarly, I screen the film wherever I can, and ask people to take the vow," says Sharma.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: A 15-year-old Indian-American boy has won the prestigious 'Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award' for developing a low-cost electronically-aided knee brace that allows a person with a weakened leg to walk more naturally. Syamantak Payra, a Texas resident, won the $50,000 award along with 17-year-old Kathy Liu. The award was given by Intel Corporation and the Society for Science and the Public (SSP) at the 2016 'Intel International Science and Engineering Fair' in Arizona last week. "Our top winners this year, Syamantak and Kathy, clearly demonstrate that age has no bearing on your ability to conduct research and come up with solutions to important problems," said Maya Ajmera, SSP president and chief executive. "We congratulate them not only for their success, but on their dedication and hard work. They and the rest of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) finalists are the rising stars of STEM and we look forward to watching them pursue their passions and in turn make the world a better place for future generations," Ajmera said. When Payra tested his prototype with two individuals partially disabled by polio, it almost immediately restored a more natural gait and increased mobility, according to a statement. "Intel congratulates this year's winners and hopes that their work will inspire other young innovators to apply their curiosity and ingenuity to today's global challenges," Intel Foundation president and Intel Corporation vice president of human resources and director of corporate affairs Rosalind Hudnell said in a statement. 2017's Intel ISEF featured more than 1,700 young scientists selected from 419 affiliate fairs held in 77 countries. A team of students from India also attended the event. Five Indian Americans also figured in the 22 "Best of Category" winners and each received a $5,000 prize. These winners included Rajeev Jha (Hawaii) in the Behavioral and Social Sciences category, Marissa Sumathipala (Virginia) in the Cellular and Molecular Biology, Swetha Revanur (California) in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Tiasha Joardar (Texas) in the Energy: Physical category and Prashant Godishala (Minnesota) in the Translational Medical Science. Under the Intel and Indo-US Science &amp; Technology Forum, three students won the award for a visit to India.</text>

	<text>UNITED NATIONS: A 22-year-old Indian artist is among the three winners of a UN poster competition aimed at raising awareness about nuclear disarmament, with her poster of a peace dove slicing through a nuclear weapon garnering appreciation from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Anjali Chandrashekar, a New York-based designer and "artivist", won the third prize in UN Poster for Peace contest presented by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (ODA) to raise awareness of the need for nuclear disarmament. Titled 'Cutting Barriers through Peace', the poster features a peace dove slicing through a nuclear weapon. (Image: Facebook/art.anjali) She received her third-prize certificate from Ban at an award ceremony held here on May 3. Apart from the three winners, nine honorable mentions were chosen from among more than 4,100 entries representing 123 countries. The young artist was only 10 when she founded 'Picture It', a non-governmental organisation that uses imagery to raise awareness and funds for various health, humanitarian and environmental causes. Another poster 'Break Free' by the Chennai girl, that shows doves flying out of a bird cage at the top of a nuclear weapon, received an honorable mention. "Nuclear disarmament is usually spoken about on such a high level and I believe that art has the power to humanize some of the most pressing issues that the world faces today," she told the UN News Centre. "It also transcends barriers of age, language and literacy so I thought this was a great opportunity for me to show that a brush can be mightier than arms." The first prize went to 38-year-old Ivan Ciro Palomino Huamani from Peru for his 'Spinning Peace', which features a nuclear weapon being unraveled into string which is then used to fly kites and balloons, and to jump rope. Second place winner, 15-year-old Michelle Li, named her poster 'Peace in our Hands', which features a shadow puppet of a peace dove above a broken nuclear weapon. Congratulating the winners, Ban said he commends them for the "talents you have displayed, and for using those talents to highlight such an essential cause." "At a time of many global needs, it is important that young people are aware of the threat posed by nuclear weapons, and the vital importance of disarmament. Young people did not create nuclear weapons, but it may be their task to eliminate them once and for all. The energy and enthusiasm, talent and new ideas we see here today will help to meet that challenge," he said at the award ceremony. Actor Michael Douglas , a UN Messenger of Peace, said that "creativity is essential" to creating momentum for nuclear disarmament. The competition was organised to commemorate the anniversary of the very first UN General Assembly resolution adopted in 1946 establishing a Commission to deal with problems related to the discovery of atomic energy.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: About 1,700 Indian workers who were arrested and deported by Kuwaiti authorities were found violating visa or residency laws of that country, government said today. "There is no problem in the case of people who have valid work visa as their problems are solved under the agreements (with foreign countries)," Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh said during Question Hour in Rajya Sabha. However, the task becomes difficult when workers reach foreign countries on tourist visas and then get them converted to work visas "through dubious means", he said. It is also not possible to keep records of all such people but added that the government reaches out to assist all its citizens promptly if they are found to be in a problem in a foreign land, Singh said. He said the government was sensitive to the needs of its workers and has "effective" agreements with many Gulf countries including Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to ensure their safety. The minister said the government has already set up an Indian Workers Resource Centre in Dubai and will set up two more in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Singh said he and his senior Minister Sushma Swaraj actively check their twitter accounts to reach out to any person needing assistance, while missions abroad were also sensitive to problems faced by any citizen. He said with the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs now merged with MEA, there was more coordinated effort in this regard.</text>

	<text>DOHA: An Indian worker died at the construction site of the Al-Bayt 2022 World Cup Stadium after he fell ill, the tournament's Organising Committee announced on Sunday. The worker, 48, died on Wednesday after suffering a cardiac arrest at the stadium's construction site in the Qatari city of al-Khor. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy of the 2022 World Cup announced that it has opened an investigation into the death of the Indian labourer to determine the circumstances of the incident. The conditions of workers building the Qatar World Cup stadiums have been reported to be very poor by several human rights organisations. Report of the deaths of hundreds of workers have also emerged. In March, Amnesty International warned against labour exploitation of immigrants in the construction work of the 2022 World Cup stadiums and facilities, and said that workers were living in subhuman conditions, without even the most basic of rights.</text>

	<text>Sahota brothers, who emigrated to Canada from the Doaba region of Punjab where every other homestead has an NRI, are today the largest producers of carrots in western Canada. In fact, a packet of carrots, potatoes, cabbage or parsnips at any supermarket in Canada invariably bears the label of Sahotas' Canadian Farms. "Though we produce many crops such as potatoes, cabbage, parsnips, pumpkins and others, we are the largest carrot growers in western Canada. And we are the only producer of baby carrots in the whole of western Canada," says Amrik Sahota, the youngest of the four Sahota brothers who hail from Phalpota village, near Jalandhar, in Punjab. The four Sikh brothers Avtar Sahota, Sucha Sahota, Ranbir Sahota and Amrik Sahota have revolutionized carrot cultivation in Canada. "Our farming operations spread over 900 acres yield the best carrots in Canada. Last year, we produced over 10,0000 tons of carrot and shipped it across Canada, the US and elsewhere. Though the US and Canada are our main markets, we also ship to Dubai and Thailand," says Amrik. In less than three decades, the four hard-working Punjabi brothers have become the top carrot producers by employing state-of-the-art technology. Their sales turnover topped $15 million last year. "We have procured the best technology from around the world to stay ahead of the competition. We have imported costly machines from Germany, Denmark, Holland, the US and Belgium. All our farming from sowing to harvesting are tech-oriented," explains the youngest of the Sahota brothers. Though they employ hundreds of people during their peak season from June to December, Canadian Farms are essentially a state-of-the-art farming operation where just three persons manning one machine can harvest up to 18 tons of crop in 45 minutes! The Sahotas are a typical Punjabi immigrant success story in Canada. Their eldest brother landed as an immigrant in Vancouver in 1970 and then the whole family joined him in 1976. And just like any new immigrant, they worked in factories to make a living in their earlier years. "But farming was in our DNA. So we bought 40 acres in Cloverdale near Vancouver even when we used to work in factories. It was only in 1988 that we decided to make a living out of it," says Amrik. The Sahota brothers started off farming operations with cabbage and lettuces. In 1992, as they just incorporated their operations under the brand name of Canadian Farms, they got lucky when they got a quota to supply carrot to major store chains. As Amrik explains, "Unlike Punjab, we have an organized and regulated marketing system here for farm produce. When we got a quota to supply carrot, it is then when we took its cultivation seriously."</text>

	<text>PHAGWARA: Police on Friday booked the husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law of an NRI woman, for allegedly harassing her for more dowry and forcing her to marry another relative. Police booked Komalpreet Kaur's husband Parvinder Singh, father-in-law Balbir Singh and mother-in-law Balbir Kaur under various sections of IPC. Police said that Baljinder, who lives in the US, had married off his daughter to Parvinder from Nangal Majha village on February 20, 2013. He spent Rs 20 lakh on the marriage and also gave the family expensive gifts. But his daughter's in-laws started demanding a luxury car. They also started insisting that Komalpreet divorce her husband and marry another person from their family so he could also go to the US. When Komalpreet refused, they told her that they had married her to their son so that another relative could travel to the US after their son divorced her. The in-laws forced her to leave her marital home. Upon returning home to her parents, Komalpreet lodged a complaint with the police.</text>

	<text>Investors and taxpayers should complete some tasks this month itself. The madness of March may be over, but if you take up the following tasks in April itself, it can save you headaches later in the year. Start tax planning right away Experts say it is best to start tax planning at the beginning of the financial year. If you plan to invest in ELSS, it is best to start an SIP in April itself. Our research shows that investors who took the SIP route earned more than those who waited till March to invest in ELSS schemes.Staggering the investments across 12 months not only cushions you against volatility, but also lighten the burden at the end of the financial year. TIME REQUIRED: 2-3 HOURS Get papers ready for tax filing The tax filing deadline is three months away, but it will help if you start putting together the information needed for filing returns. If you have foreign assets or earned foreign income during the year, start collecting documents right away. The tax department will be scrutinizing your interest income. Banks credit the interest on the balance in savings bank accounts in October and April. Add the total interest across bank accounts. Also add interest you would have earned on infrastructure bonds, NSCs, fixed and recurring deposits and other fixed income securities. If you have a home loan or an education loan running, get a certificate of interest to know the deduction you can claim. TIME REQUIRED: 2-3 HOURS Increase quantum of investments Your next paycheque could be fatter. You need to increase investments proportionately. Contribution to the EPF automatically. You can also increase the existing SIP amount or start fresh SIPs in other funds. TIME REQUIRED: 2-3 HOURS Submit Form 15G and 15H to avoid TDS This is also the time to file Form 15G or 15H to avoid TDS on interest. Form 15G can be filed by investors below 60 who do not have any tax liability and whose total income from interest is below `2.5 lakh. Form 15H is for individuals above 60. It can be filed if the final tax on the investor's estimated total income is nil.So, if you are above 60, your taxable income can be up to `3 lakh for you to be eligible for 15H. For super senior citizens above 80 years, this limit is `5 lakh. TIME REQUIRED: 1-2 HOURS Give VPF mandate to employer Instead of the PPF which will give 8.1%, salaried individuals can consider the Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF). VPF contributions are eligible for tax deduction under Sec 80C and are tax-free on withdrawal. Even if EPF becomes taxable in later years, the existing corpus will not get taxed. Submit your VPF mandate to the employer immediately. TIME REQUIRED: 15-20 MINUTES Organise investment portfolio If you don't know your asset allocation because all investments are not at one place, start using a portfolio tracker. Value Research has made it simpler for its users. All they have to do is upload the consolidated mutual fund statement and NPS details and all transactions get incorporated into the portfolio. TIME REQUIRED: 1-2 HOURS</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Shrugging off strong macroeconomic data, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell for the second straight session today and settled nearly 58 points down at 26.846.53 as IT stocks continued slide on caution ahead of TCS results. A weak trend in global markets after a data showed slump in Chinese imports, fuelling worries about the health of Asia's largest economy also weighed on the sentiments. Software stocks remained under pressure for the second straight day after Infosys yesterday slashed its dollar revenue guidance, clouding the outlook for the overall sector. The 30-share BSE Sensex after shuttling between 26,918.52 and 26,719.10 during the session finally settled lower by 57.58 points or 0.21 per cent at 26,846.53. The 50-share Nifty too dropped 11.90 points or 0.15 per cent to end at 8,131.70 after dipping below the crucial 8,100 level to hit a low of 8,088.60. The market showed some signs of firmness in early trade on the back of positive macroeconomic data with industrial production grew at a nearly three-year high of 6.4 per cent in August. However, retail inflation rising to 4.41 per cent in September, had a negative impact, and triggered selling. "Indices are struggling to maintain their crucial levels as selling emerges at every rise," said Manoj Choraria, a Delhi-based NSE broker. A cautious stance from the participants trimming positions ahead of the TCS earnings announcement, later in the day, too influenced trading sentiment. Stocks of TCS, country's largest software company, managed to close in the green at Rs 2,597.40 with mild gains. Sensex losers included ONGC, Hindalco, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, GAIL, Sun Pharma, L&amp;T, Hero MotoCorp, SBI, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank and HUL. Bucking the trend, Coal India, Lupin, BHEL, Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, Dr Reddy's, Axis Bank, M&amp;M, HDFC, Cipla, NTPC and RIL notched up gains up to 1.79 per cent. Of the 30-share pack, 15 closed with losses. Sector-wise, IT suffered the most by falling 1.03 per cent, followed by teck with a drop of 0.87 per cent. Broader markets, however, were in better shape as investors made selective buying, with the BSE small-cap rising 0.41 per cent while mid-cap index gained 0.02 per cent. Globally, other Asian markets ended lower with Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng falling up to 1.11 per cent, while European markets were showing an easy trend in their opening deals.</text>

	<text>BHAGALPUR: Train passengers beware! Carrying liquor, travelling after consuming liquor or clandestinely consuming liquor in the running trains would land them in big trouble including jail as the railway passengers have been put under the railway police's scanner. The railway police, on the basis of reports about smuggling of liquor through trains originating from Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, Delhi etc and passing through the state besides consuming liquor kept in cold water bottles being carried by them, have undertaken painstaking initiative to stop the menace. In the special drive undertaken by the government railway police (GRP) between the Kiul-Jamalpur-Bhagalpur-Sahebganj railway section, the police teams of GRP has embarked on drive to check the train passengers and their luggage to stop liquor peddling in the region. Apart from checking the baggage, the GRP is being equipped with 'breathe analyzers' in order to examine the suspected passengers and take legal action against the offenders for having consumed alcohol or consuming alcohol inside the running train, causing nuisance to co-passengers besides violating the new Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016 that prohibits sale and consumption of country-made alcohol (CML) and Indian Made Foreign Liquors (IMFLs) from April 5, 2016. Passengers apart, the staffs of 'pantry car', from where food (eatables) and beverages (cold drinks, tea etc) are supplied to the passengers of long distance trains, have also been put under GRP scanner in the backdrop of reports about alcohol being secretly supplied to some of the passengers. It may be worth mentioning here that a pantry car staff of 'Vikramshila Express' train was arrested by the GRP and forwarded to jail for carrying bottles of liquor recently. Similarly, three train passengers that included a college student and a bank employee were arrested from Jainagar-Howrah (Dhulian) Express train at Pirpainty station for smuggling several bottles of IMFLs from Sahebganj (Jharkhand) to Bhagalpur (Bihar). The trains that have been shortlisted for special drive to check liquor smuggling and boozing by passengers are Vikramshila Express (Bhagalpur-Delhi-Bhagalpur), Lokmanya Tilak Express (Bhagalpur-Mumbai-Bhagalpur), Sahebganj-Danapur Express, Malda-Jamalpur Express, Surat Express (Bhagalpur-Surat-Bhagalpur), Farakka Express (Farakka-Bhagalpur-Lucknow) New Delhi Weekly (Bhagalpur-Delhi-Bhagalpur), Ajmer Shariff Express (Bhagalpur-Ajmer-Bhagalpur), Vananchal Express (Bhagalpur-Ranchi-Bhagalpur) beside other trains. SP (Railways) Swapna Meshram G., who has taken initiative to undertake special checking drive in the running trains, when contacted by TNN, said that we have geared up the railway machinery to stop violation of new excise law that has completely prohibited sale and consumption of liquor in the state. Boozing in trains is a big offence and hence the railway police with the help of 'breathe analyzers' would check suspected passengers and if found guilty then the passengers would be arrested and sent to jail, added the SP (Railways) saying special drive to check liquor peddling through trains has been started and has resulted in recovery of liquor bottles in huge quantities and arrest of some. Awareness campaign including posters, banners etc about new Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016, which not only prohibits sale and consumption of liquor, but, also consist of strict provisions of punishments including imprisonment of 10-years to life imprisonment besides penalty of rupees one to ten lakh, are also being undertaken in this railway section, she added.</text>

	<text>Documenting memories of Partition Old hand-written letters, black-and-white photographs and objects collected from various sources (including families who lived through the Partition) have been displayed at this exhibition in Delhi. The exhibition, which focuses on refugee camps for displaced people set up on both sides of the border after Partition, is an introduction to the Partition Museum that will be coming up in Amritsar soon. "We have been talking to the Punjab government to decide the venue of the museum in Amritsar. It will tell stories of Partition through various artworks, objects etc. While we are setting up the museum, we will keep doing exhibitions like this one so that people remain engaged. After Amritsar, we also have a plan to bring one such museum to Delhi," said Kishwar Desai , who is leading the project, at the opening of the exhibition. The event was attended by Prasoon Joshi and Ritu Kumar , who are on the advisory committee for the project. Tracing her amritsar roots Ritu told us that she grew up in Amritsar, and the house where she spent her childhood will have a lot of memorabilia that she can contribute to the museum. "We have an old house in Amritsar and now that I am associated with the project, I have to visit it and dig out old pictures and objects. I am sure that I will find many things that should be documented. I have already begun," said the designer. Would love to write more on Partition Prasoon made sure that he attended the opening of the exhibition despite hurting his knee playing badminton. "It is a ligament tear," said Prasoon, who was accompanied by his wife Aparna. "My primary reason for writing 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' was that I was moved by what happened during the Partition and how it made someone run so much that he ultimately became a runner. While writing for the film, I researched many stories of Partition," Prasoon added. "I think we should document the memories of Partition so that we can tell future generations about those painful, heart-rending stories. I would want to write more on Partition. A lot more can be done about it in popular culture than what has been done so far. People's expectation from Indian TV is like dal chawal. It is serving comfort food to people. Making something on a subject like Partition will be like throwing a stone in river, something that will create ripples, and I think that should happen," he stressed.</text>

	<text>NOIDA: Smiling as he poses for the cameras flashing at him, the confidence of this 18-year old makes one believe that there can never be a problem! For, it is the moment of Rakshit Malik who has scored 97.4 % in the CBSE Board exam results declared on Saturday. The boy with almost 90 % of visual impairment calmly answers when asked about what is difficult or different regarding his study process. Rakshit has bagged the third rank in the differently-abled category of CBSE results and has also shared the first position in his school, Amity, Sector 44 Noida with Unnati Agarwal. A Humanities student, Rakshit says that the impairment caused more problems with growing age but it never affected his zeal for studies, thanks to his parents and his brother. "I never took any coaching classes. If it were my teachers who would read out my lessons for me during extra hours in school, I had my mother at home who would sit with me and ensure that I don't have a problem", Rakshit told TOI. Till he was in fifth standard, he used to write his exams himself but it was when he reached sixth that his vision started getting blurred. "It was then, that my parents arranged a scribe for me. My brother also has a similar problem and he had also availed the services of a scribe," he said. Over-whelmed with her son's achievement, a teary-eyed Rachna Malik explained that according to doctors, it is a genetic disorder that was found in both her children at a very tender age. "My elder son, who has graduated from SRCC, is also visually impaired. But, we never let it become a hindrance. I would sit with him with his notes prepared in enlarged font and read them out to him. Rest is all his toil, Rachna, a resident of Karkardooma in Delhi told TOI. Blessed with impressive oratory and writing skills, Rachit who has scored a 100 in History says he would either become a civil servant or a lecturer. "I would like to join the IFS if possible but I am doubtful about the criteria. Otherwise, I would like to join the academic field as a lecturer." Last year, the Indian Foreign Service had enlisted its first completely blind official, NL Beno Zephine, a 25-year old literature graduate from Chennai.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: A cancer survivor. A student with learning disabilities. An inspiration to thousands of students out there who are thinking of giving up. Meet Anandini Malhotra, the girl who fought all odds and came out with flying colours in her class 12th CBSE board results that were announced today. Anandini was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a form of cancer, when she was 2.5-year-old. She had a surgery when she was just three-year-old and later developed a spinal condition called kyfoscoliosis as a fallout of the surgery. In 2014, she had a gruelling 28-hour-long spinal reconstruction surgery that left her in immense pain. "She smiled through it all," recalls her mother who calls Anandini 'her inspiration'. Apart from being a cancer survivor, she is also battling dyslexia, a learning disability that interferes with one's learning process. Adhyayan - a coaching centre that specializes in teaching students with learning disabilities, came to her rescue. Using audio visual techniques, flash cards and other methods, Anandini was slowly guided towards excellence. Anandini, who now wants to major in Psychology, had lost her confidence when she was losing out on her grades in school due to her illness and learning complications. "She sailed through all obstacles and came out a winner," says her mother, her voice beaming with pride. Though her school, Convent of Jesus and Mary, was very supportive in nurturing her and catering to her special needs, "the absence of special schools in the city to attend to kids with special needs, is disturbing", says Rajeev Bhatt, her educator at Adhyayan. To all the parents of students who have received their board results today, Anandini's mother has a message, "Always have faith in your children and don't make marks the ultimate criterion for judging your child's worth."</text>

	<text>New Delhi: From next month Air India aircraft flying on the Delhi-San Francisco (SFO)-Delhi route will circumnavigate the earth as it will go round the world in less than 36 hours. The Maharaja currently takes the western route while flying Delhi to SFO by crossing the Atlantic, covering a distance of 13,900 km in up to 17 hours. And it flies back home taking the same route in an hour less. From next month, AI plans to fly east to SFO by crossing the vast Pacific Ocean. While this route is almost 1,400 km longer, the Boeing 777-200 (long range or LR) aircraft will get only strong tail winds on its eastward journey and cut flying time by up to three hours. On the return, the plane will fly over the Atlantic. Thus by the time the plane reaches Delhi, it would have gone round the earth is just about a day-and-a-half. The B-777 200 LR, on an average, burns 9,600 litres fuel for each hour of flying. Reducing the flying time to SFO from an hour (in summer) to three hours (in winter) will mean huge fuel saving. The new route, thus, promises to a win-win for all as travellers will reach SFO faster and the airline will burn less fuel. "The earth rotates from west to east and winds also flow in that direction. Flying west means facing strong headwinds (that decreases an aircraft's actual ground speed) and flying east means getting strong tailwinds, which does the opposite. While taking the (western) Atlantic route to SFO, we usually face headwinds of 24 kmph. If our aircraft is doing 800 kmph, its actual ground speed is 776 kmph. Taking the (eastern) Pacific route to SFO will mean getting tailwinds of 138 kmph which will make the aircraft have an actual ground speed of 938 kmph," said a senior AI official. In summer, flying time to SFO over Pacific will be 16 hours  an hour less than the Atlantic route. And in winter, the difference will be as high as up to three hours between the two routes, said the official. The airline has sent its Pacific route proposal to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation for clearance as no Indian carrier has flown this route nonstop to the west coast. Jet Airways used to have a Mumbai-Shanghai-SFO connection some years ago. The Atlantic route to SFO sees AI fly over Pakistan, Afghanistan, CIS, Russia, Norway, north Iceland, Greenland; crossing the Atlantic to Canada and then entering the US airspace through Seattle. For the Pacific route, AI has chosen this flight plan: Delhi to Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, South Korea, Japan, crossing the Pacific's vast oceanic airspace and then flying directly to the Golden Gate city. AI avoided Russia on this route due to two issues: lack of adequate alternate airports for landing in an emergency and language problems. "We will mostly return to Delhi taking the Atlantic route. But for some days in a year, we may fly over the Pacific if it leads to some time-saving and translate into less fuel burn," said the official.</text>

	<text>The lure of this political spectacle is unmatched as city-based photographer Mahesh Shantaram goes tracking speeches, rallies and the leaders during the recently concluded assembly elections. It started off a chance assignment for an international magazine to cover entrepreneur-turned-politician Nandan Nilekani's political campaign in Bengaluru during the 2014 general elections. Soon, Mahesh Shantaram found himself setting off on "a political backpacking trip" across the country in search of such encounters. After being featured in Tasveer Journal for his photo project 'The Last Days of Manmohan' and entering the British Journal of Photography's list of professionals to watch out for, the 38-year-old photographer hit the campaign trail again to scout for images in Tamil Nadu and Assam last month. To him, the 2014 election was a turning point in many ways. "Since then, I have continued the project by seeking out assembly elections," says Shantaram, who plans to shoot this 'political spectacle' till 2019 and turn it all into a book. And like exit poll pundits, Shantaram is also gobsmacked by Jayalalithaa's comeback. Where all has this journey to photograph the 'tamasha' of politics taken you this year? People get too carried away by the politics of the day . I travel to see politicians perform. I'm interested in the theatre of politics and the visual spectacle that it offers; it is a lens through which to view India itself.This year, I managed to catch the action in Assam and Tamil Nadu. I was struck by the openness and easy-going culture in Assam that was in contrast to the politics of secrecy and suspicion in Tamil Nadu. In Assam, I contacted one MLA (a former home minister) seeking his fifth consecutive term in the assembly on Facebook. When I told him about my project, he immediately invited me to join him on a tour of his constituency right in the middle of a busy election. In Tamil Nadu, a state famously prone to sycophancy and infantile politicians, it wasn't as easy. For instance, to get in touch with Kanimozhi (MP and daughter of DMK leader M Karunanidhi), I contacted many people. When I eventually met Kanimozhi's campaign manager, he was hesitant until I mentioned that I knew Gaurav Gogoi (Congress member and former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi's son). While I got to shoot Kanimozhi, I didn't get to interact with her. As an outsider, do you manage to take photos that may be overlooked by a photojournalist? What is the story you want to tell? On the contrary , it is professional journalists who are outsiders.They are too eager to get a staid picture that merely skims the surface. Such pictures rarely stand the test of time. I stay clear of large election rallies because these are designed to create distance between politicians and people. I try to become an insider as far as possible and get within smelling distance of the action. Aam Aadmi Party launches campaign in Varanasi in 2014. Photo credit: Mahesh Shantaram Was it easy to gain access to politicians? What have been the unconventional ways you have tried to reach out to them? I do whatever it takes- by hook or by crook, and sometimes, going by the book. To catch a politician, you must become the politician. For most of us, TV is the medium through which we see politicians campaigning. I have not had a television since 1994. To satisfy my curiosity , I had to jump right into the ring. When you get closer, you will find that they too have their vulnerable sides, very unlike the glorified figures that we are accustomed to seeing. Beyond the glaze of celebrity spotting, I'm looking for vestiges of politics - - power, hope, frenzy , decadence, decay. What makes India's elections grand spectacles? Politics in the West has become very clinical and sophisticated.Take the current US election campaign for instance. Can you remember any memorable photo? No, because politicians there look like people in business suits attending a corporate conference. Elections in India, on the other hand, are like weddings where you have the politician attending a rally accompanied by his baraat. The reason is that too many people in the country are apathetic and so, in order to get the message across, you need to make a spectacle of it. This is why wherever you go, you will see singing and dancing. In these times of Election Commission Raj, politics is becoming safer and predictable. As a citizen I am grateful. But from the point of view of a photographer, it is terrible! What have been some of the most interesting, unbelievable experiences you have had during the course of this project? I think Pandit Malaviya's (freedom fighter and Congress leader Madan Mohan Malaviya) statue in Varanasi is a ground zero of sorts for several Indian politicians. Many national parties launch their campaign from his statue that is at the entrance of BHU (he founded Banaras Hindu University). I was witness to the legendary Modi vs Kejriwal contest there in 2014. It was an incredible thrill that felt like a special time in a special place. Why have you kept it a self-funded and solo project? The first picture I made as part of this series was during Nilekani's 2014 campaign. At that time, I was on assignment for the Financial Times (UK). It was my first attempt in the political arena. I was so pleased by what I got that I decided to go solo. The simple answer to why I keep it self-funded is independence. What you want to do with the photos you have taken? Is it going to be an ongoing project? A photo project reaches its conclusion when it becomes a book. That happens when the narrative can no longer be improved by adding or removing pictures. To reach that state, I need to shoot for many more years; at least until 2019 to complete a whole cycle of elections.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The Delhi University cutoffs are likely to be quite high this year because of the significant increase in the number of high scorers in the CBSE's Class XII examinations. About 10.8% of the successful candidates--89,030--scored an aggregate of 90% and above while there are 14,838 candidates with more than 95%, a new high. Not everyone is going to line up at DU and also CBSE is yet to give out the number of high scorers from the Delhi region. But consider the fact that DU's total annual intake at the undergraduate level is 54,000. Some college principals believe that though the cutoffs in the first list will remain high, there will be scope for students with a comparatively lower score, especially in sciences, as the number of choices among institutions has increased significantly. In 2010 the number of candidates with an aggregate of 90% and above was 16,563 and with 95% and above, 1,202. Six years on, the number of candidates scoring an aggregate of 90% and above (best five subjects with one language compulsory) has gone up by five times and those scoring 95% and above over 12 times.Just a year ago, the number of candidates scoring 90% and above was 60,000 plus and 95% and above, 12,000. The principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, S K Garg, observed wryly that the cutoffs are no longer decided by DU but by CBSE. "The purpose of any board examination is to grade the candidates into various categories. If the highest category has 14,000 plus students, then how is it possible to segregate them into various sub-categories? It amounts to almost 1,000 candidates on each mark. It is a mockey of the evaluation system," he said. Another principal of a South Campus college said cutoffs could see an "unprecendented rise" as even the other board results have shown a similar trend. But there are those who feel that since DU is not the first choice of many "top scorers", the situation is not as bad as it is being made out to be. "It is difficult to predict the cutoffs right now. We will have to wait and analyse the pre-admission forms. And in any case, the first cutoff will remain high as we play it safe," said Pratibha Jolly , principal of Miranda House. "Not everybody wants to come to DU and choices of institutions have increased in this country ," she pointed out. "Many science students will prefer IISER (Indian Institute of Science Education and Research) or even NISER (National Institute of Science Education and Research).And high-scoring students will be selective in their choice of courses and institutions. There is a paradigm shift; not everyone wants to come and do BSc or BA. Students are discerning and making smart choices and they are not hesitant in exploring professional courses," she added.</text>

	<text>Boxer Vijender Singh is a fan of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and was one of the first guests to arrive at the screening of her latest film, 'Sarbjit' , in Delhi on Friday. He told us he'd been looking forward to the film. "I came a bit early and Aishwarya is yet to arrive, but this is one film which I have been waiting to watch," he said. Aishwarya did arrive soon after, and though she didn't stay for the entire film, she had a message for the guests. She said, "This is an important story which, we believe, needs to be told. We pray that what Dalbirji, Sarabjit, Sukhpreet, Swapan and Poonam experienced in their lives does not happen to anybody ever. It would be wrong to say enjoy the screening, but do experience our piece of cinema." Randeep Hooda's family turned up for the screening, so did director Omung Kumar's. Producers Bhushan Kumar and Jackky Bhagnani were also in attendance. Richa Chadha could not attend as she was busy shooting.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: A 29-year-old teacher from Congo was bludgeoned to death by three men in south Delhi on Friday after an argument over boarding an auto-rickshaw. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras on Asaf Ali Road near Kishangarh crossing, leading police to prime accused Mobin Azad Saifi, a history-sheeter.Saifi was arrested on Saturday and police are probing the possibility of the lynching being a racial attack. The external affairs ministry has sought a report from Delhi Police. Masunda Ketada Olivier and his friend Samuel had gone to meet another friend in Kishangarh on Friday night to borrow money for Olivier's birthday celebrations. He would have turned 30 on Saturday. On their way back, Olivier flagged an auto which stopped a few metres from him. Three men standing nearby boarded it.When Olivier objected, the men abused him. As Olivier retorted, they got off the auto and began thrashing him. The three men pushed Olivier to the ground and kicked him in the face and abdomen. One of the men then picked up a large stone from the roadside and hit Olivier on the head. Seeing Olivier bleed, a passer-by stopped to save him from the attackers but he too was beaten up. Olivier had sent Samuel to buy cigarettes while he looked for an auto-rickshaw. By the time Samuel returned, the attackers managed to flee. "The men threatened me with dire consequences if I tried to stop them and fled into a lane leading to Kishangarh village. I tried to treat Olivier, but his head was badly smashed and he was bleeding profusely . We sought help from passers-by but no one came to our rescue. He was lying on the road for 20 minutes before the PCR arrived," said Samuel. Olivier was rushed to a lo cal private hospital from where he was referred to the AIIMS Trauma Centre. He died on way to the centre. A team from the Vasant Kunj (north) police station reached the scene and recovered CCTV footage from the area. Olivier's mobile phone and the stone used to smash his head were recovered from the spot. DCP south Ishwar Singh said CCTV footage showed Saifi along with his accom plices Prakash Musa and Mukesh walking away from the scene. Police said Saifi was involved in a brawl in 2015 and was jailed for three months. He had met Mukesh and Prakash in jail and the trio had planned to commit crimes together. A case of murder has been registered and a manhunt is on for Musa and Mukesh. Olivier's family is set to reach Delhi on Monday . Samuel said Olivier had come to the city in 2011 to pursue a master's degree in foreign languages from Delhi University . He had lately started teaching French at his rented apartment in South Extension. He had come to India on a student visa and was to go back soon. Samuel said Olivier's parents had to sell a plot to send him to India. "We respect Indians... but they beat him up like an animal and tried to rob his belongings. They fled as Samuel reached the spot," said Jonathan, Olivier's friend.</text>

	<text>Don't make it sound easy and simple! If you can't help the ones who didn't score well, then at least don't hurt them! You scored a 100 in physics. Who does that?! It's not human! Nishant Joke Singh To the girl who scored 497 marks out of 500 in her board exams and made life difficult for others, Sukriti Gupta, You don't know me, but everyone knows you. Congratulations. What you have achieved is spectacular. Your family must be very proud of you. You must be receiving phone calls and messages from everyone to congratulate you for your success. You'll be addressed as 'the CBSE topper' for a long time. It'll be your new identity, and rightly deserved so. You'll be on every news channel and in every newspaper. There will be blogs written about you. However, as I write this piece, I also feel a lot of people being jealous of your achievement. I am one of them. I am 32 years old, but I still remember my Board exam results. I scored less than half of what you have. Thank God you didn't study in my school. Thank God you didn't live in my neighbourhood. However, everyone is not as lucky as me. Have you, for once, thought about the other kids who haven't scored like you in exams? There are kids who play or party or just hang out with friends throughout the year. There are kids who find it boring to complete their assignments. There are kids who are like me. Yesterday, my mom again reminded me of my Board results. She said, "Your life could have been so much better had you concentrated on studies instead of wasting your time. You could have been a doctor, a pilot or an engineer, instead of being a stand-up comedian." It doesn't matter to her that many doctors, engineers and pilots have paid me to tell them jokes and make them laugh. Such is life. You have scored 100 in Physics and Chemistry, and 99 in English, Math and Computer Science. Who does that?! That's not human! I speak, on behalf of all those people, whose scores are not like yours - next time, when you decide to answer all those questions, just think about others who don't know all the answers. As the Dalai Lama XIV once said, "Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them." And everyone else who is reading this letter and hasn't scored well in their board exams, what are you waiting for? Start writing jokes RIGHT NOW. - Nishant Joke Singh READ ALSO Never stressed myself, says CBSE toper Sukriti Tell people it is impossible without divine intervention! Amit Tondon Dear Sukriti, In the next few weeks, quite a few newborns will be named Sukriti, Indian quiz books will add your name to the next edition and your relatives will grow tenfold. Of course, congratulations are in order, but I just have one request - when you talk to press, don't talk as if it was simple and easy. Why did you do this? Sorry, but firstly you score unbelievable marks, and then talk about it as if it is not even that tough! Even when they interview Sachin Tendulkar after a century, he talks about a strategy and gives you an analysis. By the end of it, we understand that this wasn't something that we could have done. So in the case of Sachin, no parents ask their kid "Agar Sachin kar sakta hai toh tu kyun nahin?" My request on behalf of all mediocre students is that at least in your interviews, talk as if you have a God-given talent, or it involved a five-year-long daily ritual by the parents (so that other parents can be equally blamed for the non-performance of their kids). For the next five years, every parent-child conversation among your acquaintances will have the phrase "Sukriti ko dekh..." So if your younger cousins look at you with contempt or friends hug you a little lighter, please understand the emotion. A lot of hopeful parents will bring their kids to you and say, "Beta, isko bhi samhja de thoda." If you have a younger sibling, don't expect too much from him/her in the next few days. If I was your younger sibling, I would advise you to not even drink water served by me. Finally, this is a great opportunity to get all your wishes fulfilled from your parents! Nothing makes an Indian parent happier than a kid who is all over newspapers and is also a topper. So their chequebook belongs to you! From a world tour to a new car or allowing a Facebook account, they will get you anything! Speaking of Facebook, my parting advice would be to STAY AWAY from it right now. Everyone and their cousins are writing about how marks don't matter at all in the long term. This includes celebs as well. So, it will be a bit depressing browsing a world that is screaming that your achieve ment means nothing. So, avoid social media, make a wish list and hand it over to your proud parents. And keep in mind your social responsibility towards the lesser students. Tell people it is almost impossible without divine intervention! - Amit Tandon You'll waltz into the college your choice, but once you get in, you'll have to learn to live in the limelight Papa CJ Dear Sukriti, I got 76% in my Board exam, and failed to get admission into a college and course of my choice. And when I go to work, people laugh at me! And when they do that, it is considered a good result! So heed my counsel in that context, and if it sounds particularly stupid, making it sound sensible was probably in that 24% of the syllabus that I wasn't able to master. One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was that it is important for you to 'grow in the dark'. Once you hit the limelight, you don't have the freedom to mess up. Due to the pressure, you get scared to experiment, and that inhibits your growth. Unbeknownst to you, you have just become a celebrity. You will realise that the first day you step into college, if you haven't already. Sukriti, you will face challenges that others will not. The problem with getting to the very top is that staying there is very hard and often, there is only one direction you can go if you don't stay there. You'll waltz into the college and course of your choice, but once you get in, you'll have to learn to live in the limelight. If you will allow a 76 percenter to share some counsel, let me say this - celebrity is a currency. You can decide how you choose to spend it. While you may never be asked about your marks again, the quality of your relationships will have far greater bearing on the quality of your life than this outstanding academic achievement. I'd like to end by quoting Sukriti Gupta , Class 12 CBSE topper 2016 - "You need to get your basics right, and then the rest is not that hard to crack. I have been consistent throughout and that helped me." Follow her example, and with luck, life will be as kind to you as the examiners were! Congratulations and all the very best! -Papa CJ READ ALSO Sukriti Gupta tops CBSE Class 12 exams You don't need luck because you already have the skill Radhika Vaz Dear Sukriti, Congratulations! Ok look, you have no idea who I am, so I hope you won't be too weirded out by this open letter. Or let's just call it fan mail because that is what this is. You have fans now because you are famous. Which, in your case, is good, because you are famous for being smart and hardworking - two things I am but very rarely at the same time. And that is why I admire people who excel - whether it's you or Usain Bolt. It takes two things to be a baller - talent and discipline. Of course, the talent part is easy, it's the daily grind that's the hard part. And to see someone so young have the maturity to recognise that is thrilling. Sukriti, what you have done is praiseworthy. Because you have done is not because of our educational system or because of the support our country gives young women, but despite it. The fact that your family has supported you, and pushed you to become a role model at such a young age, is truly incredible. I hope you will always be the feminist you are - leading the way for the rest of us, showing us that women can, and they will not be left behind. You don't need luck because you already have the skill, so I will sign off with my love. Yeah, I think I just made that creepy, but there you go... -Radhika Vaz</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Even as Delhiites are suffering from regular power cuts in this sweltering heat, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday said that his government was personally attending to every complaint it received. He said that a policy will also be enforced under which compensation would be provided to people suffering from power cuts for more than two hours. Kejriwal said his government would ensure that consumers who face unscheduled outages are compensated. Policy directions have already been issued to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC), which will come out with a notification soon. "In Delhi, there have been many power cuts lately and for the past few days I have been monitoring the situation. In the BSES areas, the power cuts are more than usual. In comparison, in areas under Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, the cuts are fewer. On Friday, the power minister took cognizance of the matter and we are personally observing all the complaints that are coming through," said the CM. Kejriwal said he would not let the power utilities get away with blaming the cuts on local faults. "It's time to take the power companies to task. Every time they come up with an excuse blaming local faults... then they should also assess why these faults are happening. I have been getting a huge number of complaints... in fact I have been attending to complaints of power cuts throughout the night," he said. When told that discoms needed to be dealt with a stick, the CM assured that the government "has a stick to deal with the power companies and there was no shortage of sticks". Stating that he has called a meeting regarding the matter on Monday, Kejriwal added that he has given direction to the DERC that when there is an 'unscheduled' power cut, it has to be fixed within two hours and if it is not done so, then the people in that area will be compensated. The CM's statements were echoed by power minister Satyender Jain, who held a media conference later in the day to address the situation. "There is no shortage of power availability. Power cuts are only on account of local faults and this proves that the power utilities have failed in routine maintenance of their infrastructure. We have issued directions to DERC under Section 108 to penalise the discoms whenever unscheduled power cuts are reported and the notification should be out soon. The compensation amount for those who suffer outages will be reflected in the electricity bills," said the minister. Jain also said that many consumers have complained that discom call centres keep them waiting for upto 20 minutes and even after that their complaints are not resolved. "Call centres have been told that they have to call back each and every consumer who registers a complaint to ensure their problem is resolved. We have also said that these calls should be recorded so we can monitor them," he added. "Two reasons for privatisation was investment into the sector and its maintenance. And it's pretty obvious that the discoms have not invested enough in maintenance of the infrastructure," the minister said.</text>

	<text>Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee woke up early on Friday morning as a crowd was impatiently waiting in front of 30B Harish Chatterjee Street to take a glimpse of their favourite leader. She came out of her home at 8.30am and received flower bouquets from visitors who had come from various parts of the city. Didi shook hands with some of them and later handed over packets of sweets to the children. Mamata's residence on Friday turned into a centre of celebration with VIPs, administrators, event managers, journalists and visitors making a beeline to meet her either to chalk out future plans or enquire about the grand swearing-in ceremony to be held on May 27. Banerjee had convened a meeting of the newly-elected MLAs. But before anybody from her team of 210 MLAs could reach her house, Banerjee reportedly held a closed-door meeting with her trusted lieutenants Subrata Bakshi and Mukul Roy. "The names of probable ministers in the next cabinet were discussed in the meeting," said a source. The meeting with the MLAs started with a loud applause for Didi for the historic victory of the party despite threat from alliance. The meeting ended with a note of caution - introspection in the rank and file of the party following failures in some key assembly constituencies, including Jadavpur. The newly-elected MLAs were offered fish fry, fried rice, chicken and sweets. However, Mamata opted for a light lunch - rice and 'kalmi saag' with chilly. After spending a while in her room speaking to family members, she went back to her lucky office room where she held a series of meetings till the evening. The IAS association members led by chief secretary Basudev Bandopadhyay met her. An IPS delegation was in the queue. Mamata called them in and passed on necessary instruction especially in the wake of escalating political tensions. Mamata, however, did not forget to discuss about the swearing-in ceremony which will be held on Red Road. "This function is very close to Didi's heart. This time she has chosen Red Road to make sure that even common people can become a part of it. We have been flooded with requests for passes from the people of her locality. We will also take our family members there," said Karthick Banerjee, Mamata's brother. In fact, she has asked senior Trinamool Congress leaders to form a committee that will look after the preparations for the swearing-in ceremony. "I will be happy if people in large numbers take part in the ceremony," Mamata said.</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: Four climbers from Kolkata summitted Mt Everest on Saturday morning, but the cheer was dampened by reports that three other climbers may be missing in what's known as the `Death Zone' -8000m and above. The grim news comes just a day after news reached that Everester Rajib Bhattacharya was killed on the descent from Mt Dhaulagiri, the seventh highest peak. While Ramesh Roy, Malay Mukherjee, Satyarup Siddhanta and Rudraprasad Haldar stood on top of the world at 5.40am and were back in Camp IV by Saturday evening, there has been no contact with climbers Sunita Hazra, Gautam Ghosh and Paresh Nath since Friday evening. They were last tracked at 7.30pm on Friday when they started their climb for the summit. "We have not heard anything about them since then," said Sudeb Hazra, Sunita's husband. Both groups were with different agencies. The four that are confirmed safe were with 7-Summit agency. Its owner Mingma Sherpa confirmed that they reached Camp IV at 7.50pm. Those yet to be traced are with Loben Expedition, which has an office in Darjeeling. Curiously, the family of a Loben climber, Subhas Pal, were told that he was seen around 11.30am on Saturday climbing down to Camp IV along with the four from 7-Summit. For the friends and family of Ramesh, Malay, Satyarup and Rudraprasad, it's a day of celebration. Satyarup's friend Tirthankar Pyne told TOI how he was tracking him via a GPS gadget he had strapped on."At 5.40am, it flashed on my laptop screen -8,848 meters! I knew it was emitting from Satyarup's GPS. My friends and I were glued to GPS tracking websites all night, checking every movement of the four-member team," he said. The last update on Satyarup's Facebook page was at 6.30pm on Friday: "With all ur blessings starting for the final push. Keep us in ur prayers." The phrase "final push" told his friends that they were striking out for the summit. They had arrived at South Col at 1.30pm and rested a while before going for the peak. Beyond Camp IV , the final outpost between Everest and Lhotse at an altitude of around 26,000 feet or 8,000 meters, is what mountaineers call the Death Zone. Here, a climber's body stops acclamatising and starts dying slowly till the climber returns to below 8,000m. Till Camp IV , all eight climbers from Kolkata were in good health. On Lhotse face, a Sherpa met with an accident and died while opening the route, say sources. There were also issues with the oxygen in stock but it was sorted out. "They had chosen this time of the year as the weather forecast was good. They expected it to be less windy ," said Tirthankar.Things didn't go according to plan, though. On May 5, the weather was fluctuating at Camp II. Till Camp IV , the climbers had to retuern to the previous camps for better acclamatisation. Till May 7, they had only touched 7,100m. More challenges came when the team's oxygen was used by another team. But the four made it to the top. "It was Ramesh's second try . Last year, they reached base camp the day Nepal suffered a devastating earthquake. They had to come back and the entire investment was a loss. It was hard arranging funds this year," said Tirthankar. Ramesh, a Central Excise inspector, is a veteran climber. While Satyarup has conquered six of the seven top summits, Malay has scaled Kamet summit -the second highest mountain in the Garhwal region. On May 19, Satyarup posted on Facebook: "Our summit day so far is 21st early morning." They had chosen to scale the summit during sundown as days are even deadlier with chances of molten ice causing fatalities. Kolkata is already celebrating the success of Pradeep and and his wife Chetna Sahoo who reached the summit on Thursday along with teammate Debraj Dutta. It was the couple's third attempt after two failed tries.</text>

	<text>Kolkata: CPM's Sujit Chakraborty won from Barjora in Bankura defeating actor Sohom Chakrabarty by a margin of only 616 votes. Deboshree Roy defeated CPM veteran Kanti Ganguly from Raidighi in South 24-Parganas by 1229 votes. They couldn't have made it without the NOTA (None of the Above) votes that in a way became the deciding factor in these constituencies. Here, NOTA votes were higher than the victory margin. In Barjora, the votes polled in favour of NOTA was 4235, and in case of Raidighi it was 1710. NOTA votes are higher than the victory margin in as many as 21 constituencies. If this is a trend, it displays the underlying facts over vote transfers. "There has been an alliance between our party and the Left. The top leaders have decided it. But how could I cast my vote for a party that has been our enemy since years? Rather, I decided to cast my vote in favour of NOTA," an assistant secretary of Congress told TOI on condition of anonymity. If this gave advantage to Trinamool, there are instances where faction feuds within Trinamool triggered a rise in NOTA votes. Among these 21 constituencies, six went to Left and four with Congress. Chhatna in Bankura recorded the highest NOTA polling - 7709 - where RSP candidate Dhirendranath Layel defeated Trinamool candidate Subhashis Batabyal by a margin of 2417 votes. Take the example of Kalchini where Trinamool candidate Wilson Champamari won by a margin of 1511 when the number of NOTA votes was 4524. Indranil Sen of the ruling party won from Chandernagore by a margin of only 2114 votes when the NOTA figure was as high as 3853. This is also true in case of Tamluk where Nirbed Roy lost to Ashok Dinda of CPM by a margin of 520 votes. But, 2394 NOTA votes were polled here. Records show a total of 8.30 lakh people in Bengal opted for NOTA. This is more than the four other states - Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry - that went to the polls this year. When asked about it, Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty said, "There are people from both Congress and Left who couldn't give their votes to the parties they considered to be their main rival for so many years. This resulted in the rise in the NOTA percentage. Since NOTA is a relatively new thing, people were not aware of it in the last two elections. I believe that with time this number will increase. The young generation who are politically disillusioned and didn't want to waste their votes chose NOTA as the best alternative."</text>

	<text>Coimbatore: With exit polls in their favour, the DMK was expecting to win by a huge margin. As the day dawned, the DMK office in the city was vibrant with activity. As they were debating on what margin they would win, they got a harsh reality check from news channels which began announcing that the AIADMK was in the lead. Soon the mood became sombre, with party workers making frantic calls to their functionaries stationed at the counting centres, to confirm what they were hearing. However, even at this point, the DMK did not lose hope. As the day progressed, it was difficult to keep hope alive, especially when Modi tweeted at 11am to congratulate Jayalalithaa on her victory. On the other hand, the day started on a quiet note for AIADMK cadres with very few people in the party office. Most candidates were at the counting centre discussing the progress. As their leads increased gradually, they became more relaxed and returned to the office. Waiting for the final results, the cadres slowly began gathering at the party office located at Anna Salai at 3pm. The mood was still very restrained with occasional claps and whistles when remarks on AIADMK victory was were made. Only when Jayalalithaa spoke to her party men through television, did the crowds begin to celebrate with abandon. The BJP camp was much more relaxed where candidates could be seen sipping a cup of coffee and munching on snacks. While in all other party offices, cadres were glued to the television, cadres in the BJP office were in front of the computer analysing the results round wise and also trying to analyse the outcome. Also, this was the only party office, where the candidates was present. Even as the candidates expressed their concern over the results, the cadres tried to lift the mood by saying they should wait for final results to be announced. In the evening, when AIADMK won nine of the ten constituencies, the victorious candidates received their certificates at the counting centre while cadres distributed sweets and burst crackers. The DMK party office, on the other hand was silent and there was a wave of disappointment in the air. Unable to understand the reason, the cadres said money power of the ruling party had worked against them.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: BJP workers on Sunday staged a demonstration outside the CPM headquarters here, broke police barriers and damaged their signboard in protest against the murder of a party worker allegedly by supporters of the Left party during a poll victory rally in Kerala. BJP has been targeting the Left over the alleged attacks on its workers in Kerala in the run up to the polls. Several police teams were deployed and a four-tier security arrangement was made around the CPM office in New Delhi's Gole Market area this morning. CPM workers had also come out of the building to confront the protesters and a minor scuffle broke out when a group of BJP workers broke police barriers and damaged the signboard at the CPM headquarters. The groups were separated by the police and no injuries were reported, police maintained. "Around 600 people have been detained under provisions of law and the situation is under control," DCP (New Delhi) Jatin Narwal said. Holding that the protest was peaceful, Delhi BJP spokesman Praveen Kapoor said, "Police detained our leaders and workers but not the CPM workers who resorted to violence. Hundreds of party workers, including Delhi in-charge Shyam Jaju and president (Satish Upadhyay) have been detained." CPM leader Prakash Karat said, "No one was injured in the attack. But the police personnel deployed there did not prevent them from coming up to the office." A police complaint has been lodged in connection with the incident, a CPM worker said. On Thursday, BJP worker Pramod (38) had sustained head injuries after he was allegedly hit by a brick following a clash during a victory rally by CPM workers at Idavilangu in Kerala. He died the next day. BJP chief Amit Shah had yesterday accused the Left Front of "violating" the people's mandate. BJP had said it will not sit quiet if the "cycle of violence" continues in the state as it claimed that it has emerged as a powerful alternative voice to the two main fronts led by CPM and Congress. Kapoor said, "The protest is against the violence in Kerala and the killing of our party worker there." The protesters started marching in groups from the Delhi BJP office in Pandit Pant Marg and gathered outside the outer-most barricading near the Left party's office.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Lamborghini rolled out its new $580,000 supercar onto the streets of India this month, but local millionaires tempted to buy the flashy convertible could hit a bump in the road thanks to the taxman. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to crack down on tax avoidance - notorious in India especially among the super rich - to tackle yawning inequality in the world's second-most populous nation. Figures published last month for the first time since 2000 showed just how few of India's top earners pay tax. Only six people earning over 500 million rupees ($7.4 million) filed returns in 2012-13. The numbers are hard to square with the estimated 2,100 ultra-wealthy Indians whose net worth exceeds $50 million, according to the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, or a Forbes list that found 84 billionaires. New Delhi's glitziest hotels host week-long, multi-million dollar weddings, drawing thousands of guests, with parties awash with Veuve Clicquot and DJs flown in from Ibiza. But now the government's top taxman is looking to join the dots, by cross-checking income declarations with data from luxury car dealerships -- as well as property registers, fixed bank deposits and stock market transactions. "The people in the higher bracket are not paying the correct amount of taxes. This is a fact," revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia told AFP of the new initiative. "We need to do something about it. We are taking a lot of enforcement action." Billions of dollars in unpaid taxes deprive the Indian government of revenues that could be spent on changing lives in a country where 270 million people survive on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank. But rounding up tax is difficult when dodging it is practically a national sport, from small-time landlords who request rent in cash to large-scale money laundering via state lotteries. Andrea Baldi, head of Asia Pacific for Lamborghini, said tracking its sales is unlikely to net the government many avoiders. "The people in India who are not declaring their tax are not the kind of people that will buy a very flashy car and drive in front of the entire city displaying their wealth." Across all levels of society, India's taxpayers are startlingly few, with only around 2.5 percent of its 1.2 billion population filing returns -- largely because the so-called unorganised sector employs so many people. "We've always had the sense that the tax base is really, really poor, that we need to build up taxation, but it does come as a bit of a shock," said Sonu Iyer, a partner at EY, of the recent data. "The numbers get progressively poorer as you move up the ladder." At least 500 Indians including Bollywood celebrities, business tycoons and an ex-cricketer were named in the recent Panama Papers investigation as using tax havens -- a practice not, in itself, illegal. But the revelations prompted Modi, who has made tackling "black money" a tenet of his two years in office, to order an investigation. Rules introduced this year make it mandatory to declare a unique taxpayer number when purchasing goods over 200,000 rupees and to pay one percent in tax when buying cars over one million rupees. And this month the government closed a major loophole in Mauritius, where a decades-old treaty enabled people to route cash via the island without paying capital gains tax. Yet some of India's wealthy are not obliged to pay income tax at all. Agricultural income is not taxed, which has long been a sensitive issue because of an oppressive colonial practice of taxing farmers heavily. "Some states like Punjab have some very wealthy farmers, but because there is no tax on agricultural income they are outside the purview (of tax authorities)," said Suresh Surana, an accountant in Mumbai. New Delhi was nudged into releasing income tax data after celebrated economist Thomas Piketty, known for his work on inequality, publicly chastised the government for withholding it. Although an interesting snapshot, Piketty told AFP it falls short of what is needed to gauge the full picture. "At this stage the data that was released is insufficient for a proper analysis," he said, adding that "one cannot draw any conclusion about inequality". The government says it is a start -- and that greater transparency will kickstart a culture of shame, rather than begrudging admiration, for those who keep their money out of the taxman's hands. "By putting this data in the public domain the public discussion has started," Adhia, the revenue secretary, said. "You are saying, 'it is very bizarre that in a big country with so many wealthy people and palaces, you are having only so many people paying tax.' That will be the talk of the town."</text>

	<text>NEW YORK/LONDON: Legal proceedings in India against beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya have now come to haunt his US-based brewery firm, which is banking on $1 million bridge loan promised by his holding firm for survival. "Vijay Mallya, the company's chairman and indirect majority shareholder, is presently subject to certain legal proceedings in India, which may impair the company's ability to obtain financing from UBHL (United Breweries Holding Ltd) and other potential funding sources," California-based Mendocino Brewing Company Inc said in a regulatory filing. Mallya, who is at the centre of a major controversy for the huge loan defaults by his group in India, controls over 68 per cent shareholding held through UBHL in Mendocino. This is probably the first admission by the US-listed firm, which is struggling for funds and has been served 'default' notices by lenders in the past, about the potential impact of Mallya's legal woes in India on its own fortune. As of March 31, 2016, MBC had cash and cash equivalents of $52,900, an accumulated deficit of over $18 million, and a working capital deficit of over $12 million due to losses incurred, and debts. If it fails to secure funds, Mendocino said, the lenders may take "recourse against the applicable pledged collateral which includes the company's real and personal property in the US and the UK". In its latest quarterly filing with the US markets regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mendocino further said, "The board of directors of UBHL during this quarter has approved debt financing to the company in the form of $1,000,000 of bridge loans. "If UBHL does not consummate such debt financing, it would have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and the company's ability to continue to operate." The company disclosed that its total assets declined to $16 million as on March 31, 2016 -- lower than the total liabilities worth more than $18 million. In the quarter ended March 31, it recorded total sales of about $6.9 million, but suffered a net loss of $637,100. Mallya got a pay package of over Rs 1.7 crore in 2015 from this US-based company, more than half of which was paid by Mendocino to him for "promoting" the company's beer brands. Mallya serves as Chairman of the board of directors of the company, which has an exclusive licence to brew and distribute Kingfisher Premium Lager in various countries. Besides, it produces and sells a number of craft beer brands. United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL), the holding firm of Mallya-led UB Group, is the "indirect majority shareholder" of Mendocino Brewing Company (MBC). Mendocino's North American operations primarily consist of brewing and marketing proprietary craft beers. Its foreign operations are conducted through wholly-owned subsidiary United Breweries International UK Ltd (UBIK) and a step-down unit Kingfisher Beer Europe Ltd. The two largest shareholders of Mendocino are United Breweries America (UBA) and Inversiones, both of which are controlled by Rigby International Corp, a company registered in the British Virgin Island. Rigby, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBHL.</text>

	<text>ITANAGAR: At least 17 people were killed and several injured when the vehicle in which they were travelling skidded off the road and fell into a deep gorge in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh on Sunday. The mishap occurred at around 12.30pm on Rupa Kalaktang road when the pick-up vehicle was on its way to Betchelling village, power minister TN Thongdok, who represents the area, said over phone. Thongdok has rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. "I am in touch with administration and have apprised Chief Minister Kalikho Pul who has assured all possible relief. ... Let us pray for peace of all departed souls. Condolence to families of the victims," Thongdok said. Senior police and administration officials in the district could not be contacted due to poor telecommunication link. The district is 350km from capital Itanagar.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday praised Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for taking time out to visit NIS Patiala - to check on the sportspersons training for the Rio Olympics - despite it being election season in his home state of Assam. "There were polls, he was a CM candidate performed his duty as a sports minister. This is a big thing" the PM said in his 'Mann Ki Baat' address, about the minister who's set to become Assam's first BJP chief minister after a historic BJP win there. The PM added that the country's athletes need to be encouraged, more than anything else. "When we talk about the Olympics we do feel sad at the medal tally. But we need to create the right atmosphere to encourage athletes. I will say it again, please do not see everything as a win or loss," the PM said. Similarly, Modi said, parents of students whose board exam results have just been declared must be easy on their children and be satisfied with their results. They should motivate their children, the PM added. "Gaurav from MP commented he scored 89% and I was very happy but he said his family was not happy and they wanted him to get 90. Why to find negativity from everything. It would be better if everyone around you had celebrated your scores," the PM said. The Prime Minister, like in his address on April 24, also spoke about how imperative it is to conserve water even as drought-like conditions are creating havoc in many parts of India. "We feel refreshed splashing water on our faces when we feel tired, this is such a precious gift of god. I appeal to citizens to pledge to not waste water in June, July, August, September this year," the PM added. The Prime Minister also spoke about health issues and in this connection said he's planning to attend the second International Yoga Day programme in Chandigarh. "On June 21, International Day of Yoga, I will join a programme in Chandigarh to practice yoga with them," he said. "Yoga Day is not merely an event, it inspires to include it in our daily routine for 20-30 minutes."</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The recent assembly polls in four states and the Union Territory of Puducherry did not bring good news for over 3,500 independent candidates as only nine of them could win. Of those successful, the maximum six won from Kerala and one each from West Bengal, Assam and Puducherry. None of the 1,566 independent candidates, the highest among the four states, could win from Tamil Nadu. A total of 3,526 independent candidates contested the assembly polls. Of these, 782 were in Kerala, 711 in Assam, 371 in West Bengal and 96 in Puducherry, according to an analysis of Election Commission's data. Polls were held between April 4 and May 16 for a total of 822 constituencies in the four states  West Bengal (294), Tamil Nadu (232), Kerala (140), Assam (126) and Union Territory of Puducherry (30). Polls in two constituencies of Tamil Nadu were deferred. As many as 8,873 candidates had contested the polls. The highest number of 3776 were in Tamil Nadu, 1,961 in West Bengal, 1,581 in Assam, 1,203 in Kerala and 344 in Puducherry. Of the total of 761 women candidates, as many as 320 were in the fray in Tamil Nadu, 200 in West Bengal, 111 in Assam, 109 in Kerala and 21 in Puducherry.

	<text>NEW DELHI: The CBI has summoned Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat for questioning on Tuesday in connection with a sting operation that shows him allegedly offering bribes for support before a crucial floor test. On March 26, nine rebel Congress leaders released the sting video and alleged that Rawat tried to buy their support for a floor test - to prove his majority - by offering them money. That floor test never took place as the Centre imposed President's Rule in Uttarakhand on March 27 saying Rawat lost his majority when the same nine Congress legislators rebelled. Uttarakhand plunged into a political crisis when the nine Congress lawmakers went against their own government in a debate on an Appropriation Bill earlier in March during the Budget Session of the Assembly. The Centre on May 11 revoked President's rule in Uttarakhand after Congress chief minister Rawat proved his majority in a floor test held May 10. The nine rebel MLAs weren't allowed to vote. In the last week of April, the CBI registered a preliminary enquiry into the sting operation. The home ministry sent the sting CD to a Chandigarh forensics laboratory for examining its authenticity. The Central Forensic Science Laboratory, in its report submitted to the government, said that the sting operation CD released by rebel Congress leaders against Rawat is genuine. Also, in the last week of April, Rawat almost accepted his presence in the sting tape. He said meeting a journalist was not a crime. "Is meeting a journalist a crime? If one of the MLAs who had not been technically disqualified by that time talked to me ... how does it matter? Do we block any channels in politics?" Rawat had told reporters.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: BJP leader and former IPS officer Kiran Bedi has been appointed Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. "The President of India has been pleased to appoint Ms. Kiran Bedi, to be the Lt. Governor of Puducherry with effect from the date she assumes charges of her office," a release from Rashtrapati Bhavan said on Sunday. Bedi was BJP's chief ministerial candidate in the last Delhi assembly elections, which the party lost to Arvind Kejriwal's AAP. Kiran Bedi was the first woman officer in the Indian Police Service when she joined in 1972. She has held key positions including Inspector General (Prisons) at Delhi's high-security Tihar Jail. Her work in one of Asia's largest jails led to her winning the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. After retirement, she partnered Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal in their movement against corruption and for a strong Lokpal but later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of the February 2015 Delhi assembly polls. Under her, the BJP was virtually wiped out, winning only three seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly while she herself lost in the Krishna Nagar constituency in east Delhi. The Congress-DMK combine won the just-concluded assembly elections in Puducherry, securing a simple majority of 17 in the 30-member assembly. For the Congress, this win was the only saving grace amid defeat in two key states of Kerala and Assam and dismal performance in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. (With inputs from agencies)</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Linking the intense heatwave and drought to environmental degradation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today made a strong pitch for a mass movement to save forests and conserve "every drop" of water during the upcoming monsoon season. Modi, who has been reviewing drought situation with chief ministers recently, said a number of states have taken some good initiatives towards water conservation and that he had asked Niti Aayog to study the best practices for their replication all over the country. In his monthly radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat', he also talked about some other issues, like the need for moving towards cashless society for transparency and curbing black money. During the 30-minute broadcast, the Prime Minister urged the countrymen to practice Yoga for illness-free life and informed that on the International Yoga Day on June 21, he would join a programme in Chandigarh. Referring to the intense heatwave being witnessed in the country, he said concerns increased few days back when news came in that monsoon could be delayed by a week beyond June 1. "Most parts of the country are experiencing intense heatwave. Be it humans, birds or animals, all are troubled. It is only because of environment that such problems continue to increase. Depletion of forests has been going on, trees continue to be cut. In a way, the humankind itself destroyed the environment and put itself on the path of destruction," he said. He mentioned the recent cases of fire in forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, and said the root cause of such incidents is that there are dry leaves and little carelessness. "That is why, saving forests and conserving water becomes everybody's responsibility," Modi said while underlining the need for saving "every drop" of water, which he described as "God's 'prasad'". "I urge the countrymen, let us decide that we will not let even a drop of water go waste during June, July, August and September (comprising Monsoon season).The issue of water concerns not only the farmers but everybody. The rainy (Monsoon) season is coming. Start the preparations now to see where to save water," he said. "I urge you. Do not let this (Monsoon) season go. In the coming four months, a mass movement in the form of 'Save Water Abhiyan' is needed to save every drop of water. And this task is not only of the governments or politicians but that of the common masses," he said, seeking contribution from the media too in this endeavour.</text>

	<text>TEHRAN: India's flagship explorer ONGC is facing a repeat of KG fiasco in Iran as lengthy negotiations on terms may drive it to a point where its discovered gas reserves in Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf may be drawn out by neighbouring Saudi Arabia. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) alleges that 11.12 billion cubic meters of natural gas worth Rs 11,055 crore has flowed from its idling Krishna Godavari basin blocks in Bay of Bengal blocks to neighbouring KG-D6 fields of Reliance Industries. And the same is now on the verge of repeating in the Farzad-B field, which it had discovered in 2008 but no contract to exploit the 12.5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable reserves has so far been concluded with Iran. Sources said a portion of Farzad-B field extends into territorial waters controlled by Iran's regional arch-rival Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has already drilled wells on the area falling in its territory, which it has named Hasbah field, and has begun production. The two fields are connected, with the area falling in Iranian territory holding larger share of 12.5 Tcf of recoverable reserves while the Saudi territory has only 3 Tcf or so. But the two fields are connected and whosoever is able to move first would extract more benefits. Sources said in the dispute with RIL, ONGC is claiming compensation for its gas flowing through under-sea connected reservoir to KG-D6 and the government has constituted a one-man committee to look into the issue and suggest compensation. But such a thing may not be possible for Farzad-B as rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran may prevent from arriving at any internationally recognised practice of splitting the spoils in conjoined fields. It was expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Tehran today and tomorrow may see finalising of a contract, giving developmental rights of Farzad-B field to ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of the state explorer. But Iran is yet to agree to USD 4.3 billion master development plan submitted by OVL. Also, it is yet to agree on the price at which OVL can take all of the gas produced from the field, they said adding that no definitive contract for the development of the field would be signed during Modi's visit.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: BJP workers held a demonstration outside the CPM office on Sunday to protest the murder last week of a colleague allegedly by supporters of the Left party in Kerala. Police detained around 150 protestors. Pramod, a 38-year-old BJP worker, was attacked with bricks during victory celebrations of a Left candidate at Kaipamangalam in Thrissur district on Thursday. He died on Friday. BJP district president A Nagesh alleged that some of the CPM activists who carried out the attack against Pramod were accused in a case relating to the murder of the Yuva Morcha leader Sathyesh in 2006. He also alleged that the CPM supporters had unleashed a series of violent acts in different part of the district on Thursday under the cover of victory celebrations. The Left Democratic Front emerged the winner of the Kerala state polls, the results of which were declared on Thursday, May 19. CPM district secretary K Radhakrishnan denied that the CPM was involved in the murder or in any other violence in the district. He added that the area is an RSS stronghold and that there are local disputes between activists of the BJP and RSS. A BJP delegation led by transport minister Nitin Gadkari is scheduled to meet President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday to lodge a formal protest about the violence that took place in Kerala on May 19-20. BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday accused the Left of "violating" the people's mandate. He said the BJP "will not sit quiet and will fight on the streets if the cycle of violence continues".</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: As Modi government nears its second anniversary, industry body Assocham today said "a lot more is required" to be done on tax disputes and concerns remain on huge toxic assets in the banking system. Calling the NDA government "a work in progress", the business lobby group gave it an overall performance rating of 7 on a scale of 10. On the country's macroeconomic picture, Assocham said it has "certainly been steadied while some bold moves have been made in roads, highways, railways and energy sectors". However, it called for an "aggressive" approach to tackle problems faced by the agriculture sector and uplift the country's vast rural population". According to Assocham President Sunil Kanoria, the wish-list includes considerable traction in disinvestment, resolution of taxation disputes, agriculture reforms and most importantly the GST Bill, adding that a "lot more is required as far as tax disputes and litigation are concerned". "It would be only fair to call the NDA government as work in progress since it would take time before projects in sectors such as the railways and the highways bear fruit. However, the bigger area of concern, the huge toxic assets of the public sector banks, remains, mainly because of business downturn," Kanoria said. "The government and RBI both need to handle the issue of non-performing assets (NPAs) with extreme care and banks should be empowered to take commercial decisions in the case of stressed assets without any fear of facing reprisals on post-mortem of their actions at a much later date." He pointed to the non-passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill as one of the sticking points, "which does not appear to be happening any time soon either, given the surcharged political environment and the back-to-back elections in the state assemblies". On crucial sectors such as health and education, India Inc does not rate the government's performance as much as it was expected, as per Assocham's assessment. "While Skill India and Start-up India are great moves along with Jan Dhan Yojna, much more is required in providing adequate and quality education. Besides, public expenditure on health sector needs to go up and dependence on insurance alone would not be sufficient," the chamber stated.</text>

	<text>By William H Avery The India-US relationship is stuck in a rut. A rut of worn-out bilateral bromides: "strategic partnership", "largest democracies" and "people-to-people exchanges". There is nothing wrong with such talk. But let us be honest: these are the sort of things diplomats work on when they are out of other ideas. The US presidential election in November now seems certain to pit Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton . Clinton is a known quantity to Indian government officials: First Lady for eight years, US senator for another eight, then secretary of state for four. All the while she has been a friend of India. If elected president, she will work the bilateral relationship competently, but she will work it within the rut. What might a Trump presidency look like for India-US relations? Most of what Trump has said about India, and about its neighbours, suggests that he would lift the Indo-US relationship out of its rut. In doing so, he could well take a good bilateral relationship and make it, as he himself would say, amazing. Indians might well ask, how can we expect an amazing relationship from a candidate who mimicked an Indian call centre worker in one of his campaign speeches? From a candidate who rails against outsourcing, and vows to right trade imbalances of the sort that India currently enjoys with the US? China's Loss If Trump wins in November, it will be because he will have, in turn, disrupted the Presidential Primary System (through a hostile takeover of the Republican Party) and the general election map (by wresting Rust Belt states from the electoral grip of the Democratic Party). As president, he could well disrupt the balance of power in Asia, shifting it in favour of India. China and Pakistan have been using the US as a cash cow for decades: China by running a huge trade surplus ($366 billion in 2015); Pakistan by playing a double game, soaking up US aid (more than $30 billion since 2002), while pretending to fight radical Islam. All signs indicate that Trump, if elected, would cut down on the flow of cash to both countries. The US has lost five million manufacturing jobs over the past 15 years, while China has seen rapid growth in its manufacturing sector over the same period. A President Trump will be electorally committed to bringing a material number of lost manufacturing jobs back to the US; the only way he can do so will be to offset Asia's (especially China's) labour cost advantage in manufacturing with a combination of tariff and non-tariff barriers. Such a move, in, say, early 2017, would come at the worst possible time for China, when a decades-long credit-fuelled investment boom may finally be turning to bust. For China, the potential outcomes of a trade war with the US range from sharply slower growth (best case scenario) to outright recession, which in turn could spark political unrest and, in a worst case scenario, revolution. Would India lose some technology and outsourcing jobs if a Trump Administration abandons US free trade policies? Perhaps, though it is harder to slap a tariff on a piece of code coming over the internet from Hyderabad than on a piece of machinery coming over the ocean from Shanghai. Regardless, in the zerosum great game of Asian powers, China's loss is India's gain. And China stands to lose big under a President Trump. Check on Pakistan Pakistan, India's other troublesome neighbour, is also set to be a big loser in a postelection shake-up of US relations in Asia. Trump has called Pakistan "probably the most dangerous [country]" and has said that "you have to get India involved; India is the check to Pakistan... I would start talking at that level very very quickly". This statement is a sharp reversal of tone from presidential candidates toward India-Pakistan relationship. Just eight years ago presidential candidate Barack Obama was hinting at the US mediating in Kashmir. Since then, as president, he has avoided talk of mediation and stuck to the long-standing Washington script of simply encouraging the two sides to "improve their bilateral relations". Now, however, the man who could be Obama's successor is tossing out that script and saying, in effect, Pakistan is a problem, and India is part of the solution to that problem: a profound humiliation for Islamabad. A President Trump would be more likely than any of his recent predecessors to try to influence Pakistan's policy by threatening to cut off US aid. Trump implied as much when commenting on the case of Dr Shakil Afridi, who infuriated Pakistan's government for allegedly helping the CIA definitively locate Osama bin Laden in 2011; Afridi has languished in a Pakistan jail ever since. "I think I would get him out in two minutes. I would tell them, 'let him out' and I'm sure they'd let him out, because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan," said Trump. London bookmakers have the odds of Trump winning in November at 5 to 2, shortened from 6 to 1 just over a month ago. The prospect of a Trump Presidency is certain be to rattling nerves among the generals of Rawalpindi and the Communist Party leaders of Beijing. For the same reasons, it should have the inhabitants of South Block grinning with anticipation. (The writer is a former US diplomat)</text>

	<text>KATHMANDU: Some 30 climbers have developed frostbite or become sick near the summit of Mount Everest, a mountaineering official said Sunday, after two deaths from apparent altitude sickness in recent days highlighted the risks on the world's highest mountain. Most of the sick climbers suffered frostbite while attempting to reach the summit or on their descent, Mountaineering Department official Gyanendra Shrestha said. Favorable weather has allowed nearly 400 climbers to reach the summit from Nepal since May 11, but the altitude, weather and harsh terrain can cause problems at any time. Several Sherpa guides carried one sick climber from the highest camp, at nearly 8,000 meters, to camp two, at 6,400 meters, where attempts are being made to pick her up with a helicopter, said Pemba Sherpa of the Seven Summit Treks agency in Kathmandu. Seema Goshwami of India had frostbite to her hands and feet at the South Col camp and was unable to move. "It took a big and risky effort but we were able to save her,'' Sherpa said, adding that an Iranian climber identified only as S. Hadi had been brought to Kathmandu and was recovering in a hospital. A Norwegian woman, 45-year-old Siv Harstad, suffered snow blindness and was helped down from the summit Saturday, the Norwegian news agency NTB said. The two climbers who died were on the same expedition team. It was undecided when and if their bodies would be brought down from the high altitude and it would depend on the team and family members, Pasang Phurba of the Seven Summits agency said. Carrying bodies down Everest takes at least eight Sherpas since they become frozen and heavier than normal. More details were not available because of communication difficulties on the 8,850-meter mountain. The two deaths were the first confirmed this year on Everest, during a busy climbing season that follows two years in which the peak was virtually empty due to two fatal avalanches. Eric Arnold, 35, had enough bottled oxygen with him, as well as climbing partners, but he complained of getting weak and died Friday night near South Col before he was able to get to a lower altitude, Phurba said. Just hours after Arnold died, Australian climber Maria Strydom also showed signs of altitude sickness Saturday afternoon before she died, Phurba said. Strydom was a finance lecturer at Monash University's business school in Melbourne. The school posted on Facebook that the community was deeply saddened by her death. Arnold was from Rotterdam, according to his Twitter account, which was updated on Friday with a post that he had reached the summit on his fifth try. In an interview earlier this year with RTV Rijnmond, Arnold noted that the risks of climbing the world's highest peak did not end at the summit. "Two-thirds of the accidents happen on the way down,'' he said. "If you get euphoric and think 'I have reached my goal,' the most dangerous part is still ahead of you.'' Strydom and her husband were attempting to climb the seven summits, the highest peaks on the seven continents, according to the Monash Business School's website. She had already climbed Denali in Alaska, Aconcagua in Argentina, Mount Ararat in Turkey and Kilamanjaro in Kenya, the website said. Strydom said she felt well-prepared for her attempt to climb Everest, and that depending on whether she reached the summit, her mind would likely turn to her next adventure. Thousands of people have summited Mount Everest since it was first conquered by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953. But more than 250 people have died in the attempt. Trekking companies were anxious to see foreign climbers return after two years of disasters. The devastating earthquake last year caused the season to be canceled, and climbing attempts were largely abandoned in 2014 after an avalanche above the base camp killed 16 Sherpa guides.</text>

	<text>SRINAGAR: Internet services were suspended in Kupwara district of Kashmir on Sunday as authorities apprehended misuse of social media in the wake of killing of five militants in an encounter on Saturday over which there have been protests by some locals. "The internet services in the (Kupwara) district have been suspended since midnight as a precautionary measure," a police official said. He said the step was taken to prevent elements inimical to peace from using the killing of the militants for fuelling anti-state protests. Five militants were killed on Saturday in an encounter with security forces in Kupwara district of north Kashmir that also left two soldiers injured. One of them succumbed to injuries on Sunday. The militants killed in the encounter on Saturday were laid to rest on Sunday in a local graveyard where hundreds of local residents participated in their last rites. After the funeral, some local residents staged protests, the official said adding the situation so far was under control.</text>

	<text>TEHRAN: Ahead of his maiden visit to energy-rich Iran, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said enhancing connectivity, trade, investment and energy partnership will be his priority with the post-sanction Persian Gulf nation. Modi, who arrives here this evening, will hold talks with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and its President Hassan Rouhani to boost bilateral trade, energy and strategic ties. "Enhancing connectivity, trade, investments, energy partnership, culture and people to people contacts would be our priority," he said in a series of tweets. After arrival here, he is scheduled to visit a local gurudwara. Modi said that his meetings with Rouhani and the supreme leader of Iran would provide an opportunity to advance "our strategic partnership". Rouhani will be hosting a lunch for him. "My meetings with President Rouhani and Hon'ble supreme leader of Iran will provide an opportunity to advance our strategic partnership," he said. Noting that he looked forward to the conclusion of the Chahbahar Agreement during his visit, the Prime Minister said, "India and Iran enjoy civilisational ties and have shared interest in the peace, security, stability and prosperity of the region." Chabahar is a port in South-East Iran that will enable India to bypass Pakistan and open up a route to land-locked Afghanistan with which New Delhi has close security ties and economic interests. From Chabahar, the existing Iranian road network can link up to Zaranj in Afghanistan, about 883 kms from the port. The Zaranj-Delaram road constructed by India in 2009 can give access to Afghanistan's Garland Highway, setting up road access to four major cities in Afghanistan Herat, Kandahar, Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif. Besides visiting the gurudwara, Modi will also inaugurate an International Conference on 'Retrospect and Prospect' of India-Iran relations. "I am looking forward to my visit to Iran today &amp; tomorrow, at the invitation of President Rouhani," he added. Besides signing a deal on development of Chabahar port, India is looking at doubling oil imports from Iran which a few years back was its second-biggest oil supplier, as well as getting rights to develop a giant gas field. Post-sanctions Iran has seen a flurry of diplomatic and business activity with leaders from China and Russia courting Tehran. Earlier, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had visited Tehran.</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: Aniruddha Voruganti of National Public School (NPS), Koramangala, who has secured 97.2% (486) in CBSE class XII exams, not only knows what he wants to do next, but has also already prepared the roadmap. The highest scorer in the science stream in his school has cleared four stages of interview to pursue medicine at Oxford University from October. He is one among six international students selected for the course in Oxford. But before that, he is happy that he would be able to commit six months to his dream project: Towards A Green Education (TAGE), an organisation that aims to provide free notebooks and stationery to underprivileged rural children and help spread the message of `save paper and reduce its wastage'. "I am glad I would be able to spend time on TAGE. We collect recyclable papers from schools and communities and use the funds generated from its recycling to buy stationery for needy children. We remove blank sheets from our old note books and students of my school bind them into new sets of notebooks for these children," said Aniruddha who is also a guitarist and a table tennis player. He added: "During the past two years, TAGE collected over 6,000 kg of used paper, about 150,000 sheets of blank paper, and made 800 handmade notebooks. TAGE has adopted six government schools in collaboration with Akshara Foundation, and has distributed over 450 stationery sets." Similarly, Gaurang Sriraman of NPS Indiranagar, who has secured 97.4%, is all set to join the Indian Institute of Science as he prefers pure science to engineering. Gaurang, the highest scorer in his school, said, "Our teachers were extremely helpful and would often clear our doubts even through WhatsApp. I qualified for Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana in Class XI with a rank of 222. I have already received the admission letter from IISc. I am into coding and our team won the HP code wars this year." Another student who has scored 97.4% like him is Mehak Arora of NPS Rajajinagar. Mehak says she wants to do computer science engineering from NIT. Meanwhile, Vishnu N Kaushik, of Delhi Public School (DPS), East, who secured 96.6% is now spending his last days in Bengaluru with friends and family as he has secured a seat for aerospace engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. He will leave for the US in August. "I am glad that I will study my favourite subject in Georgia and will carry my basketball and violin. I used to play the violin to stay calm during exams," he said. Aishwariya MR, commerce topper from DPS North with 95.2%, Ridhi Joshi, Humanities topper from the same school with 94.6%, and Mayank Jain, Commerce topper from DPS-East, are all set to pursue law. While Aishwariya will soon begin her law classes in MS Ramaiah Institute of Law, Ridhi and Mayank are waiting for the law entrance exam results. While Sanjana B Acharya, the highest humanities scorer from DPS-East with 94.6%, is preparing to study developmental science and work for the society, Prerna Hiriyiur of Sri Kumarans Children's Home, who secured 98.6% in commerce, wants to higher studies in economics.</text>

"Looking forward to congratulating Mamata-di personally during her swearing-in ceremony in Kolkata," Tobgay tweeted. In her reply, Banerjee expressed gratitude to him and tweeted, "Thank you so much for the kind words". The two leaders have developed a good rapport ever since Banerjee went to the Himalayan nation in 2015 where Tobgay even drove her once to the hotel in Thimphu. West Bengal shares over 180km long border with Bhutan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Akhilesh Yadav are also likely to be invited to the ceremony.</text>

	<text>BHUBANESWAR: It is 'politically difficult' to speed up structural reforms in India, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Saturday, even as he stressed on the need for cleansing the banks and checking inflation to ensure faster growth. Rajan also said labour market reforms can boost growth, but the process may draw opposition. Delivering a lecture on 'The Global Economy and India' here last night, the former Chief Economist of IMF said new rules need to be evolved for international monetary policy and called for the emerging markets like India to "speak up and raise their voice louder" to have a say in setting the global agenda. The Governor said India is fairly safe from volatile global economy and it has posted 7.5 per cent growth despite two droughts and weak international market. "Despite two droughts and weak international market scenario, we are registering about 7.5 per cent growth because of macro level stability," he said. While there is a need to ensure macro level stabilisation, the country would have to keep inflation under control and cleanse the banks, he said. "This can strengthen macro level stability," he said. In addition to that, maintaining reforms would attract both international and domestic investors and spur activities, Rajan said. Stating that structural reforms are important for elevating the potential of economy, the RBI Governor said degree of competition and level of participation of different segments of society should be raised in order to bring more and more people into the workforce. However, it may be difficult politically to speed up structural reforms and while labour market reforms can boost growth, the process may draw opposition, the outspoken Governor said. Describing a good policy as the first line of defence for the economy, he said in order to ensure safe borrowings, the country should try to opt for long-term borrowings instead of short-term ones. On the need for intervention in the realm of exchange rate to reduce volatility, Rajan said the country's foreign exchange reserve has gone up to USD 360 billion, which can also be described as a strong line of defence for Indian economy in the context of adverse global scenario. "We are now fairly safe against global volatility, provided we continue maintaining this policy," he said, adding that Indian economy is not as vulnerable now as it was in 2013. Stating that there may be uncertainties because of the policies of other countries and volatile international market, he said India, which remains largely protected and vigilant, should focus on building a strong policy. On evolving new rules of the game for international monetary policy, Rajan said emerging markets should try to present their ideas on different issues, like getting more IMF quota, before international fora. Stating that there should be a more responsible global monetary policy that follows rules of the game, he said a number of countries are now blaming each other over adoption of aggressive policies. All have domestic mandate as they have to worry about several things like ensuring growth and keeping inflation rate under control, he said. Referring to "helicopter money", Rajan said it can always push inflation and maintained that easy money can never provide answer to any problem. He said contrary to general belief, experiences in some countries show that low interest rates lead to high savings instead of pushing investment.</text>

	<text>LUDHIANA: The free bicycle scheme for government and aided high school students of Karnataka might run into trouble as the tender for purchase of 5.19 Lakh bicycles for school children might hit a roadblock, because industrialists from Ludhiana are gearing up to file a public interest litigation (PIL) against the tender on account of lax eligibility norms. The tender which was floated in month of January this year and was scheduled to be awarded by 18th March has got delayed by well over two months already and now the financial bids are scheduled to be opened on 23th May which otherwise were to be opened in March, the process could further be derailed if the PIL is admitted in the court. According to Raj Kumar Singla, General Secretary of federation of Punjab small industries association (FOPSIA) , "relaxation in eligibility criteria of the tender according to which ability to supply the entire tender quantity is not a pre-requisite anymore will now see the tender being split up among several bidders, which might lead to supply of different quality of the bicycles and there is also a probability that there will be delays in supply of the bicycles in the stipulated time period. We will file a PIL against this tender and question the lax eligibility criteria and there is also the need of questioning and comparing the prices at which the bidders have submitted their bids because there have been instances in the past when some of the cycle manufacturers have been found supplying same products at huge price difference to other state governments" According to sources the major bicycles players who initially participated in the pre-bid meet of this tender might pull out of the race as they also are not satisfied with the terms and conditions of the tender process and they even might stay away from Karnataka in the future as well.</text>

	<text>SYDNEY: A teenager was arrested on Tuesday after Australian police alleged he had been planning to launch a terrorist attack in SYDNEY. The 18-year-old was expected to be charged with planning a terrorist attack, the Australian federal police said. They said another charge  preparing to enter a foreign country to engage in hostile activities  was expected to be filed in connection with an earlier attempt by the teen to travel to Syria. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. "The planning was occurring now and we would say that an attack was probably imminent," New South Wales police deputy commissioner Catherine Burn told reporters. The teen had been making arrangements to get a firearm, Australian federal police acting deputy commissioner Neil Gaughan said. Officials believe he was working alone, and his arrest means there is no longer any threat to public safety linked to the alleged plot, Gaughan said. Burn and Gaughan declined to give details of what the teen's alleged plans involved, including what sites were the proposed targets. The teen, who had been on authorities' radar since last year, was stopped at Sydney airport in February when he attempted to travel to Syria, Gaughan said. His passport had been canceled and he was prevented from leaving the country. Since then, the teen had been under police surveillance, attorney-general George Brandis told reporters. Australia's government raised the country's terror threat level in 2014 in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. Police have since conducted dozens of raids they say have been aimed at thwarting multiple terror plots around Australia, including an alleged plan to attack government buildings and a naval base in Sydney. Many of those arrested have been teenagers, including a 16-year-old who was charged with plotting a terrorist attack on an Australian Veteran's Day ceremony in April. "We are still seeing people planning and preparing for such attacks and unfortunately, that group of people are getting younger and younger," Burn said.</text>

	<text>TAIPEI: Tsai Ing-wen was sworn in as Taiwan's first woman president on Friday, with the export-driven economy on the ropes and wary Communist Party rulers in China watching for any move towards independence by an island it considers its own. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won parliamentary and presidential elections by a landslide in January on voter backlash against creeping dependence on China. The DPP, which has traditionally favoured independence from China, takes over after eight years under China-friendly Nationalist Ma Ying-jeou. Wearing a cream blazer with dark trousers, Tsai pledged to defend the country and abide by the constitution of the Republic of China, Taiwan's formal name, as she took the oath of office, which was carried on live TV broadcast. "The favourable interaction will be broken," said Chang An-lo, a pro-unification leader, rallying about 400 supporters outside the DPP headquarters this week. Taiwan's main index was up a bit in cautious trade ahead of her speech. It slid to over three month lows last week with foreign investors net selling shares this month so far on political and economic worries. The trade-reliant economy, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, is struggling to shake off last year's recession as prolonged weakness in global demand weighs on Asian exporters. China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. It is deeply distrustful of the DPP, whose charter includes a clause promoting "a sovereign and independent Republic of Taiwan". Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communists in China in 1949. China has pressured the new Taiwan government to stick to the "one-China" principle agreed with the Nationalists. That allows each side to interpret what "one China" means. The Communists say they rule all of China including Taiwan, while the Nationalists maintain Taipei is the ruler. Tsai has said she will maintain the status quo, but stops short of referring to "one China". During the inauguration ceremony, performers will pay tribute to demonstrations that have been key to the DPP's rise, including the 2014 Sunflower Movement protests. The DPP is distrustful of growing economic dependence on China and champions Taiwan's own history. Tsai, partly of aboriginal descent, will take the stage in front of the presidential office, a life-size replica of which Taiwan has said has been built in China and used for attack practice. "We have emphasized ... our hope that both sides will continue to show flexibility going forward in the name of maintaining peace and stability," said Daniel Kritenbrink, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House's National Security Council, earlier this week. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but is also Taiwan's biggest ally and arms supplier.</text>

	<text>An Australian law firm has filed a compensation claim against Russia and President Vladimir Putin in the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of families of victims of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, shot down in 2014, media reported. The jetliner crashed in Ukraine in pro-Russian rebel-held territory on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board, including 28 Australians. The aircraft, which was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, the Dutch Safety Board concluded in its final report late last year. Fighting was raging in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces when the aircraft was downed and many Western experts and governments blamed the rebels. Australia's Fairfax media reported on Saturday that 33 next of kin were of victims named in an application by Sydney law firm LHD Lawyers, representing people from Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. Reuters could not immediately reach LHD Lawyers for comment. The application was filed on May 9 and names the Russian Federation and Putin as respondents and seeks $10 million in compensation per passenger, the report said. The Dutch Safety Board, which was not empowered to address questions of responsibility, did not point the finger at any group or party for launching the missile.</text>

	<text>LAGOS (Nigeria): Nigerian soldiers have found one of the schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram from Chibok, making her the first freed from the Islamic extremists since the mass kidnapping more than two years ago. Her uncle describes her as pregnant and traumatized but otherwise fine. Amina Ali Nkeki is the first of the 219 Chibok girls to escape from her captors since their abduction grabbed worldwide attention more than two years ago. She was found wandering in the forest, uncle Yakubu Nkeki told Associated Press. He said the 19-year-old  she was 17 when she was abducted  was brought to Chibok Tuesday night for her identity to be verified and to be reunited with her mother. Her father died while she was held captive, he said. He said the soldiers then took the young woman away, apparently to a military camp in the town of Damboa. Other Chibok girls may also have been rescued by soldiers hunting down Boko Haram in the remote northeastern Sambisa Forest on Tuesday night, said Chibok community leader Pogu Bitrus. He said he is working with officials to establish their identities. Boko Haram Islamic extremists stormed and firebombed the Government Girls Secondary School at Chibok on April 14, 2014, and seized 276 girls who were preparing to write science exams. Dozens escaped in the first hours, but 219 remained missing. The inability of Nigeria's government and military to rescue them led, in part, to the electoral defeat of President Goodluck Jonathan last year. It's not known how many thousands of girls, boys and young women have been kidnapped by Boko Haram in a nearly 7-year-old insurgency that has killed some 20,000 people and spread across Nigeria's borders. Nigeria's military has reported freeing thousands this year as they have forced the extremists from towns and into strongholds in the sprawling Sambisa Forest. Boko Haram has turned to soft targets using suicide bombers.</text>

	<text>HAVANA: Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Bolivian President Evo Morales discussed "imperialist efforts" to undo leftist progress in Latin America during Morales' two-day visit to the Communist-ruled island, Cuban state television reported on Saturday. Two major powers in the region have moved to the right in recent months. Argentina's Peronists were voted out of office late last year while in Brazil, Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was suspended as president earlier this month due to impeachment. Leftist countries such as Cuba have called Rousseff's suspension a "coup" while the president of El Salvador went as far as to say he would not recognize the centrist interim government. Morales and Castro spoke "of the events happening in Latin America and the imperialist efforts to revert the political and social movement in our region," state television reported. No images of the encounter were shown. One of Cuba's closest allies is Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who is under fire over a deepening economic crisis is facing protests in favor of a recall referendum. Morales faced a setback earlier this year when he was defeated in a referendum that would have cleared the way for him to run for a fourth term in 2019. The Bolivian president met with Cuban President Raul Castro, younger brother of Fidel, on Friday and attended a ceremony during which government officials of both countries signed bilateral agreements on health, education, culture and the economy.</text>

	<text>TOKYO: A group representing Japanese survivors of US atomic bombings has asked US President Barack Obama to hear their stories and apologize when he visit Hiroshima . Two leaders of the Tokyo-based nationwide group said Thursday many survivors want an apology though they avoided an outright demand for one. US atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the World War II killed more than 200,000 people and nearly destroyed the cities. White House confirms Barack Obama visit to Hiroshima Obama will visit Hiroshima on May 27 after the Group of Seven summit in central Japan, becoming the first serving American president to do so. Washington said he won't apologize and a meeting with survivors is unlikely. That apparently prompted the survivors to remind him of their true feelings and expectations for his commitment to a nuclear-free world.</text>

	<text>COPENHAGEN: Female genital mutilation ( FGM ) will never end until men also throw their weight behind efforts to eradicate the potentially deadly practice, says Nigerian law student and anti-FGM activist Kelechukwu Nwachukwu. On the other side of Africa, Kenyan farmer and community worker Tony Mwebia agrees. "The main reason why girls in Kenya undergo FGM is to increase their marriageability. If men said no to FGM, trust me, families wouldn't get their girls cut ." Nwachukwu, who will speak on Tuesday at Women Deliver, a major women's health and rights conference in Copenhagen, said men are crucial to stopping FGM in Nigeria because it is a deeply patriarchal society. "It's almost impossible to end it without engaging men because they are the decision makers and gatekeepers in the community," he said. The global movement to end FGM has been galvanised by women activists across Africa who have risked death threats to speak out against a practice widely condemned as a serious human rights abuse. But now a small number of men are joining their ranks. In Kenya, there is even a Maasai cricket team that campaigns against FGM. An estimated 200 million girls and women worldwide have undergone FGM, which is practised in a swathe of African countries and pockets of the Middle East and Asia. The ritual involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia. In extreme cases, the vaginal opening is also sewn up. The reasons for carrying out FGM vary between communities, but a key factor is the belief that a woman's sexuality needs to be controlled. The ritual is often considered a prerequisite for marriage. However, the practice can cause serious physical and psychological problems, including potentially fatal complications during childbirth later in life. No one knows how many girls die from the cutting. "I've seen girls who have died, but the parents don't make the link. Many will tell you that it's just God's will," said Nwachukwu, 22, who co-chairs the Youth Network Against FGM in Nigeria. "Most men in Nigeria are quite naive about FGM and don't know what's involved. They support it because it's a cultural practice but they don't know there are very harmful effects." Nwachukwu said the horror of FGM was brought home to him five years ago when he was visiting a friend and heard a girl screaming. When he suggested going to help, his friend stopped him, telling him the girl was being initiated into womanhood. "It's prevalent in the community I come from so I decided to ask questions. I was worried because I hope to get married one day and have daughters and I don't want them to be cut," said Nwachukwu, who also works with The Girl Generation, a U.K.-funded programme to end FGM in 10 African countries. Mwebia's journey to activism started when he was working on a U.N. project in Nairobi with refugees from Somalia and Ethiopia, where FGM is widely practised. "I heard things I could not imagine," said the 28-year-old campaigner. "Men spoke about how they'd lost loved ones because of childbirth complications, mothers told me how their daughters had bled to death. Women also talked about the pain they suffered every time they had sex. "Their stories really moved me and I swore to try to end this cruelty." Mwebia, who is also attending Women Deliver, now works in the southwestern Kuria region where he said FGM remains almost universal despite Kenya outlawing the practice in 2011. Nigeria banned FGM last year and Nwachukwu said the new law should be a "wake-up call" for men to speak up. A quarter of women have been cut in Nigeria, where it is particularly prevalent in the south. Some see FGM as important for preserving a girl's virginity or for cleanliness. Others say it increases sexual pleasure for the man. The riutal is also perpetuated by myths. Some believe that when a woman gives birth the baby will die if the clitoris touches its head, and others say the clitoris will keep growing if it is not cut. But Nwachukwu said the main factor in Nigeria is social pressure. Girls who are not cut risk ostracisation, as do their mothers, he said. A striking feature about FGM in several countries is that women massively overestimate men's support for the practice. In Nigeria, two thirds of men want FGM to stop, but only half of women think men want it to stop, according to United Nations data. Campaigners who want to end FGM in a generation say it is vital to get young men on board. However, Nwachukwu and Mwebia admit their commitment to advocating on what is widely seen as a "women's issue" often raises eyebrows. "People ask, 'Why are you involved? Are you a feminist?'," said Nwachukwu. "I get comments every day, but I just give them the facts. I show them videos and pictures and they are shocked, and then they realise that this is a serious matter." he adds.</text>

	<text>UNITED NATIONS: A group of 51 Muslim states has blocked 11 gay and transgender organizations from attending a high-level meeting at the United Nations next month on ending AIDS, sparking a protest by the United States, Canada and the European Union. Egypt wrote to the president of the 193-member general assembly on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to object to the participation of the 11 groups. It did not give a reason in the letter, which Reuters saw. Samantha Power, US ambassador to the United Nations, wrote to general assembly president Mogens Lykketoft and said the groups appeared to have been blocked for involvement in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy. "Given that transgender people are 49 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population, their exclusion from the high-level meeting will only impede global progress in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic," Power wrote. UN officials said the European Union and Canada also wrote to Lykketoft to protest the objections by the OIC group, whose members include Saudi Arabia, Iran, Indonesia, Sudan and Uganda. The issues of LGBT rights and participation in events at the United Nations have long been contentious. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has advocated for LGBT equality but faced opposition from African, Arab and Muslim states as well as Russia and China. "We are deeply concerned that at every negotiation on a new general assembly gathering, the matter of NGO (non-governmental organization) participation is questioned and scrutinized," Power wrote. "The movement to block the participation of NGOs on spurious or hidden grounds is becoming epidemic and severely damages the credibility of the UN," she said. In 2014, Ban said the UN would recognize all same-sex marriages of its staff, allowing them to receive its benefits. Russia, with the support of 43 states including Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, India, Egypt, Pakistan, and Syria, unsuccessfully tried to overturn the move last year. In February, the 54-member African Group, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the 25-member Group of Friends of the Family led by Belarus, Egypt and Qatar protested six new UN stamps promoting LGBT equality. The Group of Friends of the Family promotes the traditional family. It launched a photo exhibit, "Uniting Nations for a Family Friendly World," at the UN on Tuesday, which is the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.</text>

	<text>FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA: Hundreds of workers at several small oil camps north of Canada's main oil sands city were ordered to evacuate on Monday due to a quickly spreading wildfire, and a precautionary evacuation is under way for several thousand more workers in the area. The evacuations are taking place as the oil industry attempts to ramp up production after the same wildfire ignited two weeks ago, forcing more than 80,000 residents to evacuate and destroying more than 2,400 structures in Fort McMurray. Firefighters managed to save essential infrastructure in the oil sands capital, including the hospital, water treatment plant and the airport. There are about 4,000 workers at 12 camps in the area, many of them at the large Suncor and Syncrude sites. The fire is 15 to 20 kilometers (9 to 13 miles) south of the Suncor and Syncrude sites. ``Those are not under mandatory evacuations at this time,'' Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said. ``They are engaging in precautionary evacuations of non-essential personnel. The fire has not yet moved that close to the facilities.'' Some workers are staying behind to conduct work on the plant and help with firefighting. Sneh Seetal, a spokesman for Suncor Energy, called it a ``precautionary measure.'' ``The facilities are not at risk,'' she said. ``However, we felt it was important to take these steps in the interest of putting people first.'' Officials say 500 to 600 workers at several small camps are under a mandatory evacuation order. Scott Long of the Alberta Management Agency said there is no panic and the evacuations are being conducted in an orderly manner. The Rural Municipality of Wood Buffalo said the fire is moving 30 to 40 meters (33 to 44 yards) per minute and is expected to burn six kilometers (3.7 miles) in two hours. Officials say thick smoke is also posing a hazard. Crews continued to battle hot spots on the edge of Fort McMurray onMonday while the first still raged out of control deeper in the forest. Hot, dry conditions were not helping firefighters. Earlier Monday, officials warned the air quality in the Fort McMurray area was dangerously poor. Notley said the air quality health index is normally one to 10, with 10 being the worst, but the reading on Monday morning was at 38. Notley said the conditions were hampering efforts to get residents back to their homes. ``Alberta Health Services has recommended that members of the public who had been previously arranging to return to the area under various requests not return until those conditions improve,'' Notley said at a news conference in Edmonton. ``This is something that could potentially delay recovery work and a return to the community.'' Karen Grimsrud, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said they expect the air quality readings to remain in the extreme range for the next couple of days. She said workers in the area should be wearing respirators.</text>

	<text>HARGEISA (Somalia): The semi-autonomous region of Somaliland is renewing calls for international recognition of its self-declared independence from Somalia. Somaliland on Wednesday celebrated 25 years since the region proclaimed independence from Somalia. Thousands of civilians and military personnel paraded in front of dignitaries in the capital Hargeisa as the government showed off its Soviet-era military arsenal. Somaliland asserted independence in 1991 after the overthrow of Somali dictator Siad Barre. The region has experienced relative stability and economic prosperity over the years, even though neighboring Somalia has been wracked by deadly violence. "We do not want any special treatment form the international community," said Sa'ad Ali Shire, Somaliland's foreign minister. "We simply want recognition of the reality that has existed in Somaliland for 25 years." The celebrations came as Somaliland's main port, Berbera, is set to receive a substantial amount of funding from the United Arab Emirates. The two countries signed a development contract on May 9 that includes the planned renovation of Berbera, which connects Somaliland to Ethiopia. The total deal is reportedly worth $400 million. Among those attending the celebrations Wednesday was Kenyan lawmaker Mohamed Shidiye, who told The Associated Press that for him "the (Somali) government in Mogadishu is clinically dead. It doesn't exist." "I'm here to celebrate together with the Somaliland people their achievements in the past 25 years and to call on the international community to recognize them," he said. Somaliland, with a population of approximately 4 million, has established its own government based in Hargeisa but it hasn't yet received any recognition from the international community. Previous efforts to mediate between Somalia and Somaliland by Turkey and Djibouti have failed, with officials in Hargeisa accusing mediators of favoring the Somali government, which is facing a deadly rebellion by the Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab.</text>

	<text>LA PAZ: Bolivia braved criticism from Christian churches to enact a gender identity law allowing transsexual and transgender people to change their name, sex and photo on official and private documents. "Today we've put an end to a history of social proscription," Vice President Alvaro Garcia yesterday said as he enacted the legislation in place of President Evo Morales , who was visiting Cuba. Transgender people "are a reality," he said. "It is social hypocrisy to deny their existence." Bolivia's legislature passed the law on Friday, despite protests from Catholic and Evangelical churches demanding more debate. The Catholic Church had said it rejected the text because it undermines family and societal "norms." An Evangelical church leader, pastor Sergio Gutierrez, had called for a national referendum on the issue. But Garcia yesterday pointed to an interview last year in which Pope Francis said transsexuals were also children of God and that they should be accepted by the Church as such. "If the pope says that, who are we to judge and to deny someone who wants to modify their sexual identity?" Garcia asked. LGBT associations welcomed the law. "We can see we are in a new state able to integrate each of these people who were vilified and who had no rights," said Tamara Nunez, a representative of a transsexual collective. "Identity is the first fundamental right."</text>

	<text>China's government fabricates about 488 million social media comments a year - nearly the same as one day of Twitter's total global volume - in a massive effort to distract its citizens from bad news and sensitive political debates, according to a study. Three scholars led by Gary King, a political scientist at Harvard University who specialises in using quantitative data to analyse public policy, ran the first systematic study of China's online propaganda workers, known as the Fifty Cent Party because they are popularly believed to be paid by the government 50 Chinese cents for every social media post. Contrary to popular perception inside China, the Fifty Cent Party avoids engaging in debates with critics and doesn't make fun of foreign governments. Instead, it mostly works to distract public attention away from hot topics by highlighting the positive, cheering the state, symbols of the regime, or the Communist Party's revolutionary past. Although those who post comments are often rumored to be ordinary citizens, the researchers were surprised to find that nearly all the posts were written by workers at government agencies including tax and human resource departments, and at courts. The team based their findings on leaked archives of 2013 and 2014 e-mails from the Internet Propaganda Office of Zhanggong, a county-level district of nearly half a million people in Ganzhou City, in Jiangxi, a province in southeast China King and his team pulled out 2,341 e-mails of which more than half contained a Fifty Cent post, totaling 43,797 posts that formed a benchmark for identifying other propaganda posts. They were able to identify Fifty Centers by cross referencing names from leaked e-mails with online social media profiles.</text>

	<text>MOSCOW: Russia has proposed to the US-led coalition that they stage joint airstrikes on Syrian rebels including Nusra Front who are not observing the ceasefire, starting on May 25, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday. Such action would be coordinated with the Syrian government, he told a Defence Ministry meeting broadcast on state television, adding that Moscow reserved the right to stage strikes unilaterally. Washington has consistently refused to join any operation that is coordinated with the Syrian government, as has been the case with Russia's campaign of airstrikes that began in September last year. Shoigu said joint airstrikes should also target convoys carrying weapons and ammunition crossing into Syria from Turkey. While Russia supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the United States - along with its allies in the West and the Gulf - back rebels trying to overthrow him. However, both sides oppose the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which was not included in a ceasefire deal which has failed to prevent widespread violence. Shoigu said the proposed joint airstrikes would help the stalled peace process. "We believe the adoption of these measures will allow a transition to a peaceful process to be achieved in the entire territory of Syria," he said. "Of course, these measures have been coordinated with the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic." Shoigu said discussions with U.S. military experts based in Jordan and other counterparts in Geneva had begun on Thursday. But he added: "We reserve the right to start from May 25 unilateral strikes on units of international terrorist groups and illegal armed groups which have not joined the ceasefire."</text>

	<text>LAGOS: Soldiers have found one of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram from a boarding school in Chibok town, her uncle said Wednesday, describing her as pregnant and traumatized but otherwise fine. Amina Ali Nkeki is the first of the 219 so-called Chibok girls to be freed since the mass abduction that grabbed attention around the world more than two years ago. Community leader Pogu Bitrus says other Chibok girls may also have been rescued by soldiers hunting down Boko Haram in the remote northeastern Sambisa Forest on Tuesday night. He said he was working with officials to establish their identity. Boko Haram Islamic extremists stormed and firebombed the Government Girls Secondary School at Chibok on April 14, 2014, and seized 276 girls who were preparing to write science exams. Dozens escaped within hours, but 219 remained missing. The inability of Nigeria's government and military to rescue them led, in part, to the electoral defeat of President Goodluck Jonathan last year. Yakubu Nkeki says his niece was found wandering in the forest. He says the 19-year-old (she was 17 when she was abducted) was brought to Chibok Tuesday night for her identity to be verified and reunited with her mother. But her father died while she was held captive, he said. He said the soldiers then took the young woman away, apparently to a military camp in the town of Damboa. It's not known how many thousands of girls, boys and young women have been kidnapped by Boko Haram in a nearly 7-year-old insurgency that has killed some 20,000 people and spread across Nigeria's borders. Nigeria's military has reported freeing thousands this year as they have forced the extremists from towns and into strongholds in the sprawling Sambisa Forest. Boko Haram has turned to soft targets using suicide bombers.</text>

	<text>BANGKOK: Thailand called for speeding up of free-trade talks with India and said the key details of the long-awaited pact should be settled first, leaving minor contentious issues for later discussions. Commerce minister Apiradi Tantraporn, who held talks with India's ambassador to Thailand Bhagwant Singh Bishnoi on Tuesday, said, "The Thai side first wants to settle key details of the long-awaited free-trade pact, leaving minor contentious issues for later discussion." She said both the countries have agreed to accelerate the completion of the Thai-India free trade agreement ( FTA ) after implementing the Early Harvest Programme back in 2004, which covered 82 items. "With disagreement on some topics, Thailand thinks both countries should finalise the agreement in some parts and continue negotiating on the remaining topics," she said. The minister further said that Thai firms are keen to join India's Make in India, Smart Cities and Economic Corridor schemes as they see greater business opportunities amid the strong growth of the Indian economy. Thailand and India signed a framework agreement covering the liberalisation of trade in goods, services and investment on October 9, 2003. It was agreed that they would begin talks and establish a FTA by 2010. Both the countries initially agreed to enact an early harvest scheme (EHS), which meant agreements on one or more topics must be concluded before the scheduled completion of a multi-issue round. The agreement specified tariff reductions under the EHS for 82 items, including fruits, processed food products, gems and jewelery, iron and steel products, auto parts, electronic goods and electric appliances. Tariffs on these products were eliminated on Sept 1, 2006. India and Thailand have also agreed to support the Asean-India FTA and the negotiation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership by this year. Sources said Asean-India FTA had in some ways overtaken the India-Thailand FTA. India feels Bangkok should be responsive to its demands in the FTA in services sector, sources added. India is Thailand's 15th-biggest trading partner and the largest in South Asia. Over the last five years, the annual two-way trade averaged $8.47 billion. In 2015, two-way trade reached $7.92 billion, which was 1.9 per cent of Thailand's exports. Thailand enjoyed a trade surplus of $2.67 billion with India last year.</text>

	<text>BRASILIA: Street protests and controversy over the absence of female ministers clouded Brazilian acting President Michel Temer's political honeymoon on Monday as he began his first full week in power. Temer took over from president Dilma Rousseff last week after the Senate voted to open an impeachment trial on charges that she illegally manipulated the budget. The 75-year-old center-right leader has vowed to reverse Rousseff's leftist course in an attempt to haul Brazil back from its deepest recession in decades. Although a cabinet, which will be reduced from a bloated 32 ministries to 23, has already been named, there was a delay to the nomination in the key post of central bank head. New Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles , whose early pronouncements are being carefully watched by the markets, had been due to announce the nominee Monday but put it off for a day, Brazilian newspapers reported. In a television interview late Sunday, Temer vowed to unite Brazil after months of increasingly divisive debate over the impeachment of Rousseff, who accuses Temer of leading a coup. "Unification of the country means unifying political parties, employers and workers, and making a joint effort in Brazilian society so that we can get out of the crisis we find ourselves in," he said on Globo television. But just days into the job, Temer finds himself under steady attack from the left. Jeering and pot banging could be heard in parts of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during his television interview, a form of protest that used to dog Rousseff to the point where she began avoiding broadcast appearances. Street protests also took place Sunday in several cities, including the capital Brasilia and the financial center Sao Paulo. Another was held Monday in Rio de Janeiro, which hosts the Olympics in less than three months. Activists occupied offices of the education and culture ministries, which are being merged under Temer's plan. Although the scale of opposition demonstrations is so far modest, Rousseff's fight against impeachment in the Senate trial, which could take as long as six months, means that Temer will have trouble settling in. "The popular reaction to the coup continues and the protests should continue," Rui Falcao, president of Rousseff's Workers' Party, said on Monday. Polls show Temer is almost as unpopular as Rousseff. His naming of a cabinet comprised entirely of white men has put him on the defensive. In his Sunday interview he looked to sidestep the controversy, insisting that women would be given powerful posts, although not at ministerial level. But his reference to women as "representatives of the feminine world" prompted derision on opposition social media. Another hurdle facing Temer is to make good on his promise to cut costs and streamline the overburdened state budget. He has promised to slash up to 5,000 civil service jobs and says that he, unlike Rousseff, is in a position to deal with Congress over unpopular budget reductions. Temer was due to meet Monday with the main unions to discuss social security reforms. But one of the biggest groups, the CUT, boycotted the session. A constitutional lawyer who was Rousseff's vice president thanks to an uneasy coalition between his PMDB party and the Workers' Party, Temer says he feels free to act in the interests of the country because he likely won't seek election in the scheduled 2018 presidential vote. "I realize I don't have popular backing," he said. But "I don't have to make gestures or do things leading to an eventual reelection. I can even be, let's say, unpopular, because as long as I produce benefits for the country that's enough for me."</text>

	<text>CAIRO: Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Sunday that no theory was being favoured on why the EgyptAir MS804 plunged into the Mediterranean Sea and that Egypt was using a submarine to locate the black boxes. The Airbus A320 carrying 66 people had crashed into the sea while flying from Paris to Cairo early on Thursday, and some wreckage has been found. However, the black boxes are still missing. Egypt's aviation minister had said that terrorism was a more likely reason than technical failure, but Sisi said in a televised address that "all the theories are possible". He added, "There is no particular theory we can affirm right now." Sisi said a submarine that could operate at a depth of 9,800 feet under sea level had been deployed on Sunday to search for the black boxes. "This (submarine) moved today in the direction of the plane crash because we are working hard to retrieve the two boxes, which are the black boxes," he said. A civil aviation official had on Sunday said that search teams had found none of the passengers' bodies.</text>

	<text>CARACAS: Called "mad as a goat" by Uruguay's Jose Mujica this week, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro retorted laughingly on Thursday that the former president was right - but he was only crazy with love for his country. "Yes, I'm mad as a goat, it's true," Maduro told a rally of the ruling Socialist Party. "I'm mad with love for Venezuela, for the Bolivarian Revolution, for Chavez and his example," he added, smiling as the crowd cheered, in a reference to former President Hugo Chavez. Mujica, a fellow leftist who ruled Uruguay between 2010 and 2015, said on Wednesday he respected Maduro, but still thought he and others in Venezuela were "crazy" for attacking each other rather than sitting down to resolve problems. Amid a deep economic crisis, Venezuela's opposition is pushing for a recall referendum to oust Maduro. Government officials say that will not happen this year, and security forces have been blocking protest marches demanding the vote. Numerous foreign countries are calling for dialogue, but there is deep hostility and suspicion between Maduro's government and the opposition Democratic Unity coalition.</text>

	<text>JOHANNESBURG: Some 750 South African families who say they were pushed out of their land on a natural reserve during apartheid will be handed over $5 million in compensation, President Jacob Zuma said on Saturday. "We have come together about land, to restore the rights of our people who were dispossessed," Zuma said in Kruger, South Africa's largest natural reserve. "Today we are contributing to the reversal of the apartheid legacy by compensating six communities, three from Limpopo, and another three from Mpumalanga, all who were dispossessed through harsh apartheid laws," he added. "We are awarding a total amount of 84 million rand ($5.4 million, 4.8 million euros) to six communities," Zuma said. The 757 families who make up the six communities are the descendants of people expelled starting from the year 1930. While apartheid officially started in 1948, racial segregation began earlier. They will be the first group to receive compensation on their claims on the Kruger national park, Zuma said. "We celebrate this milestone in the history of Land Restitution in our country," he said. The government has decided to compensate the families rather than return their land because Kruger is now a major natural reserve. Since the end of apartheid rule in 1994, 3.3 million hectares (8.2 million acres) of land have been restituted to 1.9 million people, Nomfundo Ntloko-Gobodo, an official at the agriculture ministry, told AFP. Many white South African farmers fear that the country may take the path of Zimbabwe, where the state-sanctioned seizure of white-owned farmland starting in 2000 left the agricultural sector in ruin.</text>

	<text>MANILA: Presumptive Philippine President-elect Rodrigo Duterte said Monday he will re-impose the death penalty, offer Cabinet posts to communist rebels, and move to amend the constitution to give more power to the provinces, in some of his first policy pronouncements since winning last week's election based on an unofficial count. In his first nationally televised news conference since the May 9 vote, Duterte also said he will launch a major military offensive to destroy Abu Sayyaf extremists on southern Jolo Island. The announcements, a sharp departure from current government policy, reflect his brash campaign pledge to end crime and corruption in the impoverished nation in three to six months. Police officials have said the plan is undoable, and that crime remains prevalent in Davao city, where Duterte has served as mayor for more than 22 years. The military has been fighting a decades-long Marxist insurgency in the countryside. Duterte said he would likely offer the Cabinet posts of environment and natural resources, agrarian reform, social welfare, and labor to the communist rebels. "They are the most vigilant group in the Philippines about labor so they would get it," Duterte said. The move would likely be strongly opposed by big business and industry. Duterte said he would ask Congress to re-impose the death penalty, which has been suspended since 2006 in the face of staunch opposition from the dominant Roman Catholic Church. Capital punishment by hanging, he said, should be imposed for heinous crimes, and criminals convicted of killing along with robbery and rape should be meted "double the hanging." "After the first hanging, there will be another ceremony for the second time until the head is completely severed from the body," he said. Commission on Human Rights Chairman Chito Gascon said his agency opposes the death penalty and would block any attempt to re-impose it, adding that the constitution forbids cruel and degrading punishments like hanging. "In a country where the rule of law has so many loopholes and problems, what will happen is the possibility of a mistaken conviction," Gascon said by telephone. Duterte also plans to switch to a federal form of government, aiming to give more power and resources to regions, including the country's south, where Davao city is located. Such a change would require an amendment to the constitution. In a populist move, Duterte said he would sell the presidential yacht and use the money to buy medical equipment for military and police personnel. "When people are hungry and jobless ...it would be an obscene thing" to have the luxury vessel lying unused, he said. TV network ABS-CBN also quoted him as telling reporters in Davao late Sunday that he plans to ban the use of luxury cars among his Cabinet members and will use his personal pickup truck as his official presidential vehicle. Duterte reiterated on Monday his vow to control illegal drugs and crime, even if it means losing the presidency or his life. "Stop messing with me, because I have a sacred promise to save the next generation from the evil of drugs," he told critics. He also promised to cut government red tape and remove corrupt officials. Duterte said "contaminated" police generals facing corruption cases should "get out now" before he assumes office. If not, they should prepare to be sent to invade the Abu Sayyaf militants, who have been blamed for multiple kidnappings and beheadings. "And if you are taken hostage there, say your `Our Fathers' because I will never, never pay anything to retrieve you," he added. Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Visaya, whom Duterte is considering to head the military, said he met over the weekend with the mayor, who told him he wanted troops to finish off the Abu Sayyaf within the president's six-year term and to back up the police in going after drug syndicates. After the news conference, Duterte met with the ambassadors of China, Japan and Israel. Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua gave him a book of writings by Chinese President Xi Jinping.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Muslim leaders have dismissed Islamic State's latest propaganda video focused on India as a can of lies aimed at disrupting social harmony in India. "If you have friends like Islamic State, who needs enemies?" said senior community leader Ghulam Peshimam, elaborating that Islamic State is the worst enemy of Muslims."They can't win over Indian Muslims till India has vibrant democracy, secularism and a fair justice system. Yes, polarization of Indian society may create a fertile ground for IS to find some traction here," he said. Muslim leaders unequivo cally denounced the IS which, through the video, attacks some Muslim politicians and clerics for creating an alliance with "kafirs (infidels)". "Indian Muslims reject terrorism of Islamic State. We don't need any advocacy from a violent group like Daesh or ISIS," said All India United Democratic Front leader Badruddin Ajmal whose photograph has been juxtaposed with picture of riot victims in the video. "The fact that we have voting rights here and enjoy religious freedom speaks volumes. Indian Muslims will not get attracted by ISIS propaganda. " Pervez Lakdawala of Indian Union Muslim League said IS cannot be sympathetic to Muslims as it represents a medieval mindset. Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan said, "Islam is a religion of peace. What ISIS does is unIslamic and inhuman. Indian Muslim youths will not fall in their trap. The video is perhaps issued to lure more youths from India that fortunately has not provided them many recruits."</text>

	<text>Juli and Shingo Sarkar, a pair of fraternal twins who studied at Mumbai's R N Podar School, managed to get an identical score of 95% in their Class XII CBSE results announced on Saturday. They scored an identical 475 and got 95 each in Physics and Chemistry. The twins of mixed origin - born to a Japanese mother and a Bengali father - have been in Mumbai throughout their schooling. Juli said, "We were adamant about not attending tuition or coaching. We studied on our own with help from our school and teachers. It was fun for us because we could study together and quiz each other. There was always a healthy competition between us. I believe time management is very important." She added that the siblings would also devote adequate time other activities. Both are state-level athletes and have also participated in several dance competitions. Shingo said, "Since Juli and I had different strengths and weaknesses, we would often help each other. My parents have also always supported us. My mother, Kazumi Sarkar, who teaches Japanese at IIT-Bombay took a break this year to help us." Their father, Arup, is a business consultant. The twins now plan to head to Japan. While Shingo has got into Chemical Engineering at Nagoya University, Juli will study Environmental Science in University of Tokyo.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: In what could be another blot on the reputation of the 159-year-old Mumbai University , eight employees were caught by Bhandup police on Friday for sneaking answer sheets of first-year engineering students out of the examination house. The answer sheets were given to a few students who took them home, wrote the answers and returned them to these officials. The eight accused were caught while trying to place the answer sheets back. They were found to be in possession of at least 92 answer sheets of Applied Mathematics - an exam conducted on May 11. Those arrested include custodian (havaldar in university's hierarchy) of the answer sheets Prabhakar Vaze (50), three clerks on contract and four peons hired on contract. Bhandup police received a tip-off about the scam last week and acted promptly. The accused had planned to put all papers back in place by Friday as they were to be scanned on Saturday for evaluation. Most of the seized papers were from exam centres in Kamothe, Khargar, Airoli and Karjat. "We first zeroed in on Manoj Shingade, 22, a commerce student, who acted as a middleman for his friend. On Friday we got information that Shingade was coming to Bhandup station to hand over an answer sheet to a man. We nabbed him around 7am. He revealed that a university peon, Mithun More, helped him get the paper. We nabbed More too," said sub-inspector Shivshankar Bhosale of the Bhandup police who is investigating the case. The answer sheet recovered from Shingade contained serial number 506981228 and QP code 528704, besides the candidate's seat number, 11200349. Police suspect that page numbers three to 27 were written with a different pen. "We will sending the papers for forensic test too," said an officer. More said seven more people were involved and Vaze was the kingpin. "When we went to nab Vaze he was drinking beer outside a country liquor shop near the Kalina campus. We searched the bag with him and found 35 answer sheets of Applied Mathematics. We later took custody of all the accused and by then had seized 92 answer sheets," added a cop. Interestingly, the accused tried to prevent arrest citing a court order stating police had to make inquiries before arrest. "We had evidence and the papers were found in their possession. We nabbed the agents, statements of witnesses and hence we arrested them," said an officer. A team led by senior police inspector Shripad Kale had conducted the operation and informed university officials about the police action. DCP Sangramsingh Nishandar said they were probing if more people were involved. Mumbai University's in-charge examination controller said MU will act on the police complaint and call for an urgent meeting on Monday to decide the future course of action against the employees. Another university official said engineering answer sheets are assessed online. Though papers are to be scanned within two to three days of the exam, it is at times delayed as there are only three to four scanning machines. "The papers are then kept longer in the store room," said an official. "We do not know at what stage the papers were taken out from the examination house. There is a possibility the papers were sneaked out from the store. Since these staffers are even responsible for transporting papers from the centres to the Kalina campus, it could have been removed at that stage too. We will wait for the police report," said an official. The accused have been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and sections 7 (copying) and section 8 (abetment for copying) of the Maharashtra Protection of Malpractices at University and other specified board examination Act, 1982. All accused were produced before court and remanded in police custody till May 25. "All the 92 students, whose answer sheets have been seized, will be made accused and later arrested," said a cop. Police are searching houses of those arrested, besides scanning their call records and bank accounts. Police have seized Rs 1.18 lakh from the eight accused, including Rs 45,000 from Vaze alone.</text>

	<text>The election campaigning is over. The stage is set. There's a palpable excitement in the air as the State gears up for the polls today. Many voters would have already made up their mind as to whom they should vote for  depending on their agendas, allegiance and even their personality traits. Over the years, Mollywood too has showcased some interesting political personas. Who could forget the classic Sandesham, which had Sreenivasan and Jayaram as two warring brothers belonging to different political outfits? Its scribe Sreenivasan presented a satire that reflected Kerala .s politicians and their ideologies. In fact, Mollywood has brought to the fore leaders that fit every mould from the scheming politicians played by Narendra Prasad in Thalasthanam to Janardhanan's performance in films mimicking former Chief Minister, late E K Nayanar. Trivandrum Times lists out diverse politicians enacted by our top heroes: The master manipulator: Biju Menon in Vellimoonga Biju Menon's Mammachan is as shrewd as they come in the world of politics . To expedite his ascension in his political career, he joins a national party that has no roots in Kerala. He is given candidacy in an upcoming election but expresses his disinterest, hinting it would cut short his rise to a national-level career. How the wily tactician uses his wits to win the election and also the heart of his girl make him a sure-shot ballot winner in our list. Chief political strategist: Mohanlal in Peruchazhi While Mohanlal's Jagannathan is not vying for a seat in the comic caper, he knows exactly how the political system works and how to win votes. His astuteness makes the minister of his own party feel insecure forcing him to pack off Jagan to the USA as a political consultant for electing the governor in California. His modus operandi actually turns the table in the favour of his client as he uses the tried-and-tested policies of Indian politicians such as dividing the society on the basis of race and promising freebies. From a naive to model politician: Fahadh Faasil in Oru Indian Pranayakatha Fahadh plays Kottayam-based politician Aimanan Sidharthan, who is the blue-eyed boy of the district president of the party. His motives are driven by his ambition to be a candidate for the upcoming election. But a last minute change dashes his hopes as the high command decides to field the daughter of an influential leader. While he is duty bound, Sidharthan refuses to campaign for the chosen candidate and decides to take upon another job entrusted by the president, with an aim of earning some quick bucks. In the course of time he realises his true calling and becomes a model politician. Young, brash &amp; arrogant: Tovino Thomas in ABCD Tovino's Akhilesh Varma, a young and brash politician, breathed fresh life to such characters that are usually played by veteran actors. Akhilesh, who is thrust to power after the death of his father, bends rules to amass popularity and is also media savvy, pretending to be familiar with the ways of his voters by having food from a street shop just for the benefit of the camera. The political scion: Dileep in Lion Dileep plays a young politician who gets pitted against his dad, a political heavyweight who dislodges the previous government to fulfil his ambition to be the next Chief Minister. The father-son contest in the movie showed that when it comes to winning the polls, even blood relations take a back seat! The family man: Mammootty in Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu The megastar plays V Sukumaran, a youth leader of a minor party who mostly depends on his wife to support his career and family. His honesty and dedication are taken for granted by his superiors as they pressure him on dealing with the nasty issues and also by his juniors who take bribe in his name. Pressures in his political career soon spill into his family life forcing his wife to leave him. However, he soon gets appointed as a minister but his opponents drag the issues with his family to the forefront.</text>

	<text>Being a celeb means a constant public glare and thus most celeb relations become easy targets of scrutiny. READ: Brian Austin Green seeking spousal support from Megan Fox But there are celebs who have gone a step ahead and kept their exes or spouses under constant watch to keep a tab on their `activities.' The latest to join the bandwagon is Megan Fox, who wants to keep a sharp eye on the activities of her ex-husband Austin Green. Here are few more who did the same: MEGAN FOX ON BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN (2015) While Megan Fox was fighting a custody battle with ex-husband Austin Green, who demanded spouse support on account of his inability to work due to an injury , Megan has decided to keep an eye on his activities since she feels he has been `rather too active' recently to be able to not work, and his claim of inability to work is not true. BEYONCE ON JAY Z (2015) While Beyonce and Jay Z have been together for a long time and all seems fine, there have been reports that Beyonce recently hired a private investigator to keep an eye on Jay while she is away and report back to her on whatever Jay is doing. Sources, reportedly, have spelt trouble in paradise. KHLOE KARDASHIAN ON LAMAR ODOM (2013) Khloe might have been the first one to reach by his side in the hospital after his recent collapse due to drug overdose, but when they were married, Khloe had hired a tail to find evidence against Lamar for cheating on her. And the results were quite what she had expect ed, Lamar was found to have as many as five mistresses. MARIA SHRIVER ON ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (2011) What ended as one of the most expensive divorce settlements between Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, started with Maria hiring a private investigator (PI) to find out how much did Arnold worth and how much money she was dealing with. Arnold's flamboyant spending on his illegitimate family only added fuel to the fire. BRITNEY SPEARS ON KEVIN FEDERLINE (2007) Custody battles can really get dirty, and the same happened with Britney Spears, who hired a private investigator for keeping an eye on Kevin Federline's activities. Britney wanted to use Kevin's unruly behavior as an evidence in the court to get the custody of her children. VENESSA BRYANT ON KOBE BRYANT (2011) It all started in 2003 when Kobe was accused of raping a 19 year old hotel staff, but he refused saying it was `consensual.' Since then Vanessa knew her husband was a cheater, but she wait ed for the right time to hit back. She hired a PI in 2011 to gather enough evidence to file for a divorce and get the right amount of alimony . JUANITA JORDAN ON MICHAEL JORDAN (1988) The legendary basketball player Michael Jordan found himself out of sorts when his long time wife Juanita Vanoy filed for divorce citing `irreconcilable difference.' While the trouble had started long back in their marriage, Juanita hired a PI much later to gether all the right evi dences to win her an amicable divorce.

	<text>It is not easy being a transgender in India, let alone in Kerala, where they are ridiculed to such an extent that they keep away from all kinds of public spaces. But transgender and dancer Jazz D' Souza decided to take the chance when she auditioned for a TV reality show in a popular Malayalam channel. Not only did Jazz get selected, she received applause for her performances in the show, while becoming the first third gender contestant to participate in a TV show, probably the first in the history of Indian television. It is more than a personal victory but what is important is that she felt loved and accepted, says a beaming Jazz, as she opens up to Kochi Times about her bitter past, journey to the dance floor and dreams in life. I had a traumatic childhood I don't want to reveal my original name or other details but I was born and brought up in Pandalam, Pathanamthitta. I was outwardly a boy but my feminine mannerisms made me a butt of jokes among children in school. So like in the case of any other member of my community, my childhood and teenage were filled with horror. My family too couldn't accept my wish to live my life as a woman. There were times when I really wanted to end my life because of the continual abuses I had suffered. But I had strong hope that I would succeed one day. Being a member of the third gender, I was a loner in society. Public toilets were always a haunting experience. I have had to suffer physical abuses when I used the men's rooms. Women were more understanding and they have always allowed me to use their washrooms. The turning point One day, seven years ago, I ran away from home, unable to bear the torture. I reached Mumbai in pursuit of a livelihood.There is a space in Mumbai for transgenders like me and I started working as a bar dancer there. After saving enough money, I decided to undergo a sexual reassignment surgery. Thus I became a female two years ago, and got christened as Jazz D'Souza. After my transition into a woman, I was quite determined to succeed in life. I was always fond of modelling and wanted a glamourous profession, which is why I opted to be a dancer. One day I came across a notification online about the auditions for a dance reality show on a Malayalam channel. I am a self-taught dancer but being a transgender, I was not sure if I would get selected. But the producers of the show were impressed by my performance and I was in! At first, I was shy but the other contestants, judges and the hosts gave me a warm welcome and that boosted my confidence. I felt loved and appreciated as a contestant It takes several rounds for a contestant to become popular in the reality show, but I received lots of applause and love from the audience at my very first performance itself. It was the greatest recognition for a transgender like me. Being a member of the most ignored community in the country, the acceptance instilled hope in me. Just when I thought things couldn't get any better, my favourite actress Shobana, who was one of the judges, praised my dance performance and asked me if I would like to enter the film industry. I was also fortunate enough to share the stage with her for a few dance steps and it was a dream come true for me. I now have an identity The show gave me an identity and meaning in life. Now, wherever I go, people recognise me as a celebrity and wish me luck. The comments and support I receive from well-wishers around the world too make me feel blessed. I feel I can now walk down the streets as a member of the third gender with my head held high. I can't describe the feeling when young girls and boys approach me calling chechi and take selfies with me. It doesn't matter if I get eliminated from the show, because I got a perfect platform to showcase my talents and create a space for myself in society. My parents are yet to accept me The best moment was when the team dedicated a video album to me "The story of a transgender's life" in its 12th episode. The video was based on the incidents in my life. It went viral and even Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan shared it. It made my parents contact me after a long time. But they were still not fully happy with me and told me to live with dignity. They had seen my performances, and even though they did not invite me back home, my mother said I performed well on stage, which gave me some comfort. I wish to be an actress, social worker and mother During childhood my dream was to become an air hostess. There are countries which have transgenders as cabin crew and I wish our government too would allow it. Now I want to become an actress. I know I can't be a heroine, but I want to essay powerful roles in films. I also want to make use of my fame as a voice for my community and serve as a social worker. I want to be in the forefront to help people of my community live a dignified life. I also wish to get married to a man who will respect me. After becoming Jazz, I received several good proposals but when I reveal my identity to them, they withdraw. That saddens me. I hope to adopt a child as well and have a family, like any normal human being.</text>

	<text>Producers of the film are feeling super-generous as film crosses Rs 60-cr mark. It is appraisal season, after all. And why should film stars be any different? The leading lady and man of the biggest blockbuster in Marathi cinematic history, Sairat , have been awarded a bonus of Rs 5 crore each by its benevolent (and delighted) producers. The film itself is being seen as a landmark in Marathi film history. Cinemas to meet with the demand have opened 12 am and 3 am slots in rural Maharashtra, a phenomenon never heard of in the hinterland. But so astounding has been the word-of-mouth for the blockbuster that  the film has garnered Rs 60 crore at the box-office. The actors, who had been signed on for a meagre Rs 4 lakh, will now be given Rs 5 crore each, as announced by producer Nitin Keni , CEO-Founder of EsselVision Productions, and co-producer Nikhil Sane, who pulled off the modern classic on a shoestring budget of Rs 4 crore. "Yes, we are planning this as a small gesture of goodwill for the cast and it is not only the actors who will be receiving certain amounts of money, but also the extended cast and crew. We are finalising the paperwork, but at the same time are hoping that we do not have to close our accounting books soon, since the shows are still going houseful. Last week, there were three shows of Captain America: Civil War, three of Azhar and eight of Sairat in Mumbai suburbs," Keni laughs. Read: What Bollywood has taught Sairat director The career-defining roles have come to both Akash Thosar, 22, and Rinku Rajguru , 15, with the sort of serendipity that rustic fairytales are made of: eight months ago, filmmaker Nagraj Manjule spotted Akash Thosar, a local pehelwan, at the Jeur railway station as the youngster prepared to board a train to his hometown, Solapur. Manjule had written a story about a young boy falling in love with a girl, set against the backdrop of caste discrimination. He instinctively felt that if this beefed-up lad lost his bulk, he'd be great for the part. Akash, who lives in Pune's Aundh area with his parents and four younger siblings - two sisters and two brothers - was headed to the Jeur Kushti Akhada for a state-level championship. His father is a retired accountant and his mother a housewife.Akash supported his large family with the money he won at kushti matches, each victory bringing in Rs 1,000. Life was hard. "I went up to him and said that I wanted to cast him as the hero of my next film. He thought I was joking, so I told him that I was the director of Fandry (the 2014 National Award winner for First Film of a Director). We exchanged numbers, I told him that I'd be back in three weeks and that he'd be perfect for the role if he wasn't so muscular. He showed up at the station three weeks later, eight kilos lighter," recalls Manjule, who had already finalised Rinku Rajguru, a local from Akluj village in Solapur, who loved to dance, for the female lead. Movie Review: Sairat Rinku's journey to tinsel town is equally fascinating: she hails from one of the more well-to-do farmer families of Akluj in Solapur district. Rinku was prepping up for her ninth standard exams at the Jijamata Kanya Prashala and confesses that she did even not know "audition" meant. "Nagraj dada told me `Tu acting karsheel?' I said yes, dancing a bit and spouting a few lines. He gave me the role. I had only 15 days to study for my final exams and I still scored 81 per cent," she says proudly. The process to stardom was rigorous to say the least: for two months, the cast was holed up at Manjule's Pune home, reading the script and prepping for the role. Six months later, Sairat released on February 17 with English subtitles in 400 theatres. At the end of the second week, the total num ber of shows went up from 8500 to 14,000. "The Sairat craze has taken all of us by surprise. Who would've thought a Marathi-speaking Romeo and Juliet would eventually hit a 60-crore mark, a first in Marathi cinema. It's gone out of hand with midnight and 3 am shows being introduced at a hall in Satara," informs producer Nitin Keni. Also read: Sairat records in Hollywood; first Indian film to do so Keni though also insists that the fan tastic story and the score by composer duo Ajay-Atul is behind the film's dream run in theatres. "The rough cut was complete and we decided to gamble another Rs 60-70 lakh by sending Ajay-Atul to the US to record live music with 100 instrumentalists and musicians performing at the Sony Theatre in Los Angeles. Guess that paid off too," the producer explains, pointing out that the makers will not be selling the remake rights of the film, even if the largest production house in the country offers them a deal. "We are rolling with the Telugu remake of the film first, followed by a Gujarati version, and, of course, Hindi. The idea is to not make a sequel, but replicate this success in different regions," adds Keni. Aamir Khan praises Marathi film Sairat, asks his fans to watch the movie 00:54 Keni hosted a grand success bash at a Juhu five-star on Saturday night, which began at 11pm, when the teenagers who turned superstars overnight walked in. "If one year ago, someone had told me that I would be a superstar, I would have laughed," says Akash, who confesses that he is more used to being called Prashant, his Sairat character's name by now. "Mere parents and friends khush hai and sab mere saath selfie chahte hai, main isi main khush hoon. Aamir Khan and Irrfan Khan ne bhi meri taarif ki. Jin logon ko screen pe dekhkar main taali yan bajata tha, voh mujhe aaj screen par dekh rahe hai," he says. Ask him on his signing amount of Rs 4 lakh and what he plans to do with his five crores, he says, "Nahi, starting main toh koi contract nahi tha..." and the phone is taken away by the film's publicist, who says that contracts cannot be discussed with the media at this moment. Rinku, on the other hand, reveals via her publicist that she does not want to discuss her contract or the money she is going to receive. "I have not gone home since the film started and have been living in Pune and Mumbai. I want to continue studying and go home," confides the 15-year-old, who bagged a Special Mention at the 63rd National Awards for her performance as Archana `Archie' Patil. But she is instantly happy when asked about what she'll remember about Sairat for the rest of her life. "When we were shooting, 'Zingat' played for three days, and all we did was dance. That is what I want to do for the rest of my life," Rinku beams. WATCH: Zingat from Sairat:</text>

	<text>Wife of late writer Poornachadra Tejaswi, Rajeshwari Poornachandra Tejaswi, has raised objections against Regional Censor Board, for muting some of the dialogues in the movie Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu, which is the adaptation of the short story penned by her husband Poornachandra Tejaswi. Rajeshwari has reportedly said that people have read the same words in the book which was also retained when it was staged as a play. Dialogues are the soul of the movie; it is disappointing that audiences cannot enjoy those muted words. The film Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu which is currently in theaters has Shwetha Srivatsav, Sukrutha Wagle, Manasa Joshi and Kishore in the lead roles. The project has been directed by D Suman Kittur.</text>

The punch dialogue  which makes it clear that the film is based on the story of a village adopted by Mahesh  indicates the film's plot is inspired from Mahesh's plan to adopt his native village. In February, reports about Mahesh planning to adopt his ancestral village, Burripalem did the rounds. Namrata was quoted as saying, "We are going to work on several small details before proceeding further." While there has been no news of any development about the actor adopting his native village, but the idea seems to have inspired director Koratala Siva enough to come-up with a plot. Atleast that's what the fans of the actor reckon. Here's the teaser of the film:</text>

Mehta, who has been shooting in Vadodara for Kirtan Patel's urban Gujarati flick Bas Ek Chance, says, "There are a few people like Saumya Joshi who are doing commendable work for Gujarati theatre. However, the number is very few and there is a dearth of good writers today, due to which Gujarati plays are suffering. If we get more good writers, I am sure that theatre lovers in the state will show their appreciation for Gujarati plays."</text>

	<text>How would you like to watch the trailer of a movie that is set to be released in 2020? Yes? Okay. Set aside 7 hours and 20 minutes. You read that right. The trailer of Swedish film Ambiance alone is longer than the three Matrix movies combined. Wait. If the trailer alone is about as long as the first four Harry Potter movies, how long is the movie itself? 720 hours. That's a whopping 30 days. And this trailer has been termed a 'short trailer'. The first trailer, which the makers called 'teaser', had been released in 2014, and was 72 minutes long. Another trailer is set to be released in 2018. This, a 'longer' trailer, will be 72 hours long. The trailer does not feature a single cut according to the makers of the film. It is entirely black and white and does not feature a single line of dialogue. And it features only two actors. And here's is the truly eye-popping thing about this movie, according to a note from the fimmakers. "The final film will be screened once syncronised on all the continents and then deleted. Ambiance is 720 hours long (30 days) and will be shown in its full length on a single occasion syncronised in all the continents of the world and then destroyed. Ambiance will be the longest film made that doesn't exist." Ambiance is set to be released on December 31, 2020. It is being directed by Swedish filmmaker Anders Weberg, in what seems to be a goodbye ode to cinema. Incidentally, the longest film ever made is also Swedish. 'Logistics', released in 2012, was 857 hours (35 days and 17 hours) long. Ambiance, when it is released, is set to become the second longest film. Watch the 'short trailer' of Ambiance:</text>

	<text>It's incredible what working out for five hours a day, five times a week, for 140 days did to Goutham's perception of himself. From being any regular 29-year-old guy who was conscious of his flabby 78-kg frame, the actor has transformed into a mean machine who isn't shy of wearing just his body. "Oh, it feels great to have a ripped body, more so because I've never been this fit. I weigh 70.5 kg, mostly muscle. Looking at myself after working out, I feel good enough to face the world shirtless," exclaims Goutham, settling down for a chat at a coffee lounge in Jubilee Hills. "Mee cinema eppudu start avuthundi...?" (when will your film shoot start?) enquires the waiter while taking an order for green tea. "Next month," Goutham replies, smiling. "I can't wait to start shooting for it," he adds excitedly, referring to his upcoming film Manu. When returning from a friend's wedding in December last year, director Phani told Goutham that he'd have to go shirtless for a couple of scenes in the film. And that's what motivated him to hit the gym. "I started working out from December 15. We had a shoot on May 3 and I had to get in shape for it," recalls Goutham, who's gotten quite used to counting calories of his meals. Getting a handle over what you eat is the most difficult part of getting in shape, he reckons. "It's only a shade easier than getting the lower abs toned. I've been on a low carb-high protein diet and haven't eaten a single sweet dish all this while. For someone with a sweet tooth like me, it's a lesson in giving up," he remarks, with a smile. Dad Brahmanandam though was just worried about his face. "'Arrey, moham padayipothundi ra...' (your face is losing its charm), dad would remark, after watching me shrink. But after he saw my pictures, he was super excited," shares Goutham, who is playing a painter in the film tipped to be a psychological thriller. "Manu is a very intriguing character. He lives two lives  a hotshot painter by the day who turns into a thief at night," explains the actor, who is confident that this film would prove to be the elusive 'hit.' Box-office success has eluded him since making his debut as a 19-year-old back in 2004. "It was a dream debut for me. I was still in college then and was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Tanikella Bharani, MS Narayana, Sunil, Telangana Sakuntala and my dad. K Raghavendra Rao worked as the directorial supervisor," he recalls. The film was an average grosser, but Goutham got noticed and more importantly, he met wife Jyotsna while working on the film  she is the daughter of the film's cameraman, Srinivas Reddy. "We began seeing each other much later, we were just friends back then," says Goutham. Post his debut, Goutham took a break from showbiz to complete studies. He then went on to train under acting guru Satyanand in Vizag. Unfortunately, his next film, Vah re Vah, turned out to be a disaster. "That was a big mistake. But thanks to my last film Basanti, I managed to get noticed as a performer," explains Goutham's career seems nothing like his illustrious dad's. But Goutham is happy living in the shadow of his great father, who became the first actor to have acted in over 1,000 films. "My dad came from nowhere and did it all himself. He is a phenomenon, and I would be stupid to try and emulate what he did. But hopefully, I will make him proud one day. For now, I'm just focussed on being the best that I can be," he says, signing off.</text>

	<text>Of late, Mollywood has been gripped by cop movies with several A-listers queuing up to don the khaki and boots. But it's not just the police that are making a comeback as movies with prisoners are in vogue too! From Mathilukal and Kaalapani to Anwar and Munnariyippu, Malayalam movies have used prisons effectively to shape dramatic tales. This year alone has four films with stars such as Dileep and Dulquer Salmaan playing convicts. Here's a list of movies that have our actors behind the bars: Welcome to Central Jail Dileep's upcoming release, directed by Sunderdas, has him playing a Good Samaritan of sorts who takes on the blame of others and willingly undergoes jail terms. Its scribe Benny P Nayarambalam says, "There are a lot of innocent people who get charged for cases because they were at the wrong place at the wrong time. This story is about a man who bails out such people. However, he doesn't cover for murders or rapes but petty cases that would get him a maximum of a six-month sentence." Kammattipadam Director Rajeev Ravi's movie chronicles the evolution of a gangster from a ghetto in Kochi. Dulquer plays the protagonist Krishnan and which gangster's life is complete without a stint behind the bars? The actor had shot in Trivandrum Central Jail for a few portions as the character's younger self in his lean avatar. From its latest trailer, it's clear that Krishnan is not the kind who quietly serves his jail term as we get to see him go toe-to-toe with the other inmates. Urumbukal Urangarilla The thriller had Vinay Forrt, Chemban Vinod, Aju Varghese, Mustafa and Kalabhavan Shajon as prisoners. The film had Vinay Forrt's character Manoj being trained under the tutelage of a master thief played by Chemban. The two eventually are apprehended and sent to jail. Once behind the bars, the duo along with other inmates hatches a plot to take revenge against another convict, who had murdered Manoj's family. Karinkunnam Sixes The movie, directed by Deepu Karunakaran, presents the prisoners of Trivandrum Central Jail in a different light. It has its protagonist Manju Warrier playing a volleyball coach who trains a group of prison inmates in the sport, instilling confidence and team spirit among them. The elaborate cast of prisoners include Sudev Nair, Babu Anthony and Jacob Gregory. Upcoming Indrajith-Biju Menon movie The Jeethu Joseph-scripted movie is based on its director Ansar Khan's State Award-winning telefilm Mukhamukham. Biju Menon and Indrajith play convicts who are being transported from Peermade to Ernakulam. "About 80 per cent of the film will be shot in the forest. The movie is primarily about the two prisoners and the entire story is weaved around their journey inside a forest," Jeethu told us.</text>

	<text>Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's purple lipstick and Sonam Kapoor's dress at the red carpet sent the internet into a tizzy but away from the spotlight, representatives from the Marathi film industry too are making the most of their visit to the Cannes Film Festival. Here's a round-up of the Marathi presence at Cannes this year. Film screenings For any filmmaker, a screening at Cannes is like a dream come true and this time four Marathi films have paved their way to the prestigious film festival; Punarvasu Naik's Vakratunda Mahakaaya, Makarand Mane's Ringan (which was adjudged the Best Marathi film at the National Awards), Shivaji Lotan-Patil's Halal and Gajendra Ahire's The Silence. While Naik's film released last year, the other three are yet to get a theatrical release back home. Initially, only the first three were scheduled for screenings and The Silence, which is actress Anjali Patil's Marathi debut and also has director Nagraj Manjule in an important role, was on stand-by. Meeting and networking Apart from Ahire and other people associated with the films being screened at Cannes, some more cinema enthusiasts from the industry are also present at the festival. Actor and soon-to-be director Adinath Kothare, director Samit Kakkad, producers Suresh Jaisinghani and Vivek Kajaria are among those getting a feel of cinematic glory at the French Riviera. Adinath, who is there for a producers' workshop, recently met with Game of Thrones producer Bernadette Caulfield and Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. Before leaving for Cannes, Adinath had told us, "I am going to get acquainted with world cinema; trends, business and reach. This will help me with my directorial debut Paani." The actor has been posting photos and videos of his experiences online quite actively. Samit, who is at Cannes for the second time, informed, "I think this is a great place for all filmmakers to network, show your film to buyers and close deals. I met some sales agents who are interested in the worldwide distribution of my upcoming film Half Ticket and we will close a deal soon." Bollywood connect Another Marathi name that features in the list is that of Amruta Subhash. The actress is at Cannes for the premiere of her upcoming Hindi film Raman Raghav 2.0. The Anurag Kashyap film, featuring Nawazuddin Siddiqui, has earned favourable reviews at the festival. While Amruta's connection with Anurag is for a Hindi film, the latter is connected to Vakratunda Mahakaaya as a producer. WATCH: Aishwarya and Blake Lively at Cannes:</text>

Says Parthiv, "I feel that music in Gujarati films remains a largely untapped market and there is a lot that remains to be explored. In many ways, the musical success of Kevi Rite Jaish was a turning point of sorts and it was really encouraging for the industry. I have been recording for quite a few Gujarati films, and I think the scenario is changing for the better. Makers of Gujarati films are exploring new subjects and even composers are taking up new challenges, which is heartening</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress MP and actor Mithun Chakraborty on Tuesday surrendered to Enforcement Directorate (ED) an amount of about Rs 1.2 crore that he had received from scam-hit Saradha group of companies for being its brand ambassador. Sources said a team of lawyers and other representatives of the actor reached the probe agency's office at Salt Lake here and handed over a Demand Draft (DD) to the investigating officer (IO) of the case. "This was part of Chakraborty's earlier commitment that he would return the funds that he had received from the group. The DD has been given to the IO of the Saradha scam probe case," sources said. READ ALSO: Saradha scam: ED issues fresh summons to Mithun Chakraborty They added that the agency is satisfied with the said action and the statement recorded by the actor-politician regarding his role in the operations of the group, which has now become defunct in the wake of allegations against it of perpetrating a large-scale chit-fund scam in West Bengal and other states. During his last questioning by ED here in May, Chakraborty had provided the agency sleuths with a number of DVDs, CDs and scripts that he had got as part of being the brand ambassador of the Saradha group. The actor had done so to back his claim to investigators that his association with Saradha Group was "purely professional" and that he had no intentions of cheating or duping anyone. "He had told investigators that he had no inkling about any sort of scam that was being perpetrated. The actor had submitted all his personal and official records to the agency in this regard," the sources said. Chakraborty had also promised he would deposit the amount of Rs 1.2 crore he had received from Saradha Group so that it may be finally restored to the depositors who were allegedly cheated in the scam. The Rajya Sabha MP of the ruling party in West Bengal had told ED that he "actually acted in promotional videos and advertisements that were broadcast on television shows" made by the Saradha Group and that was done as per his contract. He told investigators that if he had bad intentions, he would not have undertaken the promotional activity and instead merely stashed the money away. The probe agency had in June last year questioned the actor in Mumbai after it detected that some money had gone into his account from Saradha business portals. ED subsequently summoned him again early this year following which the latest submissions happened. While recording his statement last year, sources said Chakraborty had told investigators that he had "no business dealings" with the now-defunct group which was headed by Sudipta Sen and that he would share all personal transaction details with them. ED sources had earlier said Chakraborty was reportedly sent the said amount for being the brand ambassador of a media platform floated by Saradha Group. The agency had registered a criminal case under PMLA in 2013 and has already questioned a number of people, including sitting MPs and political leaders, in this regard. The agency, till now, has found that a maze of 338 bank accounts and 224 companies were used by the perpetrators of the alleged ponzi scam which duped investors in various states including West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. CBI, probing the case on the directions of Supreme Court, has also filed a chargesheet in a court.</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday stayed the release of multi-crore film 'I', dealing a big blow to Tamil film industry which is still to recover from the commercial failure of Rajinikanth-starrer 'Lingaa'. 'I', featuring Vikram and Amy Jackson and directed by Shankar, was scheduled for release on the Pongal day, January 15. Justice R Mahadevan granted the interim injunction, restraining Aascar Films Private Limited, its directors V Ravichandran and D Ramesh Babu, besides Reliance Mediaworks Ltd, from releasing the film till January 30. The producers, distributors, film laboratories and digital projection services are "hereby restrained by an order of interim injunction till January 30, 2015 from releasing the movie in theatres all over the country, and in any country outside India. In the meanwhile, applicant (Picutrehouse) is directed to initiate arbitration proceedings," the judge said. The judge was passing orders on an application filed by Picturehouse Media Limited, Chetpet, claiming non-performance of commercial and financial agreements between it and Aascar Films. It wanted the matter to be settled by arbitration. While restraining all concerned from releasing the film in any format till January 30, Justice Mahadevan asked the litigating parties to settle the issue by arbitration in the meanwhile. He issued notices to the producers and directed them to file their response by then.</text>

Ketaki is featuring in upcoming Marathi film 'Youth' which talks about six youngsters and how they fight to get water for villagers. While taking about the film she said, "I am portraying a character of very sensitive girl. This film made me recall the severe water scarcity we faced in my childhood. I come from Vidarbha and I know how hard it is to get even a single bucket of water." Ketaki has even fetched water from tanker. "I remember, I was very young, yet I used to get water from tanker in a small bucket. We had to store water for the entire week once the tanker used to arrive. Today, I am happy that I am part of a film which talks about water scarcity and the problem our villages are facing today," she further adds. Many big names are associated with the movie including Vikram Gokhale, Javed Jaffrey and Swanand Kirkire. Javed has sung a rap song for the movie whereas a Bharud pictured on Sayaji Shinde and sung by Swanand Kirkire is attracting listeners. Even Armaan Malik has crooned a song for the film. The film also features Neha Mahajan of 'Coffee ani Barch Kahi' fame. Akshay Mhatre, Meera Joshi and Akshay Waghmare are also part of the film. WATCH: Trailer of 'Youth':</text>

	<text>Allari Naresh tied the knot with Chennai-based architect Virupa at 10 pm on Friday night, amidst beats of mridangam and nadaswaram. Post the thaali kattu ceremony, it was all fun and games, as the newlyweds were seen in their element during the 'talambralu', even as friends and family cheered them on. And almost four hours later, in the post-nupital ceremony where the bride and the groom vie with each other to retrieve a ring dropped in a pot, Allari Naresh had the last laugh. "Both of them played the game very seriously. While Naresh won the first two rounds, Virupa got the ring in the final round... We had so much fun cheering for them," said actor Nani's wife, Anjana, who's a close friend of Naresh. "It's truly a match made in heaven..." "The couple just can't stop blushing..." "They look very much in love..." "They look perfect for each other..."  these were just some of the comments overheard as Naresh and Virupa posed for pictures, took selfies with their friends and greeted their guests. The ceremony came to an end around midnight, soon after Allari Naresh took Virupa outside to show her the 'Arundhati nakshatram'. When Chandrababu Naidu stopped the show, literally... An hour into the ceremony, when Andhra CM, Nara Chandrababu Naidu walked in, along with son Lokesh, the rituals at the mandap had to be paused for few moments to felicitate a quick photo session with the couple. By then, both Naresh and Virupa were seated on either side of the curtain that separates the groom and the bride until the muhurtam; however, the couple made an exception for the chief minister and got up from their seats. And as soon as Chandrababu Naidu left the stage, the rituals proceeded without any further interruption. Later, CBN was seen spending some time mingling with guests at the venue, during which Naresh's elder brother Rajesh introduced his son, Aarav to him. The usually reticent CBN, who's just become a grandfather himself, seemed to be in an indulgent mood as he interacted with the tots who gathered around him. Cell phone-wielding young fans kept celebs on their toes Almost all the celebrities who graced the ceremony were kept busy by kids and youngsters who flocked to them for selfies. As long as there were no bodyguards around, the kids didn't let even a single celebrity go without posing for a selfie! From the wedding hall, to the mandap and even the food counters outside  the young uns were everywhere, ready with their phone cameras and selfie faces!</text>

	<text>When an exceptionally good singer meets with two brillaintly talented musicians, you know it is bound to lead to some musical fireworks. Recently, Bhoomi Trivedi, who is currently recording a lot of songs for Samir-Mana for a couple of different films, was in their studio, recording for a movie titled Matsar. But their bond is so special that not only did she record the song, the three of them also bonded over a cool jam session for hours. Says Mana Raval, "We have worked with Bhoomi on a lot of projects in the recent past and so it has become very easy for us to bond over music. She's a wonderful girl. We were all a little free after the recording got done surprisingly fast and so went on to do a little singing and music session."</text>

Confirming this, the actor told us, "I have a key role in the movie and my character will be introduced in the beginning itself. I can't reveal much about my role as it is being kept secret." Apart from Kamal, the action-thriller also has Trisha and Prakash Raj in prominent roles. Kishore is looking forward to working with Kamal, who he thinks is a "meticulous actor". "He comes with loads of experience and there is no one like him. I was just a spectator during the discussions that we had about the movie," he says. Kishore is currently busy shooting for Tund Haikal Sahavasa and is expected to join the cast of Thoongavanam in Hyderabad soon. He will shoot for the Tamil movie for the next two months.</text>

The all new Audi Q7 and the Audi A6 Matrix were the big tickets that helped in ensuring a stellar performance.

	<text>Bolli Movies' Tulu film 'Chandi Kori' that broke-even in 52 days of its release clocked its 100th day on January 2. Enthused by people's continued patronage to his film, director-actor Devdas Kapikad and the entire Bolli Movies team is all set to celebrate this occasion, that a handful of the 60-odd Tulu films released to date have achieved, with a bash scheduled to be held at Town Hall on Monday. All stakeholders of the film will be honoured on this occasion. Devdas told reporters here that the film has been running successfully in Kalpana theatre in Udupi, Suchitra talkies and Big Cinemas in the city for the past 100-days. "Suchitra theatre has been lucky for the production team in that it has helped buck a trend for Tulu films that only those Tulu films released at Jyothi theatre rake in the moolah," he said, adding that the box office at Suchitra had returned record breaking collection thus far with average daily collection of Rs 1 lakh. The film running for 100-days in Kalpana too is a record in that it is the first Tulu film to do so for any theatre in Udupi, he said, adding that Chandrashekar Holla, the exhibitor has confirmed that 68,000 patrons have watched the film in the last 100-days there. "'Chandi Kori' has broken the collection that hit Kannada films such as Mungaru Male and Yajamana brought for Kalpana," he said adding these are good, encouraging signs for the fledgling Tulu film industry. With the film attracting viewers in steady numbers at Big Cinemas even now, 'Chandi Kori' even achieved a record of touching 50-days in a suburban theatre Nataraj at Surathkal, he said. "No Kannada film has achieved this feat in Surathkal," he said adding even though Mangaluru is just 30-minute drive away, people in and around Surathkal have patronized the film in large numbers. This has spurred Bolli Movies to plan its next venture Barsa on a bigger scale, he noted. Incidentally, 'Chandi Kori' has not just been Tulu speaking districts phenomenon. Buttressing this, Devdas said, "A recent screening of the film in London attracted 175 viewers and plans are afoot to organize a second one for those who missed it." Film has been screened in Kuwait, Bahrain, and plans afoot to do so in Dubai, Qatar, Muscat and Australia. Film has done well even in Mumbai despite the limited screens available due to the Marathi first policy there, he said.

	<text>Those who watched Nivin Pauly-starrer Jacobinte Swargarajyam would have noticed a new face among the lead stars, the deep-voiced, formidable looking businessman named Murali Menon who poses a threat to the family in the film. The actor who played the role, Ashwin Kumar, is a well-known mimicry artiste and short film actor, and this is his first role in a full-fledged feature film. Interestingly, Ashwin too is a Dubai-based businessman in real life but he says he is nothing like Murali Menon. "I'm a clown actually, my parents often ask me to start getting serious about life." But this young man is quite serious about cinema, and says the role in Jacobinte Swargarajyam was a dream-come-true for him. "I have to thank director Vineeth Sreenivasan for that, for casting a debutant like me for the character. It was meant to be done by none other than Gautham Menon." So how did he bag the role? "Well, destiny and luck, I would say," says Ashwin. "I was supposed to do just a small role, and I was about to fly to India to attend a very close friend's wedding. At that point, Vineethettan told me, 'Gautham Menon won't be able to come to Dubai as all flights from Chennai are cancelled due to the floods'. I felt bad as I wouldn't be able to meet Gautham, but was wondering why Vineeth was telling me all this. And then he just told me, 'I want you to do the role'. I went numb for a moment," he recalls. "I was in two minds as I couldn't miss my friend's wedding but then, it was Vineeth Sreenivasan who was inviting me. Later that day I found that my flight too had been cancelled owing to the floods. So I won't say I thank the Chennai floods as it was a very unfortunate disaster but it did play a part in my career." Watching Ashwin on screen, one wouldn't think he is a debutant, but the youngster says his experience in short films and stage performances have definitely helped. "I have been acting in short films for seven years and have even directed one. I had no contacts in films, and was in Dubai. All I had was my friends who always encouraged me." What with his mimicry skills, would he do comedy next? "I would love to! But I don't believe in branding roles, all I want to do is situational roles; how people are like in real life." So what is he planning on next? "I'm the heir to the throne to my dad's business; it's our bread and butter, and I have to be here in Dubai. But I hope to strike a decent balance between business and cinema."</text>

	<text>For someone who shifted from doing a Bachelor's degree in science to doing a Masters in Drama, Shaunak's risk taking abilities are commendable. After doing some plays for college fests he has now acted in many plays including popular hit 'Preet Piyu Ne Panetar' and has also written and directed a number of plays. Shaunak found his calling as a theater artiste in college and made the decision to make his passion into his fulltime profession. "Initially it was slightly confusing, but when I realized that if I don't take this step now, I'd be working as a medical representative somewhere, collecting my salary and going home. Theater gave me a platform and made me a known face, I was not just making money but was also becoming famous. Had I been an MR, I'd never have done something I loved. Right then, the decision became easy." So what about the limited finances that Gujarati theater is known to have? "You must believe in yourself and the power of theater, you should be able to believe that doing plays will get you where you want to be, you will earn money and drive a car and live in a big house. To be able to survive in this industry, you should want to be in it badly. That's the only way I know."</text>

READ: ?'Paayum Puli' release stalled Hemalatha told in her complaint that she befriended the actor on Facebook. Later, they fell in love and got married. On February 6, 2014 the marriage was held at Sri Sai Mahal at Mettupalayam. His family members demanded 300 sovereigns of gold ornaments as dowry. But her family members gave 118 sovereigns and told them that they would provide the rest of the sovereigns later. The couple was living in an apartment at Ashoka avenue at Kodambakkam and later the couple was moved to T Nagar. Hemalatha said that she pursued BE (computer science) and was working for a software firm in Chennai. Initially, Krishna bought her a car to commute to her office while later she was asked to travel in bus. Krishna and his parents Sekar alias Kula Senate, film producer and Madhubala allegedly renewed the demand for 300 sovereigns of gold. But her family was unable to fulfill the demand.

	<text>That Prithviraj and Priyadarshan have teamed up for a movie is by itself a big news that Mollywood audience have longed to hear. We have now got wind of the details that the film, scripted by '1983' scribe Bipin Chandran, will go on floors by next year. Actor Manianpilla Raju, who is part of the film, says, "Priyadarshan had bounced off an idea to Prithviraj and he loved it. They are yet to develop the story as Priyadarshan also has another schedule of 'Oppam' with Mohanlal left. Right after that, he would be doing a Bollywood movie with Akshay Kumar." Raju, who will also be funding the film, says that the film will have a schedule in Sri Lanka. "The plan right now is to begin shooting the movie by January next year," says the actor. When we reached out to Priyadarshan, he said it is too soon to discuss the details of the movie as the script is yet to be completed. Meanwhile, Prithviraj is currently busy with the final schedule of Jeethu Joseph's revenge tale Oozham and will join the sets of debutant Jaykrishnan's 'Ezra' by the end of this month.</text>

	<text>Anupam Kher, who was in Vadodara recently for the play Kuchh Bhi Ho Sakta Hai, which was staged as a part of VadFest, feels that plays need to be promoted more aggressively in India, just as Bollywood films are. Said Kher, "More than anything else, it's the state of performing arts that best sums up any city and so, it's crucial that all of us support theatre as much as we can. Plays need to be marketed in a better way and it will certainly help if big actors, who go out of their way to promote films, do the same for plays too."</text>

He added that talks with filmmaker Shankar have been initiated, but it is still not sure when the project will go on the floors. "I recently met Shankar and discussed the possibility of a sequel to 'Indian'. Since he's busy with 'Enthiran 2', the project is unlikely to happen soon," said Rathnam. Shankar-directed 'Indian' featured Kamal Haasan in the title role. It was about a man who takes corruption head on. Asked if the sequel will feature Haasan in the lead, Rathnam said: "It's too early to talk about it." AM Rathnam also said he is planning to bag the theatrical version of Shankar's 'Enthiran 2' with superstar Rajinikanth.</text>

	<text>Anoop Menon, who plays an Army major in 'Kuttikalundu Sookshikkuka', is busy shooting for Don Max's directorial debut '10 Kalpanakal'. His role in the film, says the actor, is one of the toughest he has taken up. "I play a forest officer in the movie," the actor says. "After Cocktail and Traffic , it's the first time I am doing such a riveting thriller. At the same time, it's also a family drama as it talks about family values and our religious belief systems too. The film is much relevant to our time and addresses a pertinent issue." Ask him more about his role in the movie and the 'Vikramadityan' star says, "The focus is more on the father and husband he is than about his occupation. My character is a family man who lives in a sleepy hamlet near a forest. How he gets embroiled in a case forms the plot." Apart from Anoop, the film also has Meera Jasmine and Kaniha, both of whom have been missing from Mollywood for a while. "Meera plays a cop and hers is a major character in the movie," explains Anoop, adding that '10 Kalpanakal' is shot entirely in Idukki. Meanwhile, Anoop Menon's next release will be the sports drama 'Karinkunnam Sixes', which has him playing Manju Warrier's husband. The duo had previously acted together in G Marthandan's 'Pavada'.</text>

	<text>The Marathi film 'Sairat' has continued its golden run into the third week and is breaking records on its way. The film which collected Rs 25.50 cr in the first week of its release, went on to shatter Marathi BO records with a whopping collection of Rs 41.11 cr at the end of 11 days, according to the entertainment website Bollywood Hungama. Also read: Aamir Khan praises 'Sairat' In doing this, the film has surpassed the earnings of 'Natsamrat', 'Lai Bhaari', 'Duniyadari' and 'Balak Palak'. An interesting aspect to note about this collection figure is that it is much more than many Bollywood big ticket releases this year including 'Rocky Handsome' and 'Jai Gangaajal'. Furthermore, this feat has been achieved by the film in much lesser number of screens. While the Bollywood releases were screened across India, 'Sairat' released across Maharashtra and at a few screens in neighbouring states. The film directed by Nagraj Manjule and featuring Akash Thosar as Parshya and Rinku Rajguru as Archi, has been earning rave reviews for its realistic portrayal of a love story and its BO collection has only added to its success. 'Sairat's run at the BO stands to continue for another week due to no Marathi releases. Next week will be a testing time for the film with the Aishwarya Rai Bachchan-Randeep Hooda starrer 'Sarbjit' scheduled to hit screens. WATCH: 'Yad Lagla' from 'Sairat':</text>

	<text>After 'Gulumaal', both Jayasurya and Kunchacko Boban are once again at odds with each other in another Y V Rajesh script. In the upcoming Boban Samuel directorial Shajahanum Pareekuttyum, the duo's characters go all out to woo a girl played by Amala Paul. "In tune with its title, it's about two different perspectives of love with our characters being diametrically opposite," says Kunchacko Boban. "I play Pranav, a sophisticated high flying businessman while Jayan's character is a street-level goon. The movie is about how these two profess their love for the girl in their unique ways." About his character, Jayasurya elaborates, "His name is Prince and he's someone who is not bothered to stoop to any level to get a job done. His part in the story is that he's in search of his lost love." The movie is a full-on entertainer, says Jayasurya. "It's that kind of film where you have to leave your brains outside the theatre. The movie is packed with laugh-out-loud moments," he explains. Incidentally, it's the second consecutive movie for the duo  the previous one being Rosshan Anddrews' School Bus , which is a serious movie. "We play entirely different characters in School Bus. We are not friends in the movie and so we had to be in that frame of mind while shooting for it," Jayasurya says, adding that he plays Joseph, a dad of two children. For Kunchacko Boban too, School Bus has been a novel experience. "I play a cop for the first time in my career. My character R Gopakumar is not a flashy police officer who throws punches and punch dialogues at will but a very realistic character that people can relate to," says the actor.</text>

	<text>Recently on the eve of International Dance day, actress Shital Shah , shared that while the international dance forms are getting a lot of attention, Indian dance forms are somewhere dissolving on this huge canvas. The actress said, "It's good that we are opening to many International dance forms, but we must also give our Indian dance forms that much importance and keep it alive." She further added, "There are mainly two reasons, why one can see this decline are because of two reasons. Firstly, with so many reality shows springing up and a vast exposure to various dance forms through internet and social media , there's a huge demand for these dance forms. Also I believe that there aren't enough takers for the Indian classical dance forms, and hence one can see this decline." READ ALSO: 10 things you should know about Shital Shah</text>

	<text>With the schools closed for vacation, it seems that Mollywood has opened the doors for more movies with children playing the pivotal characters. Already three movies are under production with kids in central roles  Kunchacko Boban's 'School Bus', an upcoming Sunny Wayn film and Tovino Thomas' 'Guppy'. The latest to join the bandwagon is Kalavoor Ravikumar's 'Kuttikalundu Sookshikuka'. While the movie has Anoop Menon and Bhavana as part of the cast, it's Jo and the Boy star Sanoop Santhosh and Balaganapathy fame Siddharth Ajithkumar who play the central roles. "Their characters set off the plot with a particular incident," Ravikumar says.However, he adds that it is not a children's movie. "While it has its series of fun and feel-good moments, it evolves into a thriller." Of late, Mollywood has had several such films that have schoolchildren as key characters in spite of having superstars such as Mammootty, Nayanthara and Manju Warrier as part of the cast. Here are some such movies: Jo and the Boy The movie was billed as a children's film starring Manju Warrier. But it turned out to be an inspirational film about not giving up on one's dreams, no matter one's age. Sanoop's character provides the inspiration for Manju to accomplish her dream of becoming a renowned animator. Malgudi Days The film was inspired by a real-life incident in Nagaland about two school children, played by Janaki Menon and Vishal Krishna, who get trapped in the school campus. The movie also has Anoop Menon and Bhamaa, but it was the two kids who made the maximum screen time with eight-year-old Janaki winning a State Award for her performance in the movie. Ben The Vipin Atley movie, which was based on true incidents, was about kids but was definitely not a children's film. It told the tale of a mom and son, and how unrealistic expectations take a toll on the child physically and mentally. While Anjali Upasana, who played the mother, won a State Award for her performance, Gaurav Menon as Ben clinched the National and State Awards for the Best Child Artiste. School Bus The film, based on real-life events, is scripted by Bobby-Sanjay duo and directed by Rosshan Andrrews. It also has Kunchacko Boban and Jayasurya as part of the cast. Despite the heavyweights, the movie is told from the point of view of two kids and through them, the audience gets a peek in to the adults' world. The film reportedly is about a child-missing case, which Kunchacko's cop character investigates. Bhaskar the Rascal The movie has two superstars of the South  Mammootty and Nayanthara  but it was two child artistes who played the key roles in bringing the lead characters together. The former plays a widower while Nayanthara essays an estranged wife. Their children are schoolmates and their friendship leads to their parents becoming close.' Jilebi The movie showcased the clash of lifestyles between Jayasurya's rustic character and his Dubai-bred nephews. The kids played the central role in the movie that emphasised on the fact that one should value relationships over a person's financial status. Guppy The film has Tovino Thomas playing a civil engineer who comes to town to supervise the construction of a bridge. However, the central character is a 14-year-old boy, who makes a living by rearing and selling aquarium fish. Sunny Wayn's upcoming movie The upcoming film has Deiva Thirumagal fame Sarah Arjun playing a six-year-old school kid named Ann Maria. Sunny Wayn will be seen as a rustic youth, who enters her life by accident. How the two influence each other's lives forms the plot of this feel-good movie.</text>

	<text>Shivarajkumar's latest release Belli will be trimmer by 13 minutes from today. The film released last week and was 140 minutes long. The Mussanje Mahesh directed film is now shorter after audience feedback that some of the scenes were not effective due to their length. It is not uncommon for films to be trimmed after release. However, they have to go through the process of getting permission from the Censor Board even for deleting any scene. Recently films like Ninnindale and Ulidavaru Kandante were trimmed after release. Ninnidale lost as much as 18 minutes while Ulidavaru Kandante lost 12 minutes. There were some some exchange of words between Ulidavaru Kandante director Rakshit Shetty and producer Suni with the former accusing of trimming the film without informing the former. But the real trouble was for the film Adyaksha. There were objections to a song in the film about Lord Krishna. The Censor Board, however, did not find anything wrong and allowed the song in full. However bowing to pressure from a caste group, a portion of the song was deleted.</text>

	<text>Security at the electronic dance music (EDM) festivals Sunburn and the Supersonic held annually in Goa, will be heightened in view of a terror threat posed by extremist groups like the Islamic State (IS), Tourism Minister Dilip Parulekar said. ?ALSO READ: Goa govt yet to give nod to 'Sunburn', 'Supersonic' festivals Speaking to IANS on the sidelines of a media event at the state Secretariat on Wednesday, Parulekar also said that permissions for the two events were held in abeyance, until the organisers complied with requests for providing additional security cover."We want the best security in view of the IS threat. The single window permission committee headed by the chief secretary, which grants permission for such events has decided to ask the organisers of the events to increase security on site," Parulekar said. Chief Secretary of Goa, R.K. Srivastava heads the committee which grants single window clearance to major tourism related events organised in the state. Parulekar also said that some of the specific requests which have been made by the committee includes increasing the number of metal detectors at the EDM festival venues and sniffer dogs to keep track of possible explosive substances. "The police will be there, but the organisers will also have to increase the security in view of the threat. The permissions will be granted once they comply with these conditions," Parulekar said. Goa, one of the top beach and nightlife tourism destinations, hosts two of the biggest party events in the country namely Sunburn and Supersonic EDM festival which are held in the last week of December, which coincides with peak tourism season.</text>

	<text>Over the past few months we have heard of Marathi filmmakers and actors making it big with international offers. Well, it is understood then that actors and filmmakers from the other side will be happy to be seen in Marathi films too. One such example is Paula McGlynn. Paula, who hails from Vancouver, Canada, will be making her debut in Marathi films with fashion photographer turned filmmaker Prashant Patil's 'Pindadaan'. We speak to her about her journey from Canada to Pune and her future plans. Excerpts from an interview: Why did you choose to make a debut in a Marathi film? I came to India three years ago with an aim to make a career in the film industry. 'Pindadaan' came to me through a friend's friend, who was casting for the film. He thought I would fit the role perfectly. This is how I selected my first film as a lead. For me, it has never been about the language. It has always been about the right character, project and working with the right people. I am immersed in Marathi culture owing to a strong friend's circle and business partners who are Maharashtrians. So, my debut in a Marathi film is obvious. What about your character Ana appealed to you? The first thing I liked about this project that it is a unique opportunity for a non-Indian to play a character with so much depth and importance in a regional film. Ana is a complex character. The message and soul of the film was intriguing and I wanted to explore this aspect of it. You have been actively involved in various aspects of film making. Did it help you perform better as an actor? I believe the most important aspect for an actor is to get in touch with the character. One needs to mould into the character and believe in it. Secondly, you have to trust your director and have faith in his sketch. Prashant and the team have been extremely helpful with all of this. Yes, understanding the nuances of filmmaking helps when it comes to lighting and other effects. How fluent are you with Marathi? My character Ana is from England who comes to stay in Maharashtra. She falls in love and becomes one with the land and culture. My friend Rinki helped me with the language. She literally coached me. The script was in Devnagari so I learnt to write and speak the language. Siddharth Chandekar and Manava Naik helped me with my lines and made me feel comfortable on sets. I insisted on learning the language so that I could get the emotions right. It took me a month to get my dialogues in place.</text>

	<text>Just a couple of weeks post the release of 'Sairat', director Nagraj Manjule has been caught in the midst of a controversy. The filmmaker is currently the toast of the film industry post the smashing success of the recently released film, but an old legal case has come back to haunt him. According to sources, Nagraj's ex-wife Sunita is planning to reopen the lawsuit that led to their divorce a couple of years ago, with the hope of 'securing justice'. Speaking to us about the same, Sunita's cousin, Sagar Lashkare, informed, "They got married when he was in class XII and for 15 years, my sister was by his side through thick and thin. After turning director, Nagraj hardly ever visited his hometown and whenever he did, he never spoke to her." In 2012, a divorce suit was filed which came through in 2014, according to Lashkare. "Post the decision, he gave an amount of `6-7 lakh to us and had assured that he would give more as and when needed. That never happened. Today, he's a star director, earning in crores but not once did he think about ruining my sister's life. We don't want money or anything else. We only demand justice and that is why we want to reopen the case," added Lashkare. Akash Painter, a social worker from Pune, also tried to settle the matter amicably a few years ago. "When the lady came to us with her complaint, I called up Nagraj and asked him to meet me in Pune to sort out the matter. He agreed but never came. After that the matter went to court," said Painter. We tried contacting Nagraj but he wasn't available for comment till the time of going to press. (Inputs by Shashank.Sane@timesgroup.com) *This is an updated version of the story.

The Mumbai-based leggy lass, who also represented India this year at the Miss Universe pageant, has now returned from the US and was spotted on Saturday night at Bollywood superstar Salman Khan's 50th birthday bash. The actress, who is quite enthusiastic with her PR, has already sent across a picture of her with Salman clicked at the party to the media. And her PRs, given the current speculation over Salman Khan's heroine choice for his next film Sultan, have thrown in an interesting line claiming that "if rumours to be believed she can be Salman's heroine in Sultan".

	<text>Be it thrillers, romance or drama, Sandalwood viewers are in for a treat, as there are quite a few sequels in the pipeline in Sandalwood. While some of these star the same actors as the originals, others have newer, younger faces in the sequels that are underway. This year already saw Uppi 2, the sequel to director-actor Upendra's earlier self-titled film, albeit with some new faces added to the cast. Among those underway, we have Mungaru Male 2, which has the same hero, but a different director and heroine. Ganesh romances newbie Neha Shetty, with Shashank directing the new film. The 2011 hit Rajdhani, which was one of the early hits in Yash's career, is having a sequel with an all-new cast. Hariprriya is the heroine, opposite Preetham as her hero. Director Suni is currently completing the sequel to his film Simplag Ondu Love Story, which has been titled Simplag Innondu Love Story. The film stars TV actor Praveen and Meghana Gaonkar in lead roles. Kalpana, which was a remake of the Tamil film Kanchana, will have a sequel too. While there was a Muni 3 that was made after Kanchana, we wonder if that will be the subject of Kalpana 2. Also currently in the works is director-actor Kishan's sequel to his C/O Footpath, titled Care of Footpath 2. The film, to be released in Hindi and Telugu as well, has an ensemble cast of many known faces and stars Bollywood director Anees Bazmee and actress Esha Deol. Other sequels that have been announced so far include Ayya 2, Huccha 2 and Dandupalya 2, which have been greenlit quite a while ago, but are still in different stages of production. Both the Ayya and Huccha sequels have younger heroes replacing the original cast. Chiranjeevi Sarja will be seen in Ayya 2, while Dhananjaya was roped in to be in Huccha 2. Among the newer ones that will go on floors, Suri's recently released Manvitha- and Vicky-starrer will have both a part 1 and part 2 releasing, given that the film that hit screens was a part 2 itself. The Sriimurali-starrer Ugramm will have a sequel titled Ugramm Veeram. Certain scenes in KM Chaitanya's Aatagara also suggest that it might have a sequel, but the makers haven't confirmed anything. There has been talk about a sequel to the Yash- and Kriti Kharbanda-starrer-Googly and the Ramya- and Srinagara Kitty-starrer Sanju Weds Geetha, but we haven't heard from the makers after initial speculation and discussions about the projects.</text>

	<text>Mr and Mrs Ramachari is Yash and Radhika Pandit's third film together so far. The first two being Moggina Manasu in 2008, and Drama in 2012. Ramachari, the character portrayed by Yash in the film, is said to be inspired by the character of the same name portrayed by Vishnuvardhan in his 1972 film Naagarahaavu. Yash, in the film, sports a tattoo of that character on his chest, played by Vishnuvardhan, and plays the role of a fan of the character. Just like the character of Ramachari in Naagarahaavu, Yash too plays a rebel who is short-tempered. He is also a great fan of Ramachari and is inspired by him. Watch the trailer of Mr and Mrs Ramachari here.</text>

	<text>'Pisasu' fame Prayaga Martin's debut Malayalam movie is yet to release, but the actress seems to be signing many interesting movies with various kinds of roles. In her next film titled 'Ore Mugham', directed by Sajan, she plays an 80s college girl. Prayaga says, "My character is named Bhama and she is a bold girl. She will be mostly seen in pattu pavada and blouse, and 80s style salwars. I have been taking extra efforts to portray my character to match the era. From accessories to the mannerisms of Bhama, the 80s style will be clearly showcased. Throughout the movie, I will also be sporting the popular hairstyles of the time." Considering that even the casual conversations of the 80s were quite different from that of today, she adds, "We are paying close attention to the words used, gestures and expressions, while enacting our characters." Ore Mugham has actors Dhyan, Aju, Deepak, Arjun, Gayatri and Prayaga in important roles and they will be seen as college mates in the movie. The actress also has Pa.Va and Oru Murai Vanthu Parthaya coming up.</text>

	<text>All roads led to Shilpakala Vedika on Thursday. You might be sniggering at that cliche but that was the reality, so much that choc-a-block traffic even got the performing artistes of the Times of India Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival a bit delayed. Nevertheless, once the music began all pressures of the outside world were laid to rest as Dr L Subramaniam picked up his bow to play violin and conduct the amalgamation of the seven percussionists from across the country. In the first half of the show, the women of the family took the stage. Bindu's Let there be love and peace...  a perfect balm for today's fractured world was followed by Kavita Krishnamurti's, who took to stage amid applause and prayed for musical avenues beyond movies in her life as she sang a bhajan. However, she did perform her iconic film numbers  from 1941, a Love Story and Bombay. Then arrived the father and son duo (Dr L Subramaniam and Ambi), who performed in beautiful symphony a composition made to commemorate the 40 years of Indian Independence and performed at the United Nations, New York. But the audiences who were already in the trance had no idea what was going to come their way in the second half, following a small break. What followed next was a energetic second half that began with electrifying guitars for the track Time is right and then the highlight of the evening  the percussion symphony. "We are first going to try it on you and see your reaction and decide if we want to play it in other cities," quipped Dr Subramaniam, who walked up and down the stage at complete ease  as if the violin was a natural extension of his body and soul. Of course, the mesmerising symphony was received with loud applause  Hyderabad had not just liked it but loved it. The final piece had everyone from the Subramaniam family on stage  Kavita, Bindu, Ambi and even Dr Sumbramaniam's three-and-half-year-old granddaughter Mahati, who was welcomed on the stage with "awwwws" from the audience. As they sang, together and Subramaniam involved the percussionists on the stage in a playful juglabandi, one could picturise an average day in the Subramaniam household being full of beautiful music and symphony. After taking out time to talk to his fans at the end of the show, Dr Subramaniam, elated by Hyderabad's response, says, "Yea, most people jokingly say we are the Subramaniam gharana." And Hyderabad sure loved being part of the family.</text>

	<text>Several names have been doing the rounds to play the second heroine in Mammootty's 'Thoppil Joppan'. The team has now finally zeroed in on their actress with Mamta Mohandas signing on the dotted line. "She will play Maria, a medical student," says the movie's scribe Nishad Koya. Most of the story of the Johny Anthony's directorial evolves in the village Thopramkudy, Idukki, he explains. "Maria comes to the village as part of a medical camp. There's a mystery about her character that we don't want to reveal right now." Incidentally, the last time Mammootty and Mamta teamed up for a film was for Ranjith Sankar's 'Varsham', in which she played a doctor. The upcoming movie will mark Mamta's first project after 'Two Countries' late last year. The actress has also signed up for Rajeev Nath's 'Babysitters', which is set to begin filming by June in Washington DC. Mamta and Biju Menon play a couple in the film. Meanwhile, 'Thoppil Joppan' also has Andrea Jeremiah as the other female lead. "She plays Annie, who is Mammootty's love interest in the movie," Nishad explains, adding that Mammootty's character Joppan is an alcoholic. "Mammukka's character Joppan turns to alcohol to overcome a love failure. He hangs around with his four buddies most of the day. His other interest is Kabaddi and he is the captain of a team aptly named Cheers." The team, has currently wrapped up its Kottayam schedule, and will head to Wagamon, Pala and Thoduppuzha in the coming weeks.</text>

	<text>The brief, chaotic life of Bobbi Kristina Brown was never really her own. Born and raised in the shadow of fame and litigation, shattered by the loss of her mother, Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina was overwhelmed by the achievements and demons of others before she could begin to figure out who she was. Her demise was the most awful inheritance of all. Bobbi Kristina passed away on Sunday at Peachtree Christian Hospice in Duluth, Georgia, about six months after she was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub in the suburban Atlanta townhome she shared with Nick Gordon, the man she called her husband. She was 22-years-old. Bobbi Kristina Brown passed away July, 26 2015, surrounded by her family. She is finally at peace in the arms of God. We want to again thank everyone for their tremendous amount of love and support during these last few months,'' Kristen Foster, a representative for the Houston family said Sunday. For latest Music updates, follow us on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt;@TOIEntertain For the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook &gt;&gt;&gt;TOIEntertain Police said she was found Jan. 31 in the suburban Atlanta townhome she shared with Gordon. A police report described it as a "drowning.'' READ: No progress in comatose Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition Bobbi Kristina was the only child between Houston and Brown. She was hospitalized for months in Atlanta eventually being placed in hospice care after being found in a manner grimly similar to the way her megastar mother died three years earlier. The police report called it a "drowning,'' and Gordon said at the time it seemed she wasn't breathing and lacked a pulse before help arrived. Brown _ the sole heir of her mother's estate _ did have dreams. She identified herself on Twitter as "Daughter of Queen WH,'' "Entertainer/Actress'' with William Morris &amp; Co., and "LAST of a dying breed.'' She told Oprah shortly after her mother's death in 2012 that she wanted to carry on her mother's legacy by singing, acting and dancing. But her career never took off. Actor and producer Tyler Perry said she had a future as an actress after her debut on his TV show "For Better or Worse'' in 2012, but she only appeared in one episode. Aside from two ill-fated reality TV shows and the occasional paparazzi video, her image mostly showed up in the "selfies'' she posted online. She attended award shows and appeared on red carpets with her mother and father. She performed a duet on TV with her mother in 2009, singing "My Love Is Your Love'' in New York's Central Park. She became social media sensation, sending more than 11,000 tweets and attracting 164,000 followers. But Whitney Houston, known as "America's Sweetheart,'' was an impossible act to follow. The late singer sold more than 50 million records in the United States alone during her career. Her voice, an ideal blend of power, grace and beauty, made classics out of songs like "Saving All My Love For You,'' "I Will Always Love You'' and "The Greatest Love of All.'' She earned six Grammys and starred in the films "The Bodyguard'' and "The Preacher's Wife.'' Bobby Brown had a bad-boy image but also became a huge star, selling platinum records with New Edition and going solo before drugs and legal woes derailed his career. Bobbi Kristina appeared alongside both parents in 2005 on the Bravo reality show "Being Bobby Brown,'' which captured her parents fighting, swearing and appearing in court. The Hollywood Reporter said it revealed that Brown was "even more vulgar than the tabloids suggest,'' and managed "to rob Houston of any last shreds of dignity.'' Years earlier, as Houston was preparing to give birth to Bobbi Kristina, she expressly left Bobby Brown out of her will, putting everything in a trust "for the benefit of her children and more remote descendants,'' according to the Houstons' 2012 petition. For more interesting Music news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest&gt;&gt;&gt; timesofindia For latest Music updates, follow us on G+ &gt;&gt;&gt; The Times of India Entertainment After their divorce in 2007, Houston kept custody of Bobbi Kristina and raised her alongside Gordon, an orphan three years older than her daughter. Houston brought Gordon into her family, and while she never formally adopted him or included him in the will, both teenagers called her "mom.'' The threesome's tight bond was shattered when Houston's assistant found the singer's lifeless body face-down in a foot of water in her bathtub at the Beverly Hills Hotel just before the Grammy Awards in 2012. Authorities found prescription drugs in the suite, and evidence of heart disease and cocaine in her body, but determined that it was an accidental drowning. Bobbi Kristina, then 18, was at the hotel and became so hysterical she had to be hospitalized. "She wasn't only a mother, she was a best friend,'' she told Oprah Winfrey. She and Gordon then went public with their romance, posting defiant messages online after the tabloids accused them of incest. The Houstons tolerated their relationship, appearing with them on television that year in Lifetime's reality show "The Houstons: On Our Own.'' But in one telling episode, the late singer's relatives lectured the pair about drinking after they show up in an obviously altered state, and accuse Gordon of failing to take care of the grieving girl. Relations between Gordon and some other relatives continued to sour over the past year after Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized. A protective order barred him from being within 200 feet of Pat Houston, Bobbi Kristina's aunt. A feud erupted over whether Gordon could visit Bobbi Kristina while she stayed in the hospital. On June 24, Bobbi Kristina's court-appointed representative sued Gordon, accusing him of misrepresenting his relationship with Bobbi Kristina. The complaint accused him of being violent toward her and taking more than $11,000 from her account while she was in a medically induced coma after the Jan. 31 tragedy. The lawsuit accused Gordon of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment and conversion. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he and his office are interested in reviewing the investigative file to determine whether any charges will be filed. Also on June 24, Pat Houston said Bobbi Kristina had been placed in hospice care. Bobbi Kristina was fabulously wealthy for a teenager, but her money was in a spendthrift trust, designed to keep creditors and predators from taking advantage of people who can't manage their money. Bobbi Kristina's grandmother, Cissy Houston, and aunt, Pat Houston, eventually took over control of the trust and then took Bobbi Kristina to court to protect the estate. The Houstons called Bobbi Kristina "a highly visible target for those who would exercise undue influence over her inheritance and/or seek to benefit from (her) resources and celebrity,'' and urged a judge to delay how quickly she could control the money. Bobbi Kristina agreed to the delay, and the judge granted their request to seal the case. The size of Houston's estate is a privately held secret. In May, a judge appointed Bobby Brown and Pat Houston as co-guardians of Bobbi Kristina, giving them joint responsibility in decisions related to her care and medical needs. Lawyer Bedelia Hargrove was appointed conservator to oversee Bobbi Kristina's assets, including her rights and legal claims. Houston signed a $100 million record deal in 2001, but failed to deliver, and lost two homes to foreclosure toward the end of her life. But her early death revived a hunger for her music, and her name and likeness generated revenue that became part of Bobbi Kristina's inheritance. By January 2014, the young couple who grew up as brother and sister were sharing a townhome in Roswell, Georgia, and calling themselves husband and wife. They posted images of their hands wearing wedding rings, with the caption "(hash)HappilyMarried. So (hash)InLove. If you didn't get it the first time that is.'' They got identical "WH'' tattoos with flying doves on their wrists, and Gordon added a large portrait of Houston's face on his arm. Their marriage announcement troubled Pat Houston, who obtained a restraining order against Gordon two months later. "Damn, lol, it's incredible how the world will judge you 4ANY&amp;EVERYthing,'' Bobbi Kristina tweeted at the time. By last September, Pat Houston said she was "very proud of Krissy.'' "Young people today are up against so much with social media and everything else that presents itself to them,'' Pat Houston told The Associated Press. "We try to be there for her, just to try to guide and direct her.'' Judging from her postings online, Bobbi Kristina was focused on the approaching anniversary of her mother's death. In one of her last tweets, she said, "Littlelady&amp;yourgrowing young man (at)nickdgordon miss you mommy ..:') SOmuch.. loving you more every sec. (hash)Anniversary!''

	<text>Prithviraj has always said that he does every movie with total conviction. His latest film, James and Alice, got a luke warm response at the box office, but the outcome is not a criterion, he tells us. "Regardless of the outcome, it will be one of my favourite films." The reason? "Because there are a lot of thoughts discussed in the film which are very personal for me and I agree to." The actor adds that initially he was surprised that the director, Sujith Vasudev, who is a cinematographer, chose such a film for his debut. "Sujith is a good friend and we have worked together earlier. But James and Alice occurs mostly within rooms, with conversations between people forming the major portion of the film. It is not a cinematographer's delight, in that there are no spectacular locations. It is not the easiest film for a debutant either, but Sujith has done an extraordinary job." Prithvriaj and Vedhika play a couple in the film, who go through a rocky patch in their marriage.</text>

"After much thought, KTR garu and myself have chosen to adopt Siddhapuram village of Kottur mandal in Mahbubnagar district. Looking forward to a constructive and meaningful journey ahead," he said on his Twitter. The star adopting a village for its development has been on the cards for now. Actor Prakash Raj also recently adopted a village in Mahbubnagar district. However, Mahesh Babu earlier had also adopted a village in Andhra Pradesh. He adopted Burripalem village in Guntur districts. While the local authorities will help in drawing up plans for the overall development of the village, the funding will have to be provided by the star. This is an initiative of both the Telangana and AP governments which want prominent people to adopt villages and change their complete face in order to provide them better facilities.</text>

	<text>Naishadh Purani, the director of much talked about play Taap is taking life easy and enjoying himself after the successful staging of this play. The play that was staged at Natrani was quite a talked about. When we asked Naishadh about his experience with the play, he shares, "When I was in the process of thinking about the subject of the play, I was in two minds whether to make one on serious-intense topic or to come up with a comedy one. Ultimately, I chose this topic of exploitation of women in different social circles as well as age groups. It is a burning issue and to deal with this play carefully was much needed." He goes on to add, "I'm happy with the feedback I have received. People were convinced with the idea." Naishadh is also brainstorming currently for his next theatre work. But usually most Gujarati audience prefer comedy as a genre when it comes to theatre. What does Naishadh think about it? "Commercially, people still opt for a comedy play in Gujarati. But, now I strongly feel any theatre work which has a good content and execution is accepted by audience. Also, social networking has been a boon for all the artists like us as we can get better understanding and involvement from audience." In the meanwhile, team Taap is all set to travel across country for more shows.</text>

	<text>Lavanya Tripathi just can't seem to stop herself from breaking into a guffaw when talking about her upcoming rom-com Bhale Bhale Magadivoi. "This is my first romantic comedy and I've never had as much fun as I did on the sets of this film. In fact, I had tears of joy just listening to director Maruthi narrate the script. I was literally rolling on the floor laughing," says a visibly excited Lavanya. Admittedly, her co-star Nani and director Maruthi would constantly tell Lavanya to stop laughing. "Whenever a scene was discussed or being shot, I used to imagine how it would translate on to the screen and a movie would run in front of my eyes and I would immediately burst out laughing. Nani and Maruthi would say, 'You are giving us over confidence. You laugh on everything and we think we are doing it so well. Hopefully it's not just you who finds it funny.' But my laughter was genuine and I think it will be like that for everyone who watches it," shared Lavanya, adding "I am very happy with the way it has shaped up. So my excitement is pretty obvious." The actress fondly recalls her experience of working with Nani, with whom she is teaming up with for the first time, saying, "I always wanted to work with Nani. So this opportunity was a great one. Despite being around for over six years now, it's incredible how he still is like a newcomer on the sets. Nani is a consummate actor and is very keen about his work and puts in extra effort into every single shot. He is very spontaneous too," says the actress who learnt Kuchipudi for this film. Lavanya plays a classical dancer in the movie, but her favourite song though is a beach song, Hello Hello. "We were shooting for it and the same day it started raining. It was apparently the first rain of Goa. I just love rain and the choreographer asked me to just go and enjoy myself and do what I like. I had a really fun time. Nani was forced to join me because I couldn't be in the shot all alone!" recalls Lavanya who happened to run into a childhood friend when shooting in Goa. "She was my friend in college and it was such a proud moment for her to see me working. She had seen me as a kid and now like this shooting and all. It was overwhelming," recalls Lavanya, who confesses to missing shooting for the film. "Every moment on the sets was so much fun. Frankly, I miss the whole crew because we had become friends. It is a thing which happens after every film but this time the film being a funny one, we laughed so often that the memories will remain sweet ones," she says signing off. Bhale Bhale Magadivoi, produced by Bunny Vas and presented by Allu Aravind under Geetha Arts, UV Creations banner, is releasing on Sep 4.</text>

The actor, who is currently at the Cannes Film Festival , met Game of Thrones producer Bernadette Caulfield at a producers' workshop there. Among other things that were discussed, Bernadette expressed her desire to shoot in India and also enquired about Adinath's TV show 'Ganpati Bappa Moraya'. "When I told her about the animation work in 'Ganpati Bappa Moraya', she was quite surprised and wanted to know more. She also said that she has plans to shoot for a project in India soon," informed Adinath.

And it was pretty evident when Sunburn Reload, a mini version of the immensely popular Sunburn music festival held in Goa, was held at Sevasi recently. Barodians had been waiting for this event with bated breath and the wait proved to be worth it. Indra J, Anish Sood and Piyush Bhatnagar (who is popularly known as Sound Avtar), the three artists for the evening, were in fine form throughout the evening and the young crowd had a fantastic experience.</text>

The glitzy audio launch, which also had Superstar Rajinikanth and Kannada actor Puneet Rajkumar as the special guests, had a special segment where bodybuilders who were part of the film, put on a show to a medley of filmi numbers. Arnold was moved by the show and individually congratulated every one of the bodybuilders. He went off script and took to the stage immediately, and said, "It feels like I'm back in my good old bodybuilding days. I thank director Shankar for giving these bodybuilders a job. But what about me? I came all the way from Hollywood looking for a job here. I want to act in your movies. Make a movie here with me, maybe Conan..." The actor also thanked the producer of I, Aascar Ravichandran, with who he said he has been associated for long. "He has been promoting my films in India in a huge way and I thank him for that," he remarked and signed off with his trademark dialogue, 'I'll be back'.</text>

The performance, called 'Sva Kranti', was based on the Gandhian ways that women could adopt to question and ponder their role in society. There were on-stage imagined dialogues with Mahatma Gandhi, where Mallika raised some questions that are vital in any woman's journey, especially when they want to go against the established societal norms.

	<text>CANNES: A fake terror attack panicked guests at the French Riviera hideaway of several Hollywood stars at the Cannes film festival, police said. The publicity stunt, by a French internet company aimed at the super rich, saw a speedboat full of men in helmets and military style uniforms attempt to storm the dock of the five- star Hotel du Cap just around the bay from Cannes. Guests said the men were dressed as an "ISIS-like" militia group, referring to the Islamic State group which killed 130 people in a night of attacks on Paris six months ago. Their inflatable speedboat also flew a black flag similar to the one used by IS. Chillingly, the stunt happened on Friday, the first Friday the 13th since the bloodshed in Paris last November. American publicist J.R. Savet, who was dining on the terrace with Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter when the boat approached, said guests were shocked. "Someone screamed and people jumped out of their chairs and started moving quickly to the swimming pool area. It was pretty scary," he told the Hollywood Reporter. Cannes has been on high terror alert for the 12-day film festival, with a warship moored in the bay and snipers posted on hotel roofs. Oraxy, the Paris-based internet company that organised the stunt, has not yet replied to AFP requests for comment. It describes itself on its website as "the world's first private global marketplace reserved... for Ultra High Net Worth Individuals." A police spokesman told that the men involved in the stunt had earlier tried to breach a sea exclusion zone around Cannes but had been repulsed by the authorities. He said that the men then tried to land at the hotel. Paramilitary gendarmes seized the boat, but the men were not formally arrested. "These men know that they have really overstepped the mark and today they feel ashamed," he added. A justice official told that those behind the stunt were "likely to pay very dearly," and would be prosecuted for breaking maritime rules and for inflicting "psychological trauma". The authorities were also investigating who owns the boat and rented it out, he said. The speedboat had earlier buzzed the yacht of Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg, the "Seven Seas", and another owned by Russian billionaire and Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The Hotel du Cap - also known as Eden Roch - on the ritzy Cap d'Antibes, refused to comment on the incident or say which stars were in the hotel at the time.</text>

In the serial,, Chandan, who was shown as married in the plot, has been kidnapped by miscreants for the reasons best known them. It is said that a new actor will essay the role played by Chandan in the serial Lakshmi Baramma. The makers of the serial have remained tight-lipped when it comes to talking about the new actor who will essay Chandan's role. Now, the serial watchers are curious to know whether the new actor will do justice to the role which was originally essayed by Chandan to perfection. The actor, who is yet to get married in real life, has been shown getting married twice in the serial. Currently, the actor is now working on the movie Luv U Alia, directed by Indrajith Lankesh. He has completed shooting for the movie Katte which has Nagashekhar and Shravya in lead roles.</text>

	<text>Priyanka Kothari, earlier known as Nisha Kothari, is back in the Kannada film industry after a hiatus. The actress had signed up for the film Bullet Rani a while ago, but is now said to have resumed shoot for the same. The woman-oriented film is said to be starring the Bollywood actress as the protagonist. Priyanka will be required to do quite a few stunts in this one as she plays an aggressive cop. Priyanka was last seen in the Kannada film Dandupalya where she played a victim attacked by the Dandupalya gang. She was to do another Kannada film called Yaaradre Nanagenu, but the film did not see the light of day.</text>

	<text>"My thatha's death was the biggest blow I've dealt with in all my life," says Rana Daggubati, recalling how he broke down inconsolably when 'Movie Mogul' Dr D Ramanaidu passed away earlier this year. "I have never seen death in my family, especially not of someone who's so close to me...I might be this big guy from the outside, but I'm very sensitive when it comes to my family," says Rana, who admits that he misses his grandfather more than ever as time goes by. "He would have turned 79 today had he been around," says Rana, his voice choking with emotion. "It was only after he passed on that I realised how much my life revolved around him. Whenever I pass by his car, room or office, which all lie empty now, I feel his absence. It's difficult to put it in words, you know... It's almost like there is so much left to say, but you just don't get a second chance..." And yet, Ramanaidu lives on in the collective memories of the Daggubati family, avers Rana. "We tend to talk about him a lot more these days... He is part of almost every conversation we have at home. After all, he was the pillar of the entire family; his demise has left a huge void which cannot be filled." Life was in the little details for Ramanaidu, and the family still strives to keep intact the little traditions he started. "For instance, he always insisted that the entire family eats together, as long as we were in town. So, two of the three meals were a family affair. We still keep that practice intact," Rana says. Life lessons Ramanaidu gave him is the other thing that Rana holds close to his heart. "He taught me the value of discipline and punctuality... he was a living example of that. He was a methodical man and he stuck to the same schedule with clockwork precision all his life. He'd leave home at 9 am, return for lunch at 1 pm, rest for a couple of hours, and step out again at 4 pm. His day would end a little after 8 pm, post dinner. we were all in perfect sync with his timing. And we all imbibed this discipline into our own lives." As it goes often with life and death, what's left behind are a handful of memories, and Rana says it's the fond memories of time spent with his grandfather as a child that he treasures the most. "I remember spending a lot of time with thatha in my native village, Karamchedu. when we first moved to Hyderabad, I remember him taking me on long drives in his new car every time there was a power cut at home. This was in the early 90s, when the Jubilee Hills area was still a sparsely populated, hilly terrain... I'll cherish those memories forever." So, like most grandparents do, did Ramanaidu also wish to see his grandson married? "Oh... not really," Rana says, adding, "He never liked to impose his thoughts on others. Thatha lived his life to the fullest and he wanted us to do the same. Now you know where that side of mine comes from," he quips, with a smile.</text>

	<text>After working out for almost one year, actress Raashi Khanna has finally shed the chubby look and is "six kilos lighter"! What the actress is most surprised to discover was that, yoga and meditation turned out to be more effective in her case, than hitting the gym. "I used to work out twice a day; but to no avail. I kept adding muscle, without losing fat despite following a diet of fish and eggs. It all changed when I went to a spa resort near Haridwar earlier this year. I began to meditate, practice yoga and walk a lot every day. And all that helped me detox." Her exercise regimen is a combination of yoga, dance, walking and two days of functional training at the gym, every week. The trick she lies in figuring out your body type, she says. "I lost six kilos in the past few months, but more than that, I finally figured out what form of exercise works best for my body. It feels great, you know. I've been training in contemporary bollywood dance and working on all the thumkas. I keep pushing the bar and I'm surprised I can pull off some good moves. It's also a good cardio exercise," she says, laughing. Of late, Raashi has been juggling between the sets of Ravi Teja's Bengal Tiger and Ram-starrer Shivam. "Ram is extremely talented and he's full of surprises. Moreover, he has helped me a lot to get my expressions right while acting in a scene. On the other hand, Ravi Teja is a bundle of energy and he's extremely fit. There's always a positive vibe on the sets when he's around," she says signing off.</text>

	<text>Actor Siddharth Shukla, who will be making his filmy debut soon, credits his success to TV shows. I WILL NEVER LEAVE TV Actor Siddharth Shukla is absolutely certain that he will not leave television. After signing a three film deal with producer director Karan Johar, Siddharth is making his Bollywood debut with Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. While in Lucknow to promote the show Balika Vadhu, in which he plays Shivraj Anoop Shekhar, Anandi's husband, Siddharth says that he will try and work out a balance between TV and films. "Whatever I am today is because of television, so I will never leave TV completely. As it is, films are a new experience for me where as TV is a known medium. A lot of credit for my success today goes to the serial Balika Vadhu," says the tall good looking actor. ALSO READ: Siddharth Shukla gets nostalgic 'Jhalak...' set BALIKA IS NOT AT THE END OF ITS ROAD Defending his show Siddhartha says that viewers are still loving his show. "See, everyone at some point of time feels a little lazy and drained out. Similarly for a TV show too. Kabhi achha lagta hai, kabhi nahi. This see-saw thing goes on everywhere but that doesn't mean you put an end to it. In fact later, you will work doubly hard to make up for that complacency. Same is the case with our show. We are constantly coming up with new tracks to keep the viewers attracted to the show. And it's simple, had the show not been doing well, the channel wouldn't have kept giving us extensions. It's been running strong for the past six years. There's a lot more left to do in Balika...," says he. TV IS NOT A FEMALE DOMINATED MEDIUM Siddharth doesn't feel that content on TV is women oriented. "Nothing can work without a balance. I agree Balika... initially focused mainly on Anandi, but over the years, even the men are getting their due. In fact I feel that goes for all shows on TV. There are no leads in a serial. Mainly because a story can't function with just one person. At some point or the other, every character gets prominence over the others and they become the lead in the show at that time. For instance in Balika..., the focus is on my character Shiv these days, so in that sense I am the lead," says Siddharth with a smile. READ: No girl would want to be in relationship with me says Siddharth Shukla NO TIME FOR LOVE Touted as one of the most eligible bachelors of the small screen, Siddharth takes the compliment with a question , "Really? Where are the girls?, adding, "I like the company of women but given my present situation I am sure no girl would like to date me. I have such a busy schedule from 5 am to 11 pm, that I can't devote time to anyone however much I may like to. For the time being I have to remain single," says he with a shrug.

	<text>Rani Chatterjee recently wrapped up the shoot of her upcoming film Ichchhadhari. The interesting bit is that she is romanced animals in the film. But these days, she is fed up with the numerous rumors going on about her in the media. There were reports that she is romancing her Ichchadhari co-star Yash Mishra and that she has locked lips with him in the film. Reacting to these news, she said, "I have neither done a liplock scene ever nor do I have any such intentions in the future. I am like a common Indian girl. Why would I create problems in the life of a married man (Mishra)? All such news is rubbish. I only share a professional relationship with Yash." She added, "I don't know who is spreading such silly rumors. Personally, I am too disturbed by all this." Currently, Rani is shooting Hum Hai Jodi No. 1 with Ravi Kishan in Lucknow despite facing health issues. After this one, she will be shooting Rani Ki Aayegi Baarat where she would be playing the character of an extremely shy girl. (Source: Bhojpurimedia.com)</text>

	<text>Sai Pallavi is not just an actress any more. The 'Malar miss' of Premam, who stole the hearts of Malayalis through her debut film, has just graduated from her university in Georgia and is a doctor now. In an exclusive chat, 'Dr Sai Pallavi' speaks on the joy of graduating, her future plans, movies and more: So, you are now officially a doctor... As I speak to you, I am at the convocation ceremony and I am overjoyed! The mood here is quite vibrant and I'm enjoying every minute of it. Since my childhood, I used to tell my parents to keep a tab on their health as if I was a doctor. Now I am officially one and I hope my parents will finally take me seriously (laughs)! Now that you have graduated, will medicine take precedence over acting? I don't plan anything in my life. I have a few more exams to give, but if I get good opportunities and challenging roles to play, I would love to continue acting. I will definitely stick to medical profession, no doubts about that! Was wearing a stethoscope and treating people, always your dream? Becoming a doctor has not been my ambition, as such. The aim was to help people, to feel better, to know what is good and what is not. We all know that smoking is harmful and we all are exposed to secondary smoke, but not many know the harmful effects of it. I always wanted to create awareness and spread the word that it is important to respect one's own body and work towards its well-being. If not anything, I felt that I can at least take care of the people around. I wanted to learn more about body and health, as it is a wonderful gift of God. The last year of your college might have been the most hectic one for you, as you had to juggle films and studies. How difficult was it? It was a bit hectic, but for the past three months, I have been detached from the film world to focus on my studies. It was still tough to not think of movies as people kept tagging me with film-related posts. But somehow, I managed to concentrate and I'm happy about that. When I am in India, I feel pampered. However when I am in Georgia, I am on my own, as I have to cook and do things all by myself. However, that gives me an independent feeling. Your upcoming projects I have been reading several scripts, but nothing has been finalised yet. I believe if you are destined to do something, things will definitely happen. The character Malar is something that I never expected to happen, but people lapped it up and the role is quite close to my heart. Now, I believe God selects the best for me. In a recent photo shoot for a magazine, you were presented without pimples and a lot of fans commented online that Sai Pallavi did not look herself in those snaps. Did it bother you? Who wouldn't be happy to hear that? Every girl would want to hear that she looks good without makeup. I was overjoyed because of the fact that people love me for who I am. When it comes to conventional beauty standards, things such as pimples can affect one's self esteem. My sister is going through a similar phase due to peer pressure. To empower her, my well-wishers take my name saying that I am an example for her. It feels good. How did you handle the rumour 'Mani Ratnam rejects Sai Pallavi'? Just like anybody else, I have been following Mani Ratnam sir and I love his works. He knows who is the best for the character and what is good for me. I don't consider it a controversy, as he was sweet enough to tell me that there have been a few changes in the script. He was very kind to explain me why it needed a change in the cast. So, I don't think I had to get affected by it and I'm not, either.</text>

	<text>After showcasing power-packed performances in Vikram Bhatt's Horror Story and M Sasikumar's Easan, Bollywood actress Aparnaa Bajpai is all set to make her debut in Mollywood with the upcoming film Shyam. The model-turned-actress will be seen as Rahul Madhav's romantic interest in the film. "I play Sindra, a sweet 'Malayalikutty', who meets Rahul's character Shyam in her college. He woos her until she says 'yes' to him," explains Aparnaa. "The film is about relationships and our love story is pivotal to it." Aparnaa began her acting career with an ad film alongside Aamir Khan. So what prompted her to foray into Mollywood? "Acting is my passion and I believe you can give your best no matter which language you are acting in. Also, my friends kept telling me that I will have a lot to take back home after working in a Malayalam movie," she gushes, adding, "And it was really easy for me to mingle with my co-stars and face the camera here as I have already worked in two Tamil films." The actress is also currently busy with a Bollywood film titled XXX, an erotic drama directed by Ken Ghosh. "It's a portmanteau movie with four short stories of different genres. Mine is a female-oriented vignette and I play its protagonist, a village belle. I am not at liberty to reveal more details," she signs off.</text>

	<text>Real-life characters are increasingly serving as fodder for Malayalam movies of late. After Nivin Pauly's 'Jacobinte Swargarajyam', Kunchacko Boban's upcoming movie Kochuouvva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho has also borrowed elements from the life of a real person. In tune with its title, the film revolves around two characters  Kochuouvva played by Kunchacko Boban and Ayyappa Das portrayed by actor Sudheesh's son Master Rudraksh. The former plays a character who tries to fix others' problems. "My character Kochuouvva is based on a real person," says Kunchacko Boban. "If we actually mirror his real-life actions and generosity on screen, the audience would find it too cinematic. The irony is that we actually had to tone down his actions a bit for the film." While the actor doesn't reveal who the character is based on, he says that the movie has a fresh theme that would appeal to everyone. "The central characters in the movie have different aims in life but a particular incident unites their path towards these goals. Paulo Coelho's writings are what bring them together," explains the 'School Bus' actor. Incidentally, the film will once again have Kunchacko playing a rustic youth similar to the character in his latest release directed by Rishi Sivakumar. "While it has a serious theme at the core, director Sidhartha Siva has ensured that the film is made in a very entertaining way. It will be a refreshing movie, replete with songs and a lot of humour." 'Kochuouvva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho', which also has Aju Varghese and Suraj Venjaramoodu, has already finished two schedules and is currently waiting for the monsoons to hit to resume the shooting. However, the team is yet to zero in on the lead actress for the movie.</text>

	<text>It's well-known that anchor-actress Pearle Maaney is also an ace biker, who has displayed her skills both on small screen and in films like Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi. Soon, she will be getting a chance to perform stunts on her mean machine, in her upcoming movie Team Five, which has cricketer Sreesanth playing the lead. The film is directed and scripted by debutant Suresh Govind. "Pearle plays Aleena, who is a bubbly, sporty girl and is into biking," says the director. "She is a college student and her character brings in the twist and change of tone in the film. At the same time, she can't be termed a freak. Even in looks, she comes across as a normal girl. Also, the film showcases two phases in the life of her character. " The team would be shooting the biking sequences mostly in Bangalore, Goa and Fort Kochi. The film has two strong female protagonists, the other role being played by Nikki Galrani. Pearle, who is currently co-hosting a dance reality show says that she is all set to hone her biking skills. "I will have to train a bit for the role and learn stunts like wheelies, which professional stunt bikers often perform at shows. I am quite excited, but also tensed thinking whether I would end up hurting myself as the stunts aren't easy to pick up and would need some careful, focused training. 'Make sure there is enough of cotton stuffed around me,' I have told the team," she says. The actress is also excited to meet Sreesanth. "I have never met him before, but have heard that he is a wonderful artiste and an affable personality," she says.</text>

	<text>Another actor from Mollywood joins the police brigade, and this time it's Tovino Thomas , who will be donning the khaki and boots for the first time in his career with the upcoming Prithviraj-starrer Ezra. Its director Jaykrishnan tells us, "Tovino plays a prominent character in the movie. He will be seen as a police officer and is pivotal to the telling of the story." This will be the third time that Tovino is teaming up with Prithviraj , their most recent venture being Ennu Ninte Moideen. The ABCD actor says, "Prithviraj is like a brother to me and being part of his films has only helped me in my career. However, the reason I took up Ezra was because I really liked my character and the script, which is unlike any horror-thriller I have read or seen." Ezra already has Tamil actress Priya Anand , Pratap Pothen and Maheshinte Prathikaaram fame Sujith Sureshan lined up in its cast. Jaykrishnan has also roped in Bollywood actor Bharath Dabolkar, who has acted in movies such as Corporate and Company. "He is currently working in Kamal Haasan's Sabaash Naidu and will join our movie by next month," says Jaykrishnan, who has assisted several Bollywood directors including Rajkumar Santhoshi.</text>

The actress, who has always stood apart from the rest , off and on screen, says that it is her mother who has influenced her the most in life, be it in her life or career. "My mother has influenced me the most in my life. She was the one who taught me to have courage and strength, to be a confident individual and not get carried away by all that glitters," she says. ""She taught me to always stand on my own two feet and to be independent." Her mother is also the reason she is an actress today, Aparna adds. "She gifted me with the greatest present in my life by introducing me to the stage. I am who I am today, as a person and as a professional, because of my mom." However, despite all this, her mother still treats her like a baby, she admits. "She spoils me silly and gives in to all of my whims and fancies. She treats me like I am five years old even today and I wouldn't have it any other way."</text>

The actress is reportedly being considered for being the brand ambassador of the government's inter-caste marriage initiative. The social justice department will take a decision about this soon but there's a catch here; one that might put the government in difficulty. Read: 'Sairat' actress' fans bombard MH Minister with calls A recent meeting on the inter-caste marriage issue reportedly ended with the decision of sending the proposal to Rinku and her parents but an important thing to note is that Rinku is only 15 years old, well below the marriageable age in India for girls. Thus, making her a brand ambassador for a marriage-related project might not be the wisest thing to do.

	<text>SikhNet To Launch Free Online Animated Story for International Women's Day - in celebration of International Women's Day, SikhNet will launch an original short animated film, titled KAUR, free online. #makeithappen. #kaurpower. kaur.sikhnet.com. KAUR tells the story of a young Sikh girl, Saibhang Kaur, who loves science but feels the social pressure that "girls don't belong in science club." Not sure what to do about her dreams, Saibhang Kaur thinks about giving up. But when Saibhang's grandmother tells her the true story of the 18th century Sikh warrior princess Mai Bhago, Saibhang discovers her courage. The idea for KAUR began four years ago when SikhNet webmaster, Gurumustuk Singh Khalsa, wrote a blog article bemoaning how his daughter loved to imitate Disney princesses. He posed the question - wouldn't it be great for there to be an animated story about true-life, powerful 'princess' figures that his daughter could imitate, instead? Upon reading the blog post, an anonymous donor made a sizeable contribution to SikhNet, creating seed money for the project. SikhNet has produced over 100 original audio stories for kids. However, they had never produced an original animation before, so it took time for the company to decide what to do with the money. Four years later - the result is KAUR. KAUR focuses on two stories simultaneously. The story of a young girl who has to deal with the modern version of "women belong in the kitchen," and the story of Mai Bhago, an amazing Sikh woman warrior who led 40 men into battle against an army over 10,000 strong. This small band of Sikhs defended the principles of freedom and equality against a medieval version of ISIS. In KAUR, the story of Mai Bhago helps Saibhang Kaur find the strength to face the battles in her own life. SikhNet has chosen to launch the animation in celebration of International Women's Day. The struggles of Saibhang Kaur represent the struggles of so many young women around the world seeking to find a place for themselves beyond traditional roles. Mai Bhago is a true-life heroine, whose story can inspire all girls, everywhere. The animation will be available FREE online beginning on March 3rd at: kaur.sikhnet.com. It has a running time of approximately 20 minutes.

	<text>Rumours were rife that Ajith was to play a taxi driver in his next film directed by Siruthai Siva. However, we now hear that it is the leading lady of the film Shruti Haasan, who plays the role of a taxi driver and not Ajith. The actress has recently joined the set and now, the team has wrapped up the first schedule. A source from the unit says, "Shruti Haasan is kicked about her role. She plays a taxi driver, who drives in Kolkata. She is donning a khaki uniform too. She has recently shot in Chennai and the crew may travel to Kolkata for the next schedule of the film. So, it is Shruti who's playing the driver, not Ajith." Sources also say that a huge set that resembles certain places in Kolkata has been erected in Chennai. Apart from that, the team may head to Kolkata to shoot some of the scenes. During the month-long schedule, which concluded recently, Siva canned portions of Ajith and Lakshmi Menon. Shruti shot for just couple of days during this schedule and she will shoot for major portions of the film in the next schedule only.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON/KABUL: Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a rare US drone strike deep inside Pakistan, the Afghan spy agency announced on Sunday. Mansour's death is a body blow for the insurgents and removes a major obstacle to the fragile peace process in war-torn Afghanistan. Mansour and another militant were targeted by multiple unmanned aircraft operated by US Special Operations forces on Saturday as the duo rode in a vehicle in a remote area near the town of Ahmad Wal in the restive Baluchistan province close to the Afghan border, US officials said. Afghanistan's main spy agency said Mansour was killed in a US drone attack inside Pakistan. "Mansour was being closely monitored for a while ... until he was targeted along with other fighters aboard a vehicle ... in Balochistan," the National Directorate of Security said in a brief statement. Speaking to reporters in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw, US secretary of state John Kerry said, "Mansour posed ... an imminent threat to US personnel, Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces." Kerry said Mansour was also directly opposed to peace negotiations. The US "has long maintained that an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned reconciliation process is the surest way to ensure peace ... peace is what we want, Mansour was a threat to that," Kerry added. The Pentagon earlier confirmed it targeted Mansour, said to be in his early 50s, in an operation authorized by President Barack Obama. The deaths of Taliban leaders have sometimes been falsely reported. Mansour himself was said to have been killed last December. Mansour assumed the leadership in July 2015, replacing Taliban founder and the one-eyed reclusive long-time spiritual head Mullah Mohammad Omar in Pakistan in 2013. "Mansour has been the leader of the Taliban and actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners," said Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook. "Mansour has been an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, prohibiting Taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the Afghan government that could lead to an end to the conflict," he said. The drone strike inside Pakistan was a rare one since US Navy Seals killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden in a stealth raid in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in 2011. "Since the death of Mullah Omar and Mansour's assumption of leadership, the Taliban have conducted many attacks that have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces as well as numerous US and Coalition personnel," Cook said. The United States informed both Pakistan and Afghanistan shortly after the strike, a senior White House official said.</text>

	<text>PINEDALE (Wyoming): A woman and her four teenage daughters who were lured to a Utah house and tied up in the basement were thrilled and relieved to learn the father and son charged in the bizarre attack were in custody in Wyoming, authorities said. But despite their arrests, neither man was cooperating with investigators trying to learn more about what led up to the violence. Officers culminated a manhunt late Saturday night with the arrest of Dereck James "DJ" Harrison, 22, several hours after the surrender of his father, Flint Wayne Harrison, 51, the Sublette county sheriff's office said. The men face various charges stemming from the Tuesday attack in Centerville, Utah, including aggravated kidnapping and possession of a controlled substance. The younger Harrison was arrested without incident shortly after 10pm MDT, in the forested Half Moon Lake area of western Wyoming. He was booked into the county jail. He told the US Forest Service officer who arrested him that he had been hiding in the trees and brush most of the day until he saw a helicopter involved in the search and knew police were closing in, Centerville Lt Von Steenblik said. He walked toward officers who were manning a roadblock and surrendered, officials said. Police had said the younger Harrison was heavily armed with rifles and knives, but he was unarmed when authorities arrested him, the lieutenant said. His father turned himself in earlier in the day and had been helping authorities find his son. "This is an incredible end to a very stressful day," sheriff Stephen Haskell said. Meanwhile, authorities said the woman and her daughters are recovering after the attack Tuesday in Centerville, Utah. "They're very happy, very relieved, and just trying to move on," Steenblik said. The men are accused of tying the mother and daughters up with zip ties. When the elder Harrison hit the woman with a baseball bat, the teens began to break their ties and try to escape, according to charging documents. In the struggle that followed, one girl slapped away a shotgun pointed at her throat and another grabbed the bat and hit the son, police said. The victims managed to escape. The father and son had been using methamphetamine heavily over several days and falsely believed the woman had reported them to authorities, police said. Both have refused to talk to investigators since their arrests, Steenblik said. The younger Harrison was a close friend of the woman's family. He often visited the home for dinner or picked the girls up from school. The teens, aged 13 to 18, had known him for several years. The Harrisons fled and were eventually picked up by someone who took them to Salt Lake City, where they spent Tuesday night in a hotel. The elder Harrison is a registered sex offender. He surrendered in Pinedale for reasons still unknown to police.</text>

	<text>VIENNA: A gunman fired shots early today into a small crowd attending an open air concert organized by a local motorcycle club, killing two people and wounding 11 others before shooting himself to death, police said. Police said the overnight shooting in Austria's westernmost Voralberg province was preceded by a loud argument between the gunman and a woman in a nearby parking lot. The man then fetched a gun out of his car, left the parking lot and went to a field that was used as a concert venue, where he started shooting into the crowd of about 150 people, apparently at random. They said he killed himself after returning to the parking lot. The woman was not wounded in the shooting near Nenzing, a town about 40 kilometres east of Austria's border to Liechtenstein. State broadcaster ORF said the man apparently used a rifle or similar long weapon. Local media quoted rescue workers as saying some of the surviving victims were in serious condition. Police spokeswoman Susanne Dilp said she could not confirm that but described their wounds as "very diverse." She refused to name the motorcycle club but described it as "regional" rather than international. Dilp said no other details were available as police continued their investigation at the scene.</text>

	<text>PARIS: The girl, speaking in the lilting accent of southern France, appeared in government ads describing how she was recruited by Islamic State extremists during her quest for religion, then encouraged to quit school and go to Syria, and finally to plot a suicide attack against a synagogue at home. "I have a hard time even admitting now that I was indoctrinated," she says to the camera in the ad before breaking down, describing how she tried to recruit others. The teen, known as Lea, was meant to be the poster child of a nascent program in France aimed at de-radicalizing young people to stem their flow to Syria. But the jihadi rehab didn't work. Six times she reconnected with the extremists, and six times she called her counselor in tears to apologize. The seventh time, late in 2015, landed her in jail. France's effort is one of many around the world trying to break the hold Muslim radicals have on their recruits by figuring out what drew them to the groups in the first place. The United States has launched its first formal effort in Minnesota, on the orders of a federal judge. But it's not clear how effective the programs can be in the long term. France alone has nearly 2,000 people like Lea about 600 who have left for Syria, but far more who are involved in jihadi networks at home. Across Europe, an estimated 5,000 people have joined extremist fighters in Syria, and about a third of them have returned. Most, experts and government officials say, will cause no harm. Dounia Bouzar, who runs France's jihadi rehab program, works with more than 1,000 young people flagged as potential extremists. Lea's story, she said, is more the rule than the exception. Islamic State and al-Qaida extremists don't break off contact just because someone is caught and the young people themselves have a hard time pulling away from what she described as their 'online tribe.' "A young person who reconnects, that's normal," she said. "Monday, they come to bear witness and save others. Wednesday, they denounce someone who wants to leave and say, save him. And Friday, they re-connect and threaten your life." There is no reasoning with someone in the thrall of a jihadi group, those who run the program say, so the recruits have to experience tangible doubts about the jihadi promises they once believed. Bouzar said that can mean countering a message of anti-materialism by showing them the videos of fighters lounging in fancy villas or sporting watches with an Islamic State logo. Or finding someone who has returned from Syria to explain that instead of offering humanitarian aid, the extremists are taking over entire villages, sometimes lacing them with explosives. Only once doubts are seeded can young would-be jihadis themselves reason their way back to their former selves, she said. In the United States, a young Minnesota man who admitted he planned to go Syria to join the Islamic State group is among the first to take part in Minnesota's de-radicalization program, the first of its kind in the United States. In early 2014, just after turning 18, Abdullahi Mohamud Yusuf applied for a fast-track passport with a vague plan to go to Istanbul. He was stopped at the airport in May 2014, but remained free. He enrolled in community college, got a job, then was arrested in November that year on two terrorism charges for trying to join Islamic State. Yusuf, now 20, stayed in a halfway house while his case was pending and remained there after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He went back to jail after a box cutter was found beneath his bed. His lawyer says his client did not know anything about it. The program enlists the expertise of Daniel Koehler, a German researcher who works with would-be jihadis and their families. In the U.S., participants are already charged with terrorism offenses, and the goal is to assess their risk of backsliding and give them the tools to keep from slipping back into the networks that once drew them in. It's a form of psychological warfare, he said before leaving to evaluate the Minnesota suspects. What neither Koehler nor Bouzar will offer is immunity from charges. In the case of the Minnesota program, participants are already in the federal justice system. The program is initially being offered to Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. In France, Bouzar only deals with people who have not travelled to Syria. Nearly all the jihadis who return from the war zone are mostly voluntary and numbering around 250. The are jailed immediately. This is a sore subject for her, because, as she puts it "we just run after those who have repented" to offer the most persuasive arguments against joining. "I think the government is afraid of being manipulated," said Bouzar, who has an annual budget of around 600,000 euros ($676,000). "At the same time, I think for most of those who returned, it's because they saw the reality and it didn't correspond to their dreams. There's nothing better than someone who has escaped Daesh." That is why she placed so much hope in Lea's recovery, even though she knew the risk that Lea would reconnect with recruiters. One unexpected voice to emerge is that of Mourad Benchellali, a French former Guantanamo inmate cleared of terror links who now lectures to groups of young people throughout France and Belgium, including in Brussels' Molenbeek neighborhood, home to so many of the Paris and Brussels attackers. Benchellali, who was captured in 2001 after being misled into a trip that landed him in an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan, recounts his five years of imprisonment without rancor. And it's the lack of bitterness that may resonate the most. He has returned to the French prison where he was held after being released from Guantanamo, this time to persuade inmates not to turn to violent extremism. French prisons in particular have been pilloried as breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism. In Molenbeek, he has talked to a population of young people of immigrant backgrounds who feel cut off from mainstream Belgians. He said many in the West just think of violent punishment like beheading and cutting off hands when they hear about Islamic Sharia law. "The problem is that reality is more complicated. Sharia is above all a complete system. It's a political system, a judicial system, an entire system. Everyone has a role to play," Benchellali said at a recent round table on radicalization. "So they have a real alternative. It's not just getting married. They're being offered an entire new life when they arrive. They get a new worth." That is especially true for those already caught up in a spiral of crime, unemployment and alienation, said Steve Lambert, a Brussels lawyer linked to jihadi cases. "Carrying out an attack is an exit strategy by default, after being closed off by all the failures you've caused in your life," Lambert said. "Nothing is simple and there are no absolutes, but there has to be a solution," he added. "Every time we harden ourselves, we create new martyrs for the cause." Finding out what motivates the slide into violent extremism is crucial to instilling doubts and ultimately changing minds, as is a risk assessment, said Koehler, who has worked directly with several dozen families in six countries. The French de-radicalization sessions are conducted in rented rooms, the five participants only told the location 10 minutes in advance because, Bouzar said, Islamic State recruiters "are hounding them, trying to geo-locate us. No cellphones are allowed." In Minnesota, the program started in April with risk evaluations of Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terror charges. Koehler evaluated their level of engagement in terror activities and chances of relapsing, and the federal judge overseeing their cases will use that information and other factors to determine their sentences. Koehler will also come up with recommendations, such as counseling or mentoring, to keep these men on the right track. The judge could use those recommendations as conditions of the men's parole meaning they could be taken back into custody if they don't follow the program. In March, U.S. District Judge Michael Davis said the program could also be expanded to other terror defendants, including those being released from prison and re-entering society. The goal is to keep the community safe while helping the young men become productive members of society. Koehler will also train U.S. probation and pretrial officers, who will be responsible for supervising the defendants once they are out of prison. But on the minds of law enforcement are cases like that of a young Frenchman known as Abu Oussama, seen in extraordinary hidden camera footage captured by an undercover documentary filmmaker. Flagged to police by his father, detained in Turkey trying to reach Syria, he was imprisoned in France for five months until authorities determined he was no longer a danger, he says. Yet the young man says he is plotting an attack on his homeland. "They said since I was de-radicalized, since I was quiet..." he says, giggling toward the camera he cannot see. "It's all part of the ruse, brother."</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: The country head of al-Qaida in Pakistan, Tayyab Nawaz alias Hafiz Abdul Mateen, was killed during an armed offensive by police in the country's east Multan city. Al-Qaida commander was gunned down with his seven other accomplices on Thursday night when police raided a hideout of suspected militants at the river bank of Multan, a main district in the country's east Punjab province, Xinhua quoted Dawn News as saying. Police said that the militants were holding a meeting to carry out an attack at a prominent university in the city, when the cops conducted the raid by acting on an intelligence tip-off. The bodies of the killed militants were shifted to Nishtar Hospital of Multan for investigations and autopsy where Mateen was identified. The resident of northwest Dera Ismail Khan area, the commander was wanted in pertaining to murder of a senior army officer and attack on Parade Lane bombing in the country's east Punjab province on December 4, 2009 in which 36 people were killed. Police in Multan region issued a threat, following the killing of the militants, saying that the al-Qaida could target educational institutes in Punjab where security needed to be beefed up.</text>

	<text>LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron said he would be happy to meet Donald Trump if he becomes the Republican presidential candidate. But the British leader repeated his claim that Trump's proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States is "wrong and divisive" and "a very dangerous thing to say". Asked on the 'Peston on Sunday' show if he'd meet Trump, Cameron responded, "I don't know". He added, "American presidential candidates have made a habit of coming through Europe and through the U.K., and if that happens I'd be very happy to." Trump had said last week that he was "not going to have a very good relationship" with Cameron, though he later backtracked and even said the prime minister had invited him to visit 10 Downing Street.</text>

	<text>LA PAZ: Bolivia braved criticism from Christian churches to enact a gender identity law allowing transsexual and transgender people to change their name, sex and photo on official and private documents. "Today we've put an end to a history of social proscription," Vice President Alvaro Garcia yesterday said as he enacted the legislation in place of President Evo Morales , who was visiting Cuba. Transgender people "are a reality," he said. "It is social hypocrisy to deny their existence." Bolivia's legislature passed the law on Friday, despite protests from Catholic and Evangelical churches demanding more debate. The Catholic Church had said it rejected the text because it undermines family and societal "norms." An Evangelical church leader, pastor Sergio Gutierrez, had called for a national referendum on the issue. But Garcia yesterday pointed to an interview last year in which Pope Francis said transsexuals were also children of God and that they should be accepted by the Church as such. "If the pope says that, who are we to judge and to deny someone who wants to modify their sexual identity?" Garcia asked. LGBT associations welcomed the law. "We can see we are in a new state able to integrate each of these people who were vilified and who had no rights," said Tamara Nunez, a representative of a transsexual collective. "Identity is the first fundamental right."</text>

	<text>DUBAI: A woman was fined and ordered to be deported from the United Arab Emirates for breaching her husband's privacy by checking his cell phone to see if he was cheating on her, Gulf News reported on Wednesday. The unnamed Arab expatriate was fined 150,000 dirhams ($40,843) by the criminal court in the emirate of Ajman, the English-language newspaper said. Her lawyer told the paper she had accused her husband of having an affair. She admitted she had accessed his phone without his permission and transferred photos to her device, the lawyer added. The husband lodged a complaint with the court which convicted her on Thursday last week under a cybercrime law which penalises "the invasion of privacy of another person" using information technology, the paper said.

	<text>KABUL: Afghan authorities scrambled on Sunday to confirm the fate of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour after US officials said he was likely killed in drone strikes -- a potential blow to the resurgent militant movement. The Taliban have not commented officially on the very rare US attack deep inside Pakistan on Saturday, authorised by President Barack Obama, which could scupper any immediate prospect of peace talks. The apparent elimination of Mansour, who had consolidated power following a bitter Taliban leadership struggle over the past year, could also spark new succession battles within the fractious movement. "Mansour was the target and was likely killed" in the remote Pakistani town of Ahmad Wal in Balochistan province by multiple unmanned aircraft operated by US special forces, an American official said Saturday. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's office on Sunday confirmed the strike, adding that they were investigating whether Mansour had in fact been killed. The deaths of Taliban leaders have often been falsely reported. Mansour himself was rumoured to have been killed last December. "The Afghan government is trying to gather details regarding the fate of Mullah Mansour," the presidential palace said in a statement. "This drone strike shows that terrorists fuelling conflict will not be safe anywhere." Two Pakistani intelligence officials told AFP the drones struck a Toyota Corolla near the city of Quetta, killing two people whose bodies were burned beyond recognition. They did not confirm whether Mansour was among them but said the bodies had been moved to a hospital in Quetta. A member of the Quetta Shura, the Taliban's leadership council, told AFP that Mansour had been unreachable on his mobile phone since Saturday night. "We are not sure if something is really wrong or he purposely switched off his phone fearing an attack," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. Mansour was formally appointed head of the Taliban in July last year following the revelation that the group's founder Mullah Omar had been dead for two years. The group saw a resurgence under the firebrand supremo with striking military victories, helping to cement his authority by burnishing his credentials as a commander. The Taliban briefly captured the strategic northern city of Kunduz last September in their most spectacular victory in 14 years. The southern opium-rich province of Helmand is also almost entirely under insurgent control. "Mansour posed... an imminent threat to US personnel, Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces," US Secretary of State John Kerry said during a visit to Myanmar Sunday. "He was also directly opposed to peace negotiations." But Mansour's apparent death was not immediately seen as likely to push the Taliban closer to peace talks. It could press them to show they are still able to wage an aggressive battle, observers say. "The war has been going on for so long, the Taliban has so many leaders and so much ability to function at the local level even without strong central guidance, that we would be well advised to keep expectations in check," said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution think-tank. The drone attack came just days after representatives from the US, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan held another round of negotiations in Islamabad aimed at reviving long-stalled direct peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. However pressure has been building in recent months for the United States to return to direct attacks on the Taliban, particularly via air strikes. NATO ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in December 2014, pulling out the bulk of its troops, although a 13,000-strong residual force remains for training and counterterrorism operations. The Taliban, who announced the start of their annual spring offensive last month, have already stepped up their campaign against the Western-backed Kabul government for the season. If Mansour's death is confirmed, his two newly named deputies -- influential religious leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and Sirajuddin Haqqani -- could likely step up to fill the power vacuum. Omar's son Mullah Yakoub, although deemed young and inexperienced, is also favoured by some Taliban commanders for the leader's post.</text>

	<text>SENDAI: Britain's possible exit from the European Union took centre stage at a G7 meeting in Japan on Saturday, as UK finance minister George Osborne warned a 'Brexit' could doom trade deals with EU countries. The comments came during two days of talks largely focused on how the club of rich nations can stoke the lumbering world economy, with terrorism financing and a sharp divide over currency policy also on the table. As the vote on Britain's future in the EU draws closer, Osborne said his meetings with G7 counterparts underscored the gravity of the in-out decision next month. "If Britain left the EU, and wanted access to the single market... then we would need to pay into the EU budget and we'd have to accept free movement of people but we'd have no say over those policies at all," Osborne told the BBC. Britain will decide in a referendum on June 23 whether to stay in the EU or leave the 28-country bloc. Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne, like Prime Minister David Cameron, is campaigning for Britain to stay in. "If we left the EU we would have a two year period to negotiate our exit with 27 other countries, we'd then have to negotiate new arrangements... and at the same time conclude over 50 trade deals with countries that aren't even in Europe," he said. "That would be extremely difficult to do." During that period, businesses would have "no certainty" about the future and so would not take on new workers or invest, he said. "It hits people's incomes, it hits the value of houses, it hits businesses and jobs. People are beginning to understand that," said Osborne. European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, attending the meetings at a famous hot spring resort in northern Japan, said the G7 - which also includes the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - backed Britain remaining in the EU. "It is obvious that all the partners around the table want Great Britain to stay inside the EU and we are all aware that the situation would be bad, it would be a loss" if it left, Moscovici said. "We have no 'plan B'. When you start having a 'plan B' it means that you don't believe in your plan A. There is just one plan: the United Kingdom inside a united Europe." With just over a month to the vote, the "Remain" camp is on 55 per cent and the "Leave" campaign on 45 per cent, according to the What UK Thinks website's average of the last six opinion polls.</text>

	<text>PARIS: The girl, speaking in the lilting accent of southern France, appeared in government ads describing how she was recruited by Islamic State extremists during her quest for religion, then encouraged to quit school and go to Syria, and finally to plot a suicide attack against a synagogue at home. "I have a hard time even admitting now that I was indoctrinated," she says to the camera in the ad before breaking down, describing how she tried to recruit others. The teen, known as Lea, was meant to be the poster child of a nascent program in France aimed at de-radicalizing young people to stem their flow to Syria. But the jihadi rehab didn't work. Six times she reconnected with the extremists, and six times she called her counselor in tears to apologize. The seventh time, late in 2015, landed her in jail. France's effort is one of many around the world trying to break the hold Muslim radicals have on their recruits by figuring out what drew them to the groups in the first place. The United States has launched its first formal effort in Minnesota, on the orders of a federal judge. But it's not clear how effective the programs can be in the long term. France alone has nearly 2,000 people like Lea about 600 who have left for Syria, but far more who are involved in jihadi networks at home. Across Europe, an estimated 5,000 people have joined extremist fighters in Syria, and about a third of them have returned. Most, experts and government officials say, will cause no harm. Dounia Bouzar, who runs France's jihadi rehab program, works with more than 1,000 young people flagged as potential extremists. Lea's story, she said, is more the rule than the exception. Islamic State and al-Qaida extremists don't break off contact just because someone is caught and the young people themselves have a hard time pulling away from what she described as their 'online tribe.' "A young person who reconnects, that's normal," she said. "Monday, they come to bear witness and save others. Wednesday, they denounce someone who wants to leave and say, save him. And Friday, they re-connect and threaten your life." There is no reasoning with someone in the thrall of a jihadi group, those who run the program say, so the recruits have to experience tangible doubts about the jihadi promises they once believed. Bouzar said that can mean countering a message of anti-materialism by showing them the videos of fighters lounging in fancy villas or sporting watches with an Islamic State logo. Or finding someone who has returned from Syria to explain that instead of offering humanitarian aid, the extremists are taking over entire villages, sometimes lacing them with explosives. Only once doubts are seeded can young would-be jihadis themselves reason their way back to their former selves, she said. In the United States, a young Minnesota man who admitted he planned to go Syria to join the Islamic State group is among the first to take part in Minnesota's de-radicalization program, the first of its kind in the United States. In early 2014, just after turning 18, Abdullahi Mohamud Yusuf applied for a fast-track passport with a vague plan to go to Istanbul. He was stopped at the airport in May 2014, but remained free. He enrolled in community college, got a job, then was arrested in November that year on two terrorism charges for trying to join Islamic State. Yusuf, now 20, stayed in a halfway house while his case was pending and remained there after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He went back to jail after a box cutter was found beneath his bed. His lawyer says his client did not know anything about it. The program enlists the expertise of Daniel Koehler, a German researcher who works with would-be jihadis and their families. In the U.S., participants are already charged with terrorism offenses, and the goal is to assess their risk of backsliding and give them the tools to keep from slipping back into the networks that once drew them in. It's a form of psychological warfare, he said before leaving to evaluate the Minnesota suspects. What neither Koehler nor Bouzar will offer is immunity from charges. In the case of the Minnesota program, participants are already in the federal justice system. The program is initially being offered to Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. In France, Bouzar only deals with people who have not travelled to Syria. Nearly all the jihadis who return from the war zone are mostly voluntary and numbering around 250. The are jailed immediately. This is a sore subject for her, because, as she puts it "we just run after those who have repented" to offer the most persuasive arguments against joining. "I think the government is afraid of being manipulated," said Bouzar, who has an annual budget of around 600,000 euros ($676,000). "At the same time, I think for most of those who returned, it's because they saw the reality and it didn't correspond to their dreams. There's nothing better than someone who has escaped Daesh." That is why she placed so much hope in Lea's recovery, even though she knew the risk that Lea would reconnect with recruiters. One unexpected voice to emerge is that of Mourad Benchellali, a French former Guantanamo inmate cleared of terror links who now lectures to groups of young people throughout France and Belgium, including in Brussels' Molenbeek neighborhood, home to so many of the Paris and Brussels attackers. Benchellali, who was captured in 2001 after being misled into a trip that landed him in an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan, recounts his five years of imprisonment without rancor. And it's the lack of bitterness that may resonate the most. He has returned to the French prison where he was held after being released from Guantanamo, this time to persuade inmates not to turn to violent extremism. French prisons in particular have been pilloried as breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism. In Molenbeek, he has talked to a population of young people of immigrant backgrounds who feel cut off from mainstream Belgians. He said many in the West just think of violent punishment like beheading and cutting off hands when they hear about Islamic Sharia law. "The problem is that reality is more complicated. Sharia is above all a complete system. It's a political system, a judicial system, an entire system. Everyone has a role to play," Benchellali said at a recent round table on radicalization. "So they have a real alternative. It's not just getting married. They're being offered an entire new life when they arrive. They get a new worth." That is especially true for those already caught up in a spiral of crime, unemployment and alienation, said Steve Lambert, a Brussels lawyer linked to jihadi cases. "Carrying out an attack is an exit strategy by default, after being closed off by all the failures you've caused in your life," Lambert said. "Nothing is simple and there are no absolutes, but there has to be a solution," he added. "Every time we harden ourselves, we create new martyrs for the cause." Finding out what motivates the slide into violent extremism is crucial to instilling doubts and ultimately changing minds, as is a risk assessment, said Koehler, who has worked directly with several dozen families in six countries. The French de-radicalization sessions are conducted in rented rooms, the five participants only told the location 10 minutes in advance because, Bouzar said, Islamic State recruiters "are hounding them, trying to geo-locate us. No cellphones are allowed." In Minnesota, the program started in April with risk evaluations of Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terror charges. Koehler evaluated their level of engagement in terror activities and chances of relapsing, and the federal judge overseeing their cases will use that information and other factors to determine their sentences. Koehler will also come up with recommendations, such as counseling or mentoring, to keep these men on the right track. The judge could use those recommendations as conditions of the men's parole meaning they could be taken back into custody if they don't follow the program. In March, U.S. District Judge Michael Davis said the program could also be expanded to other terror defendants, including those being released from prison and re-entering society. The goal is to keep the community safe while helping the young men become productive members of society. Koehler will also train U.S. probation and pretrial officers, who will be responsible for supervising the defendants once they are out of prison. But on the minds of law enforcement are cases like that of a young Frenchman known as Abu Oussama, seen in extraordinary hidden camera footage captured by an undercover documentary filmmaker. Flagged to police by his father, detained in Turkey trying to reach Syria, he was imprisoned in France for five months until authorities determined he was no longer a danger, he says. Yet the young man says he is plotting an attack on his homeland. "They said since I was de-radicalized, since I was quiet..." he says, giggling toward the camera he cannot see. "It's all part of the ruse, brother."</text>

	<text>China's government fabricates about 488 million social media comments a year - nearly the same as one day of Twitter's total global volume - in a massive effort to distract its citizens from bad news and sensitive political debates, according to a study. Three scholars led by Gary King, a political scientist at Harvard University who specialises in using quantitative data to analyse public policy, ran the first systematic study of China's online propaganda workers, known as the Fifty Cent Party because they are popularly believed to be paid by the government 50 Chinese cents for every social media post. Contrary to popular perception inside China, the Fifty Cent Party avoids engaging in debates with critics and doesn't make fun of foreign governments. Instead, it mostly works to distract public attention away from hot topics by highlighting the positive, cheering the state, symbols of the regime, or the Communist Party's revolutionary past. Although those who post comments are often rumored to be ordinary citizens, the researchers were surprised to find that nearly all the posts were written by workers at government agencies including tax and human resource departments, and at courts. The team based their findings on leaked archives of 2013 and 2014 e-mails from the Internet Propaganda Office of Zhanggong, a county-level district of nearly half a million people in Ganzhou City, in Jiangxi, a province in southeast China King and his team pulled out 2,341 e-mails of which more than half contained a Fifty Cent post, totaling 43,797 posts that formed a benchmark for identifying other propaganda posts. They were able to identify Fifty Centers by cross referencing names from leaked e-mails with online social media profiles.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Sunday that no theory was being favoured on why the EgyptAir MS804 plunged into the Mediterranean Sea and that Egypt was using a submarine to locate the black boxes. The Airbus A320 carrying 66 people had crashed into the sea while flying from Paris to Cairo early on Thursday, and some wreckage has been found. However, the black boxes are still missing. Egypt's aviation minister had said that terrorism was a more likely reason than technical failure, but Sisi said in a televised address that "all the theories are possible". He added, "There is no particular theory we can affirm right now." Sisi said a submarine that could operate at a depth of 9,800 feet under sea level had been deployed on Sunday to search for the black boxes. "This (submarine) moved today in the direction of the plane crash because we are working hard to retrieve the two boxes, which are the black boxes," he said. A civil aviation official had on Sunday said that search teams had found none of the passengers' bodies.</text>

	<text>BEIRUT: A key rebel supply route to Aleppo has been the latest target of Russian warplanes in the latest round of ceasefire which has been on going since February, a monitoring group has said. "The Russian and Syrian warplanes together carried out at least 40 air strikes on the Castello road," Syrian Observatory for Human Rights chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. "They are the heaviest air strikes there since February, and they are also the first confirmed Russian strikes since the truce began," Abdel Rahman said. The violence wracking Aleppo city over the past month has killed some 300 civilians and left world powers scrambling to save the fragile truce brokered by the United States and Russia nearly three months ago. The northern city once Syria's commercial powerhouse is divided between rebel groups in the east and regime forces in the west. The Castello road is a key supply route for rebels leading north out of Aleppo. Even while the rest of the city witnessed relative calm in the first few weeks of the truce, fierce fighting has raged for the highway. On Friday, Moscow proposed joint air strikes with Washington against jihadists in Syria from Wednesday, but its offer was spurned. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since last September in support of its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Washington launched its air war against the Islamic State group and other jihadists in Syria in 2014. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said the US military does "not collaborate or coordinate with the Russians on any operations in Syria." US State Department spokesman John Kirby said nothing had been agreed with Moscow as its ally Damascus was responsible for the "vast majority" of violations of the February ceasefire. Russia's intervention has significantly strengthened the Syrian government in the five-year-old civil war that has killed more than 270,000 people and driven millions from their homes.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON/KABUL: Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a rare US drone strike deep inside Pakistan, the Afghan spy agency announced on Sunday. Mansour's death is a body blow for the insurgents and removes a major obstacle to the fragile peace process in war-torn Afghanistan. Mansour and another militant were targeted by multiple unmanned aircraft operated by US Special Operations forces on Saturday as the duo rode in a vehicle in a remote area near the town of Ahmad Wal in the restive Baluchistan province close to the Afghan border, US officials said. Afghanistan's main spy agency said Mansour was killed in a US drone attack inside Pakistan. "Mansour was being closely monitored for a while ... until he was targeted along with other fighters aboard a vehicle ... in Balochistan," the National Directorate of Security said in a brief statement. Speaking to reporters in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw, US secretary of state John Kerry said, "Mansour posed ... an imminent threat to US personnel, Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces." Kerry said Mansour was also directly opposed to peace negotiations. The US "has long maintained that an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned reconciliation process is the surest way to ensure peace ... peace is what we want, Mansour was a threat to that," Kerry added. The Pentagon earlier confirmed it targeted Mansour, said to be in his early 50s, in an operation authorized by President Barack Obama. The deaths of Taliban leaders have sometimes been falsely reported. Mansour himself was said to have been killed last December. Mansour assumed the leadership in July 2015, replacing Taliban founder and the one-eyed reclusive long-time spiritual head Mullah Mohammad Omar in Pakistan in 2013. "Mansour has been the leader of the Taliban and actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners," said Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook. "Mansour has been an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, prohibiting Taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the Afghan government that could lead to an end to the conflict," he said. The drone strike inside Pakistan was a rare one since US Navy Seals killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden in a stealth raid in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in 2011. "Since the death of Mullah Omar and Mansour's assumption of leadership, the Taliban have conducted many attacks that have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces as well as numerous US and Coalition personnel," Cook said. The United States informed both Pakistan and Afghanistan shortly after the strike, a senior White House official said.</text>

	<text>Ranchi: "Sitaram Yechury made a historic mistake in tying up with the Congress in West Bengal ,'' BJP MP MJ Akbar said here on Friday. Describing the debut of the BJP in Assam as a massive endorsement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, Akbar said that the CPM under Yechury has repeated the same blunder the Communist Party of India made in 1969. Founder of CPI, Shripad Amrit Dange had to face a lot of flak at that time for supporting the Congress. "At least at that time the Congress had a leader like Indira Gandhi. But Yechury committed a crime by forging a jote (alliance) with the Congress under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi which is why the CPM was routed in West Bengal,'' said Akbar. Akbar who was here in connection with the Modi government completing two years at the Centre said that the Prime Minister has brought about an economic revolution in the country, breaking away from the tradition of conventional economy. "Though poverty alleviation is a constitutional requirement, Modi in his first speech in Parliament had said that the age of poverty alleviation was over and it was now an era of poverty elimination,'' he said. Modi's agenda is to raise the economy of the poor, said Akbar claiming that the Jan dhan Yojna has come as a major setback to the chit funds across the nation. He was also all praise for chief minister Raghubar Das for the victory of BJP in Godda by-election in Jharkhand , the result of which were declared on Thursday. "The result was proof of the good work that the chief minister has started in the state." It is certainly due to the dynamic leadership of the Prime Minister who has shown us the way to development, but it is the chief minister who is getting them executed, he said.</text>

	<text>PINEDALE (Wyoming): A woman and her four teenage daughters who were lured to a Utah house and tied up in the basement were thrilled and relieved to learn the father and son charged in the bizarre attack were in custody in Wyoming, authorities said. But despite their arrests, neither man was cooperating with investigators trying to learn more about what led up to the violence. Officers culminated a manhunt late Saturday night with the arrest of Dereck James "DJ" Harrison, 22, several hours after the surrender of his father, Flint Wayne Harrison, 51, the Sublette county sheriff's office said. The men face various charges stemming from the Tuesday attack in Centerville, Utah, including aggravated kidnapping and possession of a controlled substance. The younger Harrison was arrested without incident shortly after 10pm MDT, in the forested Half Moon Lake area of western Wyoming. He was booked into the county jail. He told the US Forest Service officer who arrested him that he had been hiding in the trees and brush most of the day until he saw a helicopter involved in the search and knew police were closing in, Centerville Lt Von Steenblik said. He walked toward officers who were manning a roadblock and surrendered, officials said. Police had said the younger Harrison was heavily armed with rifles and knives, but he was unarmed when authorities arrested him, the lieutenant said. His father turned himself in earlier in the day and had been helping authorities find his son. "This is an incredible end to a very stressful day," sheriff Stephen Haskell said. Meanwhile, authorities said the woman and her daughters are recovering after the attack Tuesday in Centerville, Utah. "They're very happy, very relieved, and just trying to move on," Steenblik said. The men are accused of tying the mother and daughters up with zip ties. When the elder Harrison hit the woman with a baseball bat, the teens began to break their ties and try to escape, according to charging documents. In the struggle that followed, one girl slapped away a shotgun pointed at her throat and another grabbed the bat and hit the son, police said. The victims managed to escape. The father and son had been using methamphetamine heavily over several days and falsely believed the woman had reported them to authorities, police said. Both have refused to talk to investigators since their arrests, Steenblik said. The younger Harrison was a close friend of the woman's family. He often visited the home for dinner or picked the girls up from school. The teens, aged 13 to 18, had known him for several years. The Harrisons fled and were eventually picked up by someone who took them to Salt Lake City, where they spent Tuesday night in a hotel. The elder Harrison is a registered sex offender. He surrendered in Pinedale for reasons still unknown to police.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A mother cannot name her daughter 'Cyanide', a British court has ruled in a landmark case, saying her unusual choice might harm her children. The woman, who also chose the name Preacher for the girl's twin brother, insisted that she had a right to name her own children. But the mother, from Powys, Wales, was thwarted by top judges on Thursday. In the first case of its kind, appeal court judges ruled that it was an "extreme" case and that the mother's "unusual" choices might harm her children. The mother has a chaotic history of mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse and relationships with abusive men, said Lady Justice King. The twins, who are infants, and two of their half-siblings are now living with foster parents, Wales Online reported. When Powys county council social workers learnt of the names the mother had chosen for the twins, they took the case to court in an unprecedented step. In June last year, a judge issued an injunction against the mother, forbidding her from formally registering the twins' unorthodox forenames. Her lawyers appealed, insisting that the refusal to let her name her own children violated her right to respect for family life. Lady Justice King, sitting with Lady Justice Gloster and Lord Justice David Richards, said that naming a little girl after a "notorious poison" was simply unacceptable. Although there was nothing seriously objectionable about the name Preacher, she ruled that both twins' names should be chosen by their older half-siblings. While ruling in the landmark case, the judge said that "even allowing for changes in taste, fashion and developing individual perception," Cyanide was a very odd name to give to a baby girl. The mother said Preacher was a "rather cool name" which sent a "strong spiritual" message and which would "stand my son well for the future". Cyanide, she said, was a "lovely, pretty name" and had positive connotations as the poison which ended the lives of both Hitler and his aide Paul Goebbels. Justice King said the courts would intervene to prevent a parent naming a child "in only the most extreme cases". But she ruled, "This is one of those rare cases where the court should intervene to protect the girl twin from emotional harm that I am satisfied she would suffer if called Cyanide."</text>

	<text>Critics of Portugal's culture minister are calling on him to be fired for doing something, well, uncultured. After being called "incompetent" and promoting a "work style of chronyism, domineering and rudeness", culture minister Joao Soares reckoned it was time to slap two columnists at an influential newspaper. "I see that I do have to find him (columnist Augusto Seabra), and now also Vasco Pulido Valente, to give them some sound slapping. It will be good for them. And for me," Soares wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. Sergio Azevedo, deputy bench leader for the main opposition Social Democrats, said Soares' remarks were incompatible with the government job. "There's only one way for him. Out," he wrote on the same social network. The original post garnered over 800 mostly critical comments with many calling for his resignation. The ministry would not comment and Soares, son of former prime minister and president Mario Soares, was not reachable.</text>

	<text>A Texas county jail inmate who escaped custody while receiving treatment in a hospital was found in the dishwasher of his girlfriend's apartment in boxer shorts and wearing handcuffs with the chain severed, a sheriff's department said on Thursday. "He took out the racks and made himself a nice cubby hole," said chief deputy Glenn Blank of the Jasper county sheriff's office in East Texas. The inmate, Wesley Evans, 20, was captured on Wednesday morning and was taken back into custody after an escape that lasted about 24 hours. He is expected to face charges for the escape attempt. Evans has been in jail since March 8 on charges of aggravated robbery, auto theft and arson. He was taken to the hospital for treatment of a swollen hand.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump appears to have a passionate supporter in Joseph Hornick, a New Jersey man who faces a $2,000 fine or 90 days in jail for flying a flag emblazoned with the billionaire candidate's name over his home. Local officials said the flag violates an ordinance prohibiting the display of political signs more than 30 days ahead of an election and issued him a summons. New Jersey's primary is on June 7. For weeks, Hornick has displayed the blue flag with Trump's "Make America Great Again!" campaign slogan on a pole outside his two-story West Long Branch house, at a busy intersection near Monmouth University, in a show of his support for Trump. Trump has been campaigning this week in neighboring New York in an effort to snag the Republican presidential nomination. Despite being issued a summons on March 25 for the violation, Hornick apparently intends to keep it up. "The fine can be in the Millions of dollars! That flag will never come down!" he wrote in a defiant Facebook post. Hornick did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lori Cole, West Long Branch's clerk, said on Friday that Hornick, 54, could also face 90 days in jail as a maximum penalty if a judge determines he is in violation of the law. "It just came up recently," she said of the controversy. Brian Hegarty, a former Democratic Party councilman, complained to authorities about Hornick's flag, according to a March 25 police report. Hegarty told police that he had complained several times about the flag to a code enforcement official, but no action was taken. Sergeant James Gomez in the report said Hornick initially agreed to take down the flag before speaking with his attorney. "He advised on the advice of an attorney he would not be removing the flag and would fight any summons issued to him," Gomez wrote. Hornick is scheduled to appear in court on April 20.</text>

	<text>DUBAI: A mother of six in Saudi Arabia has burnt her house after learning that her husband had gone abroad for a second honeymoon, a media report said today. The woman, who has been married for 10 years, was shocked to receive a text message from her husband, that he married a second wife and was travelling abroad with her for their honeymoon, Gulf News reported. In a fit of rage, she set her home in Jazan port city on fire. However, when she saw the house being engulfed by the blaze, she raised an alarm for assistance from her neighbours, Saudi news website Al Sada reported. The fire was doused by the fire brigade. A fire official said that one child, reportedly aged five, was harmed in the blaze. The case was referred to the police for investigation.</text>

	<text>CLEVELAND: The Ohio childhood home of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, available for rent in time for the Republican National Convention this summer, could have been had for $8,000 a month until Friday afternoon, when the price went up and references to the infamous criminal came down. The home where Dahmer grew up and in 1978 committed his first murder is in Bath, Ohio, 26 miles south of Cleveland, where the convention is scheduled to be held in July. The listing on a real-estate company website initially included a reference to Dahmer but on Friday that was removed and the price had been increased to $10,000 a month. Dahmer was convicted in 1992 in the murder and dismemberment of 17 boys and men, some of whom he ate, over a period of 14 years. He was beaten to death in 1994 by another prison inmate while serving 15 life terms in Wisconsin, where most of the murders took place after he moved there. The listing by Howard Hanna, the official real estate broker for the convention, had been up since February and initially included the fact that the three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 2,170-square-foot home was once occupied by Dahmer. It had described the house as a "mid-century modern home with a true park-like setting. Smoking and animals okay. This is Jeffrey Dahmer's childhood home. Close to Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Montrose shopping. Easy access to I-77 highway." By Friday afternoon, the Dahmer sentence had been removed. Julia Domenick, the listing agent at Hanna, could not be reached for comment. In 1978, at age 18, Dahmer killed a teenaged hitchhiker, then dismembered and buried the body in a shallow grave behind the Bath house. Homeowner Chris Butler, a member of the Akron-based punk band The Waitresses, bought the house in 2005 for $295,000 after its history was disclosed. He could not be reached for comment.</text>

	<text>A high-tech marine drone scouring the depths of Scotland's Loch Ness for one of nature's most elusive beasts has found a "monster"  but not the one it was looking for. Rather than the fabled Loch Ness Monster itself, the probe has discovered a 30-foot (9 metre) replica used in the 1970 film "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes", which sank nearly 50 years ago after its buoyant humps were removed. Undeterred, the enthusiastic monster-hunters steering the drone are continuing their two-week search for any evidence that might prove the existence of "Nessie". The survey by Norwegian company Kongsberg Maritime has been the most detailed to date of the Loch's icy depths. The Munin drone is capable of mapping vast areas down to 1,500 feet and is often used to locate downed aircraft. "The vehicle allows sonars to scan just a few metres from the loch floor, giving resolution several orders of magnitude greater than anything before," said Kongsberg Maritime engineer Craig Wallace. Along with the movie replica, it has also found a 27-foot shipwreck as it maps the Loch floor. Far from being disappointed by the findings, Steve Feltham who has been hunting Nessie for 25 years, says the maps will help him in his quest. "I think the findings are fantastic," he said. "We now have a more detailed map of the rock bottom than ever before, which will show us the location of every lump and bump. "We can send back cameras to look at anything of interest which could turn out to be the carcass of the animal," he added. "It's shown there's a hell of a lot more to investigate." The first written record of a monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is said to have banished a "water beast" to the depths of the River Ness in the 6th century. The most famous picture of Nessie, known as the "surgeon's photo", was taken in 1934 and showed a head on a long neck emerging from the water. It was revealed 60 years later to have been a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine. Countless unsuccessful attempts to track down the monster have been made in the years since, notably in 2003 when the BBC funded an extensive scientific search that used 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking to sweep the full length of the loch. It concluded there was probably nothing there.</text>

	<text>AUSTIN (Texas): A flight attendant deployed an emergency evacuation slide on an airplane after it arrived in Houston and used it to exit a plane packed with passengers, an airline official said. "It is our understanding that she deployed it intentionally," said United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart, adding airline officials have been speaking with the flight attendant to see why she deployed the slide in the incident that took place on Monday. In a video shown on Houston TV station KPRC, the flight attendant tosses her bag out of a door behind the cockpit and slides down the slide. She grabs the bag and walks away from the plane, which was at full stop. A photo of the airplane on the station's website shows it at the gate, with the slide deployed on the side opposite of the gate. The flight, with 159 passengers and six crew members aboard, was from Sacramento to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The airplane, a Boeing 737-900, was briefly taken out of service for maintenance and then was returned to its scheduled use. The flight attendant, who was not identified by the airline, has been removed from flying duties. All the others aboard exited the plane without incident or injury.</text>

	<text>BANGKOK: A Thai woman has been charged with sedition, police said on Tuesday, after photos were spread of her holding a red bowl allegedly bearing a message from an ex-premier who lies at the heart of the kingdom's bitter politics. The images showed Theerawan Charoensuk, 54, holding a hand-sized bowl with a goodwill note apparently signed by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose powerful political dynasty is locked in a decadelong struggle with the kingdom's military-backed royalist elite. She faces up to seven years in jail if convicted. Her arrest comes as the ruling junta, who toppled a government led by Thaksin's sister in 2014, hardens its clampdown on political expression ahead of a referendum on a controversial charter it has penned. The small bowl is used to pour water during Buddhist ceremonies and was distributed at a temple fair in northern Chiang Mai, the Shinawatra's hometown. It was painted red  a colour with strong associations to the family's supporters, who are known as the "Red Shirts". Local media reported it was signed by Thaksin along with a slogan that read: "The situation may be hot, but brothers and sisters may gain coolness from the water inside this bucket". Police declined to comment on the details of the bowl, saying only that they believed it was handed out by a "certain political party". "She was charged with section 116  inciting chaos in the country," said Nateephat Akarapongthiti from Chiang Mai's Mae Ping police station. The junta has outlawed all political activities and protests since the coup, in a vow to bridge the kingdom's vast divides. But critics say the generals are more focused on rooting out the influence of the Shinawatras, who have dominated electoral politics for the past 10 years and are seen as a threat to the elite's status quo. Junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha told reporters Tuesday he found the charge was "suitable" because "it might be a national security threat". "It was [a show of] support for people who have violated laws and run away from criminal charge," he said, a reference to Thaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. Police said Theerawan, a Chiang Mai resident, was released from custody today and will now face trial in a military court. "She said she held up the bowl, but she didn't think that was wrong," Nateephat told AFP. Rights groups say the junta has increasingly leaned on the country's tough sedition law to silence critics.</text>

	<text>DUBAI: A woman was fined and ordered to be deported from the United Arab Emirates for breaching her husband's privacy by checking his cell phone to see if he was cheating on her, Gulf News reported on Wednesday. The unnamed Arab expatriate was fined 150,000 dirhams ($40,843) by the criminal court in the emirate of Ajman, the English-language newspaper said. Her lawyer told the paper she had accused her husband of having an affair. She admitted she had accessed his phone without his permission and transferred photos to her device, the lawyer added. The husband lodged a complaint with the court which convicted her on Thursday last week under a cybercrime law which penalises "the invasion of privacy of another person" using information technology, the paper said. It said the couple were in their 30s but gave no other information.</text>

	<text>KAWASAKI: Japanese revellers carried giant phalluses through the streets of Kawasaki on Sunday to worship the humble penis and fertility in one of the world's most unusual festivals. Size matters at the Shinto Kanamara Matsuri, where groups of locals parade three heavy phalluses around the city  the biggest as tall as a full-grown man. Giggling festival-goers, including young children and grandmothers dressed in kimonos, sucked on penis lollipops and posed with phallus-shaped sculptures as political correctness was ignored for the day. An anatomically correct radish-carving contest drew a large crowd of sniggering onlookers, while blushing parents perched babies on a giant see-saw of frighteningly accurate likeness to pray for fertility. Tens of thousands gather every spring for the festival, where they can buy keepsakes such as key chains, trinkets, pens, chocolates and even toy glasses with a plastic penis nose. For the local priest of the Kanayama Shrine, however, it is no laughing matter. "If young children are not used to seeing (male genitalia), they could get into a bit of a panic when the time comes," Hiroyuki Nakamura told AFP, explaining the festival's educational role. "People come to pray for good fortune and to ask the gods to protect them. The festival is steeped in the past but has still has a valuable part to play in modern society." Known as the Festival of the Steel Phallus  or colloquially as the "Willy Festival"  legend has it that in the Edo Period (1603-1868) a sharp-toothed demon inhabiting a woman's vagina castrated several unfortunate young men on their wedding nights. A local blacksmith came to the rescue by forging an iron dildo to break the demon's teeth and today a three-foot (one-metre) black steel phallus sits in the shrine's courtyard to honour the Shinto deities of fertility, childbirth and protection from sexually transmitted infections. Over the centuries, sex workers also made a pilgrimage to the shrine to seek its powers of protection before the festival became a tourist attraction in the 1970s. "I think it's brilliant," said Sayuri Kubo, a 14-year-old schoolgirl proudly holding an erotic lollipop. "The mikoshi (portable shrine) parade was awesome." Three mikoshi are lugged through the streets of Kawasaki, including a giant pink phallus called Elizabeth, donated by a local drag queen club. There is a serious side to the frivolity, despite the bizarre sight of normally reserved Japanese housewives posing for snapshots with oversized dildos. Proceeds from sales of the saucy memorabilia go to HIV research while the shrine itself is visited year-round by married couples hoping to start a family. "It's about propagating the species," nursery school teacher Natsuki Kanayama told AFP, holding lollipops in both hands with another poking out of her cleavage. "I'm praying that I can have as many children as possible." Not surprisingly, however, the festival drew curious stares from visiting foreigners. "It's insane," said American tourist Jason Bradley. "I've heard about 'Cool Japan'  I guess this is what they mean."</text>

	<text>CAIRO: World Footballer of the Year Lionel Messi found himself the unlikely figure of controversy in Egypt after a local politician and a soccer official reacted angrily when he donated a pair of his boots to raise money for charity. MBC Masr channel broadcast an interview last Saturday with Barcelona's Messi on the television programme "Yes I am Famous", but the announcement that the Argentina forward would auction his boots for charity provoked an unexpected response. Member of parliament and television presenter Said Hasasin, appearing on his own talk show, took off his shoes and said he would donate them to the poor of Argentina. "Whose shoes do you want to sell, Messi? How much do you think it will get? You don't know that the nail of a baby Egyptian is worth more than your shoes? Keep your shoes to yourself or sell them to Israel." "Messi, we Egyptians are 90 million people, who have pride, we have shoes." "We don't eat off the money of other peoples' shoes. I would have understood if he donated his Barcelona uniform to the Egyptians, it's accepted. But just the shoes? It's humiliating to all Egyptians and I do not accept this humiliation. Egyptians may not find food, but they have pride." "We Egyptians have never been humiliated before during our seven thousand years of civilization." Throwing shoes is considered an insult in the Middle East. Hasasin called up Azmy Megahed, a spokesman for the Egyptian Football Association, on his programme, who added: "I am confused. If he (Messi) intends to humiliate us, then I say he'd better put these shoes on his head and on the heads of the people supporting him. We don't need his shoes and we don't need charity from Jewish or Israeli people. Give your shoes to your country, Argentina is full of poverty." MBC Masr's Mona El-Sharkawy who interviewed Messi said the gesture had been misinterpreted and that the donation was not for an Egyptian charity. "This is so false. It's a trend on our show that we take a souvenir from our guest and put it on auction for charity," El-Sharkawy was quoted as saying by news agency Ahram. "I am surprised, I didn't say we will be giving it to charity in Egypt or any other place. I don't know why they said he is presenting it to Egypt. This was never said." Messi has not commented on the reaction to his donation. Former Egypt forward Mido said he was grateful for Messi's gesture, writing on Twitter: "The most precious thing the writer owns is his pen ... and the most precious thing the footballer owns is his shoes. I hope we stop the false accusations."</text>

	<text>JOHANNESBURG: With their economy flatlining, currency on the ropes and politics in turmoil, many South Africans are turning to humour for relief, mainly at the expense of President Jacob Zuma and his $16-million home improvements. Within minutes of Zuma surviving Tuesday's heated impeachment vote in parliament thanks to unanimous support from African National Congress (ANC) loyalists, the 73-year-old traditionalist Zulu was facing another roasting on the nation's irreverent stand-up circuit. "Jacob Zuma is the dude who just threw up all over the dance floor but still doesn't want to go home," comedian Lazola Gola quipped, to roars of laughter at an open mike event at Kitchener's Bar, a 100-year-old watering hole built in the heyday of Johannesburg's gold rush. For comedians, Zuma is the gift that keeps on giving, a politician whose career has run the full gamut of scandal, from a love-child and corruption charges to foot-in-mouth insults of African countries and his belief, expressed during a 2006 rape trial, that having a shower can prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS. However, no episode has surpassed the six-year imbroglio over the "security upgrades" to his sprawling Nkandla private residence that included an amphitheatre, swimming pool, cattle enclosure and chicken run. Even though South Africa's top court said last week he had broken the constitution by disobeying a watchdog's order to pay back some money, Zuma has ploughed on, blaming his lawyers for giving bum advice and apologising for creating "confusion". That represented a rare moment of contrition from a leader who has mocked his non-Zulu opponents' pronunciation of Nkandla  rolling his eyes in parliament and dragging out the main syllable, 'Nkaaaaaaaandla'  and has criticized "clever blacks" for getting upset about the issue. Demonstrating political analysis as sharp as his wit, comedian Mojak Lehoko said Zuma's ability to ride out the constitutional court smack-down was no surprise. "This is a man who has survived more than 700 corruption charges and a rape case. There's no way he's going to jail over some home improvements and a swimming pool," he said backstage. Mad reality While much of South Africa's humour inevitably plays on the racial divides that remain two decades after apartheid  particularly between blacks and whites  the ruling ANC party and its leaders, past and present, are also frequent targets. Nor are there any sacred cows. In one Lehoko skit mocking the broken manner in which Zuma reads out large numbers in English, he and Mandela are sitting round a fire smoking marijuana, when the anti-apartheid leader accuses Zuma of hogging the joint. "Come on, Comrade Jacob, you know the rules  two puffs and pass it on," Mandela says. "But I've only had one ...," Zuma protests. "Thousand, seven hundred and twenty eight." Zuma's reputation for gaffes  in January his office had to correct his assertion Africa was bigger than all the other continents put together  is even starting to make waves internationally. South African host of "Daily Show", Trevor Noah, explained to US audiences this week how Zuma was elected in 2009 without ever being formally cleared by a court of hundreds of corruption charges. "I know, I know, that should have been a red flag to South Africans but ever since apartheid we've strived to be colour blind, so all we saw was a flag," Noah said. Others have taken the view that the politics of the self-styled "Rainbow Nation" have become so bizarre that satire is unable to compete with the real thing. "April Fools' Day 2016 cancelled till further notice," Daily Maverick, a respected online political magazine, wrote on April 1. "We couldn't come up with anything half as mad as SA reality today. Sorry."</text>

	<text>PANAJI: Arvind Kejriwal's first rally in the state of Goa as Delhi chief minister will be closely watched by other political parties in the state on Sunday. Kejriwal will address a large gathering at Campal Grounds in the capital city on Sunday evening along with seven other speakers including Punjab MP Bhagwant Mann. AAP's national convenor will fly to Goa on Sunday afternoon and will be greeted by members of Goa's aboriginal Kunbi tribe from Nuvem. Members of the fishing community will also hand over a petition to him with a list of issues they're grappling with. In the past one week AAP's volunteers have personally handed invites to over two lakh households throughout the state and expect a strong response at the rally, the party's media coordinator in Goa, Rupesh Shinkre told TOI. Kejriwal has turned down the offer of staying at a fancy hotel, preferring to stay with one of the AAP volunteers in Panaji city for the night. On Monday morning, he will pay tribute to Goa's first chief minister Dayanand Bandodkar, the father of Goan nationalism, Tristao de Braganca Cunha and the father of Goa's Opinion Poll Dr Jack de Sequeira. He will then hold a closed-door volunteers' meeting before he catches a flight back to Delhi. Two days ago, the party that is gearing up for the 2017 assembly elections in the state, announced that it would contest all 40 seats and declared the names of 40 coordinators in the state who will act as a bridge between the party and the people. Senior AAP leader Ashutosh on Thursday said it is was historic for the party to have set up the first phase of its organization in the state within such a short span of time. "Even the biggest political parties have not accomplished the task of organizational development of such magnitude within such a short period of time. AAP has arrived with a dream to change Goa," he added. Pankaj Gupta, AAP national secretary, said the party wants to change governance and politics in the country. "Today we have an organizational set up with people who can respond to people in each constituency in Goa." Ashutosh said there is national appeal for the party which wants to offer an alternative to the conventional, traditional politics of money power, muscle power and communalism in the country.</text>

	<text>Guwahati: Excitement has reached fever pitch over the swearing-in ceremony of Sarbananda Sonowal , who will be the first BJP chief minister to take charge in the state ending 15 years of Congress veteran Tarun Gogoi's rule. The grand saffron show on May 24, to be graced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other luminaries of his cabinet, promises to be the biggest political extravaganza the state has seen till now. The venue, Khanapara Veterinary Playground, is expected to turn into a sea of humanity when Sonowal and his ministers take the oath of office and secrecy amid a thousand cheers. The administration is on its toes to ensure the high-profile event passes off peacefully. Deputy commissioner, Kamrup (Metro) district, M Angamuthu, said, "We are expecting a gathering of about one lakh people as the Prime Minister and other VIPs are coming. A multi-layer security has been arranged." The DC added that the administration will be installing toilets and other facilities around the venue for the convenience of the people. Sources in the police department said there will be CCTV cameras and parking arrangements and that they are firming up their plans. Youngsters like Jyotirmoy and Ananta plan to wear new kurtas on Tuesday. They said they would be there at the ground with their friends to witness the historic event. "From Tuesday, it will be a new journey for our state," gushed the two, and then said wisely, "We voted for change. But change does not mean change of government. The new government will have to usher in change." For some like Jibon Das, a teacher from Bongaigaon and an AGP supporter, it's like revisiting that moment in 1985 when the AGP came to power amid huge expectations. "This event sounds as promising as the Nehru stadium event of 1985. We expect the same grandeur at Sonowal's show," he said. The Federation of Industries &amp; Commerce of North Eastern Region (FINER) said it is looking forward to the formation of a chief minister's high powered Economic Advisory Council on the lines of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, to address key economic issues of the state. "We expect the new government will implement their Vision Document 2016-2025, in letter and spirit and put the economy on the fast track and meet the expectations of all," said R S Joshi, chairman, FINER.</text>

	<text>GUWAHATI: With the polls done and dusted, the next big question doing the rounds is how BJP will accommodate top Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) leaders like Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and Brindaban Goswami who are senior to CM-designate Sarbananda Sonowal. Though AGP, which won 14 of the 30 seats it contested, is silent on the issue of ministerial berths, party insiders said it will seek three cabinet posts. BJP had given 24 seats to AGP, but the regional party fielded candidates in six more constituencies. Most winners from AGP had served as state ministers in the eighties and nineties. Mahanta, who was twice the CM of Assam, has said he will follow his party's decision but sources said he would not be comfortable with an insignificant role. "As the big brother of the alliance, BJP will have a major role. I have no problem following what the party leadership decides," he has said. "Mahanta is a senior AGP leader. He does not want to leave politics. Now, it's up to the central leadership of BJP to utilize his experience," said an AGP insider. Earlier, there was speculation that Mahanta would be accommodated as governor or speaker. Former education minister and ex-AGP president Brindaban Goswami, who won from Tezpur, also faces a similar situation. It will be difficult for both Mahanta and Goswami to work under Sonowal who is much junior to them and who had worked under them when he was in AGP. Sonowal left AGP in 2011. "All the alliance parties will sit together and take a call on the issue. I want to serve the people after 15 years of Congress misrule," said AGP president Atul Bora, who won from Bokakhat. He said living up to the people's expectations is the party's priority. "This time, the expectations of the people are even higher than in 1985 when we first formed the government," Bora added.</text>

	<text>AHMEDABAD: Gujarat ATS sources on Saturday claimed that in the latest threat video from the dreaded terror outfit Islamic States in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Gujarat has been specifically named as their potential target. In a map shown in the threat video, Gujarat has been specifically marked, said an ATS official. It is noteworthy that in a threat video earlier in September 2013, after the elimination of Osama bin Laden , Al Qaeda's no 2 Ayman-Al-Zawahiri had named Gujarat and Ahmedabad as their target "The video also mentioned details about 2002 Gujarat riots and Babri demolition in December 1992," said an ATS source. According to ATS sources, it is more important that during the interrogation of recently arrested IM suspect Alamzeb Afridi, allegedly a key accused in the July 2008 serial blasts, it came to light that Afridi has actually translated speeches of IS chief Abu Bakar Al Baghdadi into Gujarati and put them on Jehadi websites. "This itself was an indication that IS wants to target Gujarati youths through such provocative material. Afridi was in touch with Shafi Armar, supposedly based somewhere in Waziristan in Pakistan, and it was Shafi who has asked Afridi to translate Jehadi speeches of Baghdahi into Gujarati. Afridi has also expressed his desire to sneak through India to Syria to fight for the terror outfit," said an ATS official. Sources in ATS said May 21 was the day when former PM of India Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated and the day is marked as the terror fighting day. "On such day IS has issued the threat and we are taking it seriously," added a senior ATS official.</text>

	<text>AHMEDABAD: A couple from Anand town in central Gujarat scaled Mt Everest at age 50. Chetna Rana and her husband Pradip Sahu are the first such couple and among the few in the country to have achieved this feat. The couple had touched the sunmit at 8,848 mt above sea level on May 19, but could not share their joy with the rest of the world due to a slight change in the weather. The couple recently made it to the camp site just below the summit to finally announce their achievement. This was the couple's third attempt to scale Mt Everest. In the first unsuccessful attempt in 2014 there were reports of a major landslide and the death of 13 Sherpa men, which prompted the couple to abandon the expedition. In their second attempt in 2015, earthquakes were reported from the area. This was the couple's third attempt. The couple have been literal explorers and even teach mountaineering to aspiring volunteers. The couple has been pursuing the hobby for the last 30 years, and has spent their entire life's savings towards this expedition, claim their close relatives.</text>

	<text>RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: After a 14-year-old boy was attacked and preyed upon by a lioness in Ambardi village in Dhari range of Amreli, the forest department has captured 10 of the 14 lions seen in the region. Friday's attack was the third incident in the vicinity of Ambardi village in the last two months. Forest officials fear that one or more members of the pride could have become man-eater. However, this could only be ascertained after proper analysis and behavioural study of the wild cats. Experts believe that the pride of lions seemed to be a disturbed group. But they , too, do not rule out the possibility of any of them becoming man-eater. Chief conservator of forest A P Singh said, "There is a likelihood that one of the pride members may have become a man-eater as a result of which others could also get affected. We cannot ignore it and hence we have to cage the entire group and study their behaviour. " He said that there have been instances of leopards and tigers turning man-eaters, but never in case of lions. "Lions are also member of the flesh eating family and hence the possibility cannot be ignored," Singh added. Jayraj Devipujak was killed by a lioness while he was sleeping with his father in a mango orchard in Ambardi village. His body was later found about 500 metres from where he was sleeping. Jay raj's father Mahdu Devipujak, who tried to scare the wild animal was also injured in the attack. On Saturday, three teams from Dhari, Jasadhar and Sasan-Gir range were rushed to Ambardi. Forest officials said that they has successfully caged 10 lions and are in process of capturing the rest. Member of the National Wildlife Board, H S Singh said the group might be disturbed as they have been displaced because of the Ambardi interpretation project. "I feel, capturing the group is good as it help to know if more than one animal has tasted human flesh or not." Wildlife expert, Divyabhanusinh Chavda states that there was a possibility that disturbed animals can turn man-eater or attack humans.</text>

	<text>Rajkot: A 14-year-old boy was killed by a lioness while he was sleeping alongside his father in a mango orchard in Ambardi village of Dhari taluka in Amreli. This is the third such lion attack near Ambardi village. Forest officials said the common thing in these attacks is that the wild cat had preyed on humans in all three cases. Concerned over the seriousness of the issue, the forest department has issued orders to cage the entire pride of 14 lions found near the village and analyse their behaviour. The deceased boy was identified as Jayraj Devipujak. His body was later found about 500 metres from where he was sleeping. Jayraj's father Mahdu Devipujak, who tried to scare the wild animal, was also injured in the attack. "We have placed cages near the village to nab the pride of lion. According to our estimation, there are 14 lions in the pride seen around Ambaradi village," said Mahipatsinh Jadeja, assistant conservator of forests, Gir-East division, Dhari. Caging the entire pride is an unprecedented move by the forest department, said another forest official, adding that the decision was triggered because in the earlier two cases also the lion had preyed on the humans. According to forest officials, Jayraj was attacked by the lioness when he was asleep alongside his father in the mango orchard of Ambardi village sarpanch Nathabhai. The incident occurred around 3.30 am. Father of the deceased boy is an agricultural labourer and has been working in the farms of Nathabhai since last two years. Earlier, on April 10, lions killed 50-year-old Labhuben Solanki in Bharad village in Dhari taluka of Amreli, while she was asleep in an open field. Before that, lions killed Jinabhai Makwana (60) in Ambardi village on March 19. He too was asleep when the lion attacked him.</text>

	<text>Palanpur: Nearly 300 acres of land was submerged in water following a 20-feet wide breach in a minor Narmada canal passing through Mavsari village in Vav taluka of Banaskantha on Friday. Officials of the irrigation department rushed to the spot and started plugging the breach. Executive engineer of Narmada Nigam at Tharad CD Patel said, "The only way out is to shut the gates of main canal." While farmers said the breach had been caused due to the release of excessive water in the canal, the irrigation department officials at Thahrad said it had occurred due to a hole in the side wall of the canal. The farmers said knee deep water has inundated fields where ready crop of summer millet was lying. Millet is the only crop sown in the summer in the region. Agro scientist of Sardarkrishinagar Agricultural University Dantiwada (SADU) AM Patel said this is the season of summer millet in the Banaskantha. After crop cutting the millet was lying in the fields, no one can put aside the loss. How much loss the farmers had to suffer depends on the quantity of the produce and the actual area of the crop, he added. Meanwhile water flowing from the canal fields continued unabated. Water supply was resumed on May 15 during chief minister Anandiben Patel's visit to Krishimela here. She had announced release of Narmada water in the minor canal for irrigation.</text>

This tip works for almost all websites. iPhone SE review: Apple is more clever than you thought Apple's latest innovation iPhone SE may not be worth queuing up for. Also, it is exactly not the first iPhone for price conscious consumers in India. In addition, almost all websites have a dedicated option (mostly at the bottom of the webpage) that can be used to load their full desktop variants with one click. The ability to access full desktop versions of websites on iPhone can come in really handy, especially for websites whose mobile versions are limited or don't render properly. Try it out, and let us know your thoughts in the comments below.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: It's the time of the year that Dota 2 players from all over the world wait for. As 'The International 2016 Battle Pass' is out and things look better than they ever did. The first thing to note is that the Compendium is a part of the Battle Pass and is not the primary commodity to buy this time around. And like previous years, the Battle Pass can level up. However, this time the Battle Pass has rewards available till 2,500 level, which is a lot more than anything seen previously. This year a level 1 Battle Pass would cost $9.99 while the level 50 would cost $26.99 which is a dollar less than last time around. Extra levels can be bought as well and would cost $2.49 for 5 levels, $4.99 for 11 levels and $9.99 for 24 levels. The initial bundle comes with Immortal Treasure I, II and III apiece, a seasonal terrain, a Vengeful Spirit taunt item, Aurora weather item, The International 2016 music pack, The International 2016 cursor pack, an Onibi evolving courier, a Smeevil Penance evolving ward, an emoticon pack,The International 2016 HUD skin, loading screens, an Effigy Block of The International 2016 and a Crystal Maiden announcer pack. Games startups play to survive in the gaming space Gaming companies find that high number of downloads are no reflection of success. In order to improve retention levels, companies are increasingly focusing on localisation of games. There is a new Quest system where players will be able to choose paths and difficulties which will offer rewards accordingly. And players who reach level 225 will earn a Legion Commander immortal item. The wagering system that we saw in the last two Battle Passes of the Majors is back again and works just the same. A new addition is the Community Challenge where communities will have to complete objectives collectively to gain rewards. Valve is offering a new challenge to the whole Dota 2 community and will grant every Battle Pass owner with three 'Trust of the Benefactor' treasures if the total prize pool exceeds last year's, which was $18,429,613. Each 'Trust of the Benefactor' treasure will offer a chance to receive a 2016 Immortal Treasure, a Random Hero Set, an Arcana Set, or an ultra rare chance at one of the following limited-run prizes: 200 x Fire Lotus Belt 200 x Golden Ornithomancer Mantle 200 x Dragonclaw Hook 200 x Rainmaker 200 x Pipe of Dezun 200 x Perceptions of the Eternal Mind 200 x Kantusa The Script Sword 200 x Shattered Greatsword 200 x Golden Gravelmaw 100 x Drodo the Druffin 100 x Golden Grasping Bludgeon 100 x Golden Shards of Exile 100 x Golden Staff of Perplex 100 x Golden Huntling 100 x Golden Severing Crest 100 x Golden Sullen Hollow 100 x Golden Lamb to the Slaughter 100 x Lockjaw the Boxhound 50 x Golden Doomling 50 x Murrissey the Smeevil 50 x Ice Baby Roshan 50 x Fire Baby Roshan 25 x Guard of the Red Mist 25 x Axe of Phractos 25 x Monarch Bow 25 x Burning Fiend 25 x ??? ASUS unveils four gaming motherboards Mumbai, May 11 (IANS) Taiwan-based computer hardware company ASUS and Republic of Gamers (ROG) on Wednesday launched four new motherboards that provide advanced customisation flexibility to achieve extreme performance. Players will be able to predict the total amount of the prize money as well and will be rewarded with 10 levels for it. Another new addition this year is the Find Your Peak Rank option which will let the players achieve the highest MMR (Match Making Rating) they can and swap it with their present MMR by completing 40 games. The other unique new item introduced is the river vials which will give the river custom effects. These will come with charges and will change the texture of the river for 10 mins at a time. The most rare one among these is the Blood Vial which can be obtained by reaching level 2500. Other features include the Weekend Battle Cup, Arcana Voting, Battle Log and Compendium. The Immortal Treasure I has Immortal items of Enchantress, Omniknight, Timbersaw, Juggernaut, Phantom Lancer, Weaver and Faceless Void.</text>

	<text>PANAJI: The most convenient way to do laundry and dry cleaning just got in town. An Android app PickMyCart which offers the opportunity to avail of laundry services at the touch of a button, was launched in Panaji on Friday. Designed by Goa-based start-up, Androcid Media, the app requires users to login with their credentials, following which the user's mobile number is verified. Once the desired service is selected, the user can add the required amount of clothing to the e-cart and send the command for laundry. Unlike most e-service, PickMyCart gives users the privilege to choose a delivery slot and pick up slot according to a date and time convenient to the user. Though in its first leg, the app is catering to laundry requirements, developers of the innovative app intend to further its services with the order and purchase of grocery, gas cylinders and fresh flowers.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Chinese smartphone manufacturer Coolpad has just launched its Coolpad Max smartphone in India. Priced at Rs 24,999, the smartphone will be competing with the likes of Xiaomi Mi 5 . We spent some time with the device and here are our first impressions. Design The design of the Coolpad Max seems heavily inspired from the iPhone 6S, with a metal body and curved glass screen with rounded edges. It also feels a little heavy in hand. The non-removable back panel of the Coolpad Max carries a 13MP rear camera with LED flash, fingerprint sensor and Coolpad branding. Volume keys are placed on the left whereas the power key is on the right. The 3.5mm audio jack, speaker unit and micro-USB port are placed at the bottom edge of the smartphone. The front is largely dominated by a 5.4-inch screen and there are no physical buttons. All in all, the design of the Coolpad Max seems pretty impressive. Coolpad takes on Xiaomi Mi 5; launches Max for Rs 25,000 As widely expected, Cooplad has launched its latest smartphone Max in India today. The smartphone will add to the companys mid-range portfolio and will be exclusively available on Display Coolpad Max features a 5.4-inch Full HD display with 1080x1920 pixels resolution. The display produces really sharp colours and has good visibility under the sun. Viewing angles are good as well. Hardware Coolpad Max is powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. During our brief time with the smartphone, it performed pretty well and we did not face any lag at all. However, we'll look into it more during our in-depth review. Software Coolpad Max runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with Coolpad's custom UI baked on top. The phone's UI has no app drawer and all app icons are displayed on the homescreen itself. The highlight of the smartphone is its 'Dual in One' system that creates two virtual spaces - Private and Main, inside the OS. Files, personal contacts and other information stored in the Private space are only accessible to the owner. It is also possible to create a separate phone book, WhatsApp account and more in the Private space. On the other hand, Main space lets both the owner and others to access apps and information just like any other smartphone. The phone comes preloaded with a number of apps including Facebook and WhatsApp. Some of the preloaded apps are specifically designed for Coolpad, such as Rock Wallpaper and Cool Services store. Camera The phone comes with a 13MP rear camera with LED flash and a 5MP front-facing snapper for selfies. Camera app is easy to use and the company has also incorporated different modes to enhance the photography experience. Judging by some of our quick test shots, the camera is capable of clicking good images with impressive amount of detailing. The selfie camera is appreciably good as well. Comparison: Coolpad Max vs Xiaomi Mi 5 Coolpad has just launched its latest smartphone Max in India. The handset flaunts a metal frame design and comes with a price tag of Rs 24,999. We compare the device with the recently- launched Xiaomi Mi 5 to see where it stands in terms of specifications. What we think The Coolpad Max is a good device in terms of specifications but is priced too high. However, for a more accurate opinion stay tuned for its complete review.</text>

	<text>Google Play Store has finally reached Chrome. At the recent Google I/O 2016 developer conference, the company announced the entry of Android apps in Chrome OS . Users are already able to run some of the Android apps on Chrome OS, but now Google is bringing all the 1.5 million Android apps to the Chromebooks. As Google wrote in a blog post, "This means you'll be able to download and use Android apps, so you can make a Skype call, work with Office files and be productive offline - or take a break with games like Minecraft, Hearthstone or Clash of Clans." Google I/O 2016: Now access Android Auto in non-compatible cars too To use the feature, all they would need to do is connect their smartphone with the vehicles infotainment system using either a 3.5mm auxilliary jack or Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The company further adds in the post that not only this gives a boost to the Chrome OS but will also make it easy for developers to bring their apps on the OS without any need to roll out an update. While Google has announced the Play Store support in Chrome OS, it is not rolling out to users right away. It will first come to the Chrome OS dev channel in June with the release of M53. The Google Play access in Chrome OS will first be hitting the Asus Chromebook Flip, the Acer Chromebook R 11 and the Chromebook Pixel (2015). Also, the Mountainview-based tech firm promises to bring Google Play to other Chromebook devices in future. Some of the partners that are already working to bring Android apps to their Chromebooks include Acer, Asus, Dell, Haier, Lava (Xolo Chromebook), HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba and more. Google I/O 2016: Home, Allo and other takeaways A new virtual-reality system from Google and a way to use Android apps without downloading Android apps are among the highlights at the company's annual developer showcase in Mountain View, California. As Venturebeat reports it, the Google Play icon will be visible at the bottom left corner near the search icon. Users will also be able to bring their settings and app credentials from Android to the Chrome OS. The Google Play Store will be available on Chrome OS as an update. When the update reaches Chromebook devices, users will get a notification. They will be able to install the update once they accept the store's terms and conditions. Multitasking also gets easier with Android apps on the Chrome OS. Users will be able to view the Android apps in three different window sizes, making it easy to work on different apps simultaneously. For those wondering, there won't be any changes coming to the existing Chrome Web Store.</text>

	<text>Lenovo seems all geared up to take the lead in the budget Indian smartphone market. After its own 'K' series and the highly successful Moto series from its now-owned Motorola stable, the company has now brought its ZUK sub-brand to India. Lenovo's online-only sub-brand, ZUK is set to compete against the likes of Xiaomi, LeEco, and OnePlus. The Z1 is the first smartphone in India to bear the ZUK branding, and comes with Lenovo's promise of quality. One look at ZUK Z1's specifications is enough to remind anyone of the much talked about OnePlus One. While the OnePlus One is dated now, the Z1 is looking to gain some marketshare with its competitive price tag of Rs 13,499. Read also: Lenovo ZUK Z1 first flash sale ZUK Z1 has entered India almost a year late, and the market is now packed with feature packed Android smartphones that cost under Rs 15,000. In fact, the newly launched Moto G4 Plus by Lenovo-owned Motorola is also similarly priced. So with numerous affordable smartphones already rubbing shoulders against each other, does the ZUK Z1 stand a chance in the Indian smartphone market? Read our detailed review to find out. Design and display The ZUK Z1 looks simplistic yet attractive. It boasts a metal frame paired with a plastic rear panel. Build quality is surprisingly good and the phone is lightweight as well. The fingerprint scanner perfectly blends with the front glass panel and thus, doesn't stick out. Despite having a 5.5-inch screen, the device is very handy. The curved back helps a lot with the grip as well. This smartphone comes with a massive 4,100mAh battery and Lenovo has done a good job in tackling the weight of the device. The front panel is nothing unique, and looks similar to any other budget smartphone. ZUK Z1 offers a 5.5-inch Full HD display of 1,080x1,920 pixels resolution, with pixel density coming at around 401ppi. Overall, the display quality is decent. The panel offers good colour reproduction and contrast ratio. The viewing angles are decent too. However, It is not easy to use the phone under direct sunlight due to the reflective display. Performance and camera The ZUK Z1 is powered by a quad-core 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor paired with 3GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory. While the processor is dated, it's still flagship-class and thus shouldn't be an issue for most users. The fact that it's included in a phone priced at Rs 13,499 only makes things better. Overall, the device proved to be really smooth during our testing. We didn't experience any hiccups while multi-tasking, even with intensive apps. Gaming performance was good too. Lenovo ZUK Z1 is among the cheapest smartphones that offer 64GB of in-built storage. However, there is no microSD card slot. The ZUK Z1 is not a phone to run benchmark tests on as it houses a pretty old processor, and the same will reflect in the scores. But for spec lovers who aren't willing to spend beyond Rs 15,000, this phone ticks all the right boxes. ZUK Z1 is a dual-sim smartphone with 4G support for both. It is backed by a 4,100mAh battery that easily lasted us a full day with moderate use. The phone also comes with a USB Type-C port. The best feature of the ZUK Z1 has to be its software. It offers a welcome change from typical custom UIs found on most Chinese smartphones. The phone runs Cyanogen OS 12.1 based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. With Cyanogen OS, users not only get to enjoy a different experience but also extensive customization. This is ideal for users who love to tweak the look and feel of their smartphones regularly. Cyanogen OS ran smoothly on the phone, without any bugs or errors. On the camera front, there is a 13MP rear camera with dual LED flash and optical image stabilization along with an 8MP selfie shooter. The camera is fast and captured some decent shots during our testing. However, low light images didn't turn out to be that good. The 8MP camera on the front delivered appreciably good selfies as well. Verdict At a price of Rs 13,499, the ZUK Z1 is a perfect budget smartphone. It's one of the very few smartphones about which you'll likely have very little to complain. Lenovo ZUK Z1 delivers on all fronts, and can be considered as a cheaper OnePlus One. However, the real challenge for prospective buyers will be deciding between the ZUK Z1 and the recently launched Moto G4 Plus.

	<text>HELSINKI: Nokia is cutting 1,032 jobs in Finland as part of a cost-cutting programme following its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent , the telecom network equipment maker said in a statement on Friday. Finland's biggest company has cut thousands of jobs in its home country over the past decade as its once-dominant phone business was eclipsed by the rise of smartphone rivals. Nokia set to make a comeback with Android phones and tablets Once the world's biggest maker of mobile phones, Nokia was wrongfooted by the rise of smartphones and sold its entire handset business to Microsoft in 2014 Nokia started the latest cost cutting programme in April and is targeting 900 million euros ($1 billion) of operating cost synergies from the Alcatel deal by 2018. Nokia's net sales miss forecast, ups cost cutting target Nokia's net sales of telecoms equipment fell more than expected in the first quarter and the Finnish company warned earnings in its mainstay business would decline this year due to weakening demand for mobile gear in key markets. The company has declined to give an overall figure for global job cuts, but has said it in talks with employee representatives in about 30 countries. Nokia employs about 104,000 people worldwide, with about 6,850 in Finland, 4,800 in Germany and 4,200 in France.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: At its last year's I/O developer conference, Google announced a partnership with Levi Strauss &amp; Co., a clothing brand renowned for its Levis range of denim jeans. The partnership saw the introduction of 'Project Jacquard,' aimed at manufacturing smart clothing by weaving multi-touch sensors into fabrics. Almost a year later, the collaboration has come out with its first product. Demoed at Google I/O 2016, the 'Levi's Commuter x Jacquard by Google Trucker Jacket' is a smart piece of clothing. The jacket's garment has a conductive fabric woven into it in the form of an interactive patch. This patch is capable of sensing touch, pressure and even the position of the wearer's hand before it's touched. Google I/O 2016: 'Family Library' for Google Play Store introduced Amid the ongoing Google I/O 2016 conference, Google has started sending developers an email notifying them of an upcoming feature called 'Family Library,' as reported by Android Police. The interactive patch is woven into the jacket's left arm and connects to a loop in the cuff of the jacket via Bluetooth . This makes it possible to use the cuff to control your smartphone in a variety of ways. The technology also supports multiple gestures like tapping or swiping on the sleeve, and these can be used to do everything from changing tracks and volume to getting navigation directions via Google Maps . What's impressive about the smart jacket is that it's made using Levi's standard manufacturing process, and can thus be washed like any other piece of clothing. You just need to remove the Bluetooth enabled loop from the cuff before washing the jacket. Smartphones could soon replace your passport A UK-based company is working on a new technology that may spell the end for paper passports by allowing you to use your smartphone at immigration control. Through the Jacquard platform, developers will have access to a host of APIs which can be used to make the jacket work with third-party apps as well. The interactive jacket is meant to simplify navigation for commuters (especially bikers), without requiring them to take out their phones when on the move. Future plans include manufacturing a variety of other smart garments, including athletic and business wear. Levi Strauss and Co. will be shipping the first smart jacket(s) next year. Check out the video below to know more about the smart jacket &gt;</text>

	<text>Zack King, whose clips on Vine , Twitter's video platform, made him a superstar with millions of followers, is leaving the platform that made him famous. King is now thinking of moving to more mainstream social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat . Robby Ayala, another Vine superstar, plans to do the same. Why? To make more money, and to access the larger audience the other social networks provide. Twitter's live video app hires chief editor New York, May 3, 2016 (AFP) -Twitter's live video-streaming application, Periscope, has hired an editor in chief, Evan Hansen, who says he plans to showcase the best content and help develop the platform. Vine , once a top 50 app in the iTunes store, has now dropped to 200. Nearly 5,000 of Vine's stars with more than 15,000 followers have left the platform, as determined by Markerly, a company dealing with social media influencers. The average number of views on the top 10 Vine accounts have also decreased by 29% this year, reports The Wall Street Journal. Will Stickney, Twitter spokesperson and a contributor to Vine, told the Journal that Twitter 's top priority this year is to give the Vine creators better tools, preventing them from migrating. Twitter to stop counting photos, links in 140-character limit New Delhi, May 17 (IANS) The micro-blogging site Twitter is reportedly planning to stop counting photos and links against the 140-character limit. "Vine... continues to be a place where creative trends start and explode across the web," he said Vine CEO Joe Gagliese, on the other hand, has actually encouraged clients to start using Facebook because he thinks that Vine does not have a strong advertising model in place yet. Gagliese believes that Facebook analytics are more robust, and its strong video features make for better monetization opportunities.</text>

	<text>iBall, after marking its presence in the smartphone and tablet segment, finally entered the laptop market by launching two new computing devices under its CompBook series. Earlier this week, the company launched the CompBook Excelance and the CompBook Exemplaire laptops priced at Rs 9,999 and Rs 13,999 respectively. We are yet to test how the laptop performs in real-world usage.The two laptops largely have the same set of specifications, except for the screen sizes - 11-inch and 14-inch. The smaller CompBook Excelance was the highlight of the launch event and now holds the title of the cheapest Windows 10 laptop available in India. We are yet to test the laptops in detail. However, during the limited time spent with them, we found the laptops to be just about right for the price point. As the cheapest Windows 10 laptop in India, the CompBook Excelance seems too good to be true. It has an 11-inch IPS antiglare display with a tactile chiclet keyboard. The display has great viewing angles too. Although the laptop's made out of plastic, it still feels sturdy. It is also light weight and highly portable. 5 key features of the cheapest Windows 10 laptop in India The new iBall CompBook Excelance is priced at Rs 9,999 and is also the cheapest Windows 10 laptop avaialble in India. The computing device includes a massive battery, latest Microsoft Windows OS, dual speakers and more. On the software side, you get Microsoft Windows 10 and all the features the OS comes with. These include Microsoft Edge browser, Cortana integration, universal apps and more. Under-the-hood, iBall CompBook Excelance packs a quad-core Intel Atom Z3735F processor clocked at 1.83GHz. It also comes with 2GB of RAM and Intel HD graphics. We tried some apps on the display unit and it handled them with ease. However, it is too early to jump to any conclusions as we are yet to review it. On the storage front, both laptops come with 32GB of in-built space of which a good amount is taken by Windows 10. iBall could've done better in this department as 32GB will likely not be enough for users. However, they have the option to add a microSD card up to 64GB for expansion. iBall CompBook laptops come with a VGA resolution webcam for video chats, and they have a microSD slot, a Mini HDMI port and 2 USB 2.0 ports. Another highlight of India's cheapest Windows 10 laptop is its large 10,000mAh battery, which is claimed by the company to last up to 8.5 hours on a single charge. We are yet to see how the battery performs in our tests, so stay tuned for the full review soon. If you are still confused as to which budget laptop to buy, here is our list of the cheapest laptops currently available in India.</text>

	<text>Flicking on a gas burner or cobbling together a fire might be the most common way of cooking in the great outdoors, but another option is on the way. The Wayv Adventurer is a battery-operated radio frequency cooking appliance that's small enough to fit in a backpack. In other words, it's a hand-held microwave. Wayv produced the Adventurer in partnership with NXP Semiconductors, having raised 150,000 of funds for its development via a 2014 Crowdcube crowdfunding campaign. It is designed to heat food and drink anywhere, while being compact, rugged and lightweight. It can be also be used in areas where having a lit flame is banned. Budget 2016: Microwaves segment await a fillip The Adventurer was conceived for use by the likes of military personnel and adventurers, but it can be used when you're simply out hiking or fishing, or even in workplaces or cabins where there are no cooking facilities. Between 100 ml (3.4 fl oz) and 500 ml (16.9 fl oz) of food or drink can be heated in the unit. Power is provided by interchangeable quick-charging li-ion batteries. These can be charged from in-car sockets or solar chargers as well as via mains power, and a full charge will provide around 30 minutes cooking (up to six cycles of heating for food or drink). Measuring 305 x 128 mm (12 x 5 in), the Adventurer is about the size of a typical flask and it weighs in at just 1.2 kg (2.6 lb). This means it will fit easily in a backpack and can be lugged around without any great effort. Apple users fooled into burning iPhones in microwaves 4chan trolls spread a hoax that said iOS 8 includes a feature that allows an iPhones battery to be charged when put in a household microwave. Simple controls on the top of the unit include start, stop, backlight and time adjustment buttons, as well as a digital display. Unlike the vacuum tubes used in conventional microwave ovens, the Adventurer uses technology developed for RF amplifiers in cellphone towers - laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductors (LDMOS) transistors - to generate its 250 W of power. This is what makes the design so compact and lightweight, and it also enables food to be heated evenly without the need for a turntable. The Wayv Adventurer was demonstrated last week by NXP at its own tech forum event. We're waiting for confirmation on a release date, but the Adventurer should land sometime next year at a cost of US$199. Credit: Gizmag.com</text>

	<text>Having arrived in India a few months back, Swedish audio equipment manufacturer Jays recently launched its premium on-ear headphones. Dubbed u-Jays, the headphones are priced at Rs 15,999. This has has put Jays in direct competition with brands that have already established themselves as high-end headphones brands in India, such as Sennheiser and Bose. We spent a few days with u-Jays, and here is what we think of them Build and design Simple and sophisticated are the two words that aptly describe the u-Jays. The headphones sport an all-metal design with an adjustable headband made of rubber-like material. In addition, u-Jays come with detachable foam ear-cushions and a connecting cable which make the headphones easier to be carried around. The cable also houses an in-line microphone and a three-button remote, which worked perfectly well at all times during our testing. READ ALSO: Apple patents hybrid wired/wireless headphones Despite sporting a sturdy build, the headphones are as comfortable as they can be. The earcups cover the ears completely without exerting too much pressure on them, even after extended hours of usage. The headband doesn't cause any discomfort either. However, after long hours of using the headphones, your ears might begin to hurt a bit. But that's the case with most of the headphones and thus, not much of an issue. Also, the material of the headband is prone to getting covered with dirt very easily. So you may have to clean it frequently if you want to keep the good looks of your u-Jays intact. To sum it up, we really liked the look and design of u-Jays headphones and found them to be premium and classy-looking. Despite being a little heavy, u-Jays headphones are pretty comfortable. Performance The u-Jays aren't just about good looks; they impress on the performance front as well. During our testing, the headphones offered a good and balanced audio output. Noise cancellation on the u-Jays was really good. You can easily use them at a noisy workplace or take them with you on a flight, u-Jays certainly won't disappoint. Another good aspect of the headphones is that they retain audio output clarity even at higher volume levels. Bass and treble levels were really good as well. That said, performance in terms of highs, mids and lows was mixed.

	<Heading>Airbus channels HR Giger for world's first 3D-printed motorcycle</Heading>

	<text>Airbus is typically associated with making airplanes, but a subsidiary called APWorks just announced the creation of the world's first 3D-printed motorcycle that can actually be used as a daily rider. Aptly named the Light Rider, given that it weighs in at a mere 35 kg (77 lb), the electric-powered two-wheeler appears to be what would happen if HR Geiger designed a motorcycle. The company said the exoskeleton-like design of the Light Rider came from the need to make the frame structurally able to withstand the loads and stresses of everyday riding. Powered by a 6-kW (8-hp) electric motor with a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), it may not be at home on the freeway, but can be used for daily city driving and commuting. Motorcycle startup shuts down, courtesy Apple's auto ambitions Apple Inc's aggressive recruitment of auto experts as it explores building a car has left a promising, if financially troubled, electric motorcycle startup in the dust. The frame of the Light Rider weighs all of 6 kg (13 lb) and is made of a material created and patented by APWorks called Scalmalloy. This is a second-generation aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy (AlMgS) that the company claims is stronger than the aluminum-silicon powder material used in most production-scale 3D printing today. The use of Scalmalloy allowed APWorks to create hollow rather than solid frame parts, which made it easier to hide most of the cables and other elements that might be more visible on a standard motorcycle. Bionic algorithms were also used to optimize the entire structure, resulting in a cleaner overall design and a finished bike that weighs 30 percent lighter than other eBikes currently in production. Tork Motorcycles raises funds from angel investors The startup is in the final stage of prototyping and certification procedures of the country's first electric motorcycle. In 2015, TE Connectivity created what was then billed as the first 3D-printed motorcycle , but it was a prototype only, weighed in at around 200 kg (440 lb) and was powered by a 750-W (1-hp) electric motor. While the Light Rider might be low on weight, the cost to buy one could be considered pretty heavy for the average motorcycle owner. Only 50 will be made, and APWorks is taking pre-orders for a 2,000 (US$2,450) deposit against a 50,000 (US$56,000) final cost. Delivery is expected to take about a year. APWorks said it would consider creating different styles of motorcycles, like an enduro or motocross bike, before it would venture into mass producing the Light Rider. So anyone lucky enough to afford one of the 50 currently being constructed may be the owner of one very limited edition motorcycle. Credit: Gizmag.com</text>

	<text>LONDON: HSBC, Europe's largest bank, were to begin laying off 850 information technology workers in Britain on Monday, the first big tranche of redundancies under a restructuring plan that will eliminate 8,000 British jobs by the end of next year. Most of the staff affected were being informed about the cuts on Monday, according to sources who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. HSBC apologises for online banking outage HSBC said that customers affected by a blackout on its personal banking online services will not "lose out", as technical problems suffered by Europe's biggest bank run into a second day. The employees are based in London, Sheffield, Leeds and Birmingham and all the jobs will disappear by the end of this year, the sources said. HSBC declined to comment. The bank unveiled its three-year restructuring plan last year, designed to pare back its sprawling global network by shutting underperforming businesses to improve earnings hurt by high compliance costs, fines and low interest rates. The restructuring will eventually eliminate one job in five around the world and around a sixth of jobs in Britain. HSBC bank back online after cyberattack Customers were able to log-on again from 2100 GMT on Friday, after the outage which started that morning. When the restructuring plan was announced, chief executive officer Stuart Gulliver said most of the job losses in Britain would come from employees leaving on their own accord. HSBC has 47,000 UK workers at the end of December, according to its most recent annual report. More cuts are expected over the coming months as the bank continues to consolidate IT and back office operations, the sources said.</text>

	<text>A weird phenomenon is taking place on Facebook. A user account 'Madhu Shah' is adding people after people, so much so that one is bound to find friends common with her. But the freakier bit is the fact that this Madhu Shah doesn't exist. How do we know? Thanks to a kind man who alerted the general public of the "scam" that it is. If you search her name, a series of results will pop up with the same name, same profile picture, and a number of mutual friends. Former employee accuses Facebook of intimidation, favouritism and sexism Not only did she write about the plight she and others went through, the former trending news curator at Facebook also confirmed that she and others were specifically trained to avoid using Twitter. There are nearly 27 'Madhu Shah' accounts on Facebook. People have been in a fix to find the user in their lists, clearly clueless as to how she appeared there in the first place. No one knows what's going on. It sure seems like a scam - whether phishing or other, one really can't say. If it's a phishing attempt, users must take caution and delete the account at the earliest to prevent risking their personal information. On second thoughts, block the user as well.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: A major American media company which owns prestigious dailies like Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune will outsource a part of its IT component to Indian software giant TCS , according to a media report. Chicago-based Tribune Publishing Company said it has informed its IT employees last month that it is moving work to India-based IT company Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ), a news report in Computer World said yesterday. However, it did not say the number of employees would be hit by such a move. "IT employees at Tribune Publishing say they received warning of the outsourcing late last year. In April, they were told that over an 18-month period, Tribune would be moving to information technology outsourcing across its business, according to employees contacted," the report said. The layoffs are expected to happen in the summer or fall season, it said, adding that TCS will offer jobs to some of its employees. A Tribune Publishing spokesman told Computer World that the company has made the strategic decision to outsource key functions of its legacy information technology department to create a more agile operating environment and to drive its overall business transformation. Here is how TCS bridged the Gulf with an all-women BPO Its not a run-of-the mill BPO unit. For one, the centre is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  a city not exactly known for its IT services industry. "This decision will allow us to better serve our customers, improve our systems and capabilities and create more opportunity for innovation. We thank all of our dedicated employees for their commitment to a seamless transition," the spokesperson was quoted as saying. Yesterday, Tribune Publishing confirmed that it has received an offer of all cash buy out acquisition from Gannett, a major American publication that owns among others the iconic The USA Today. Tribune Publishing owns several top US daily newspapers including The Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun. The India outsourcing of jobs by Tribune Publishing comes on the heels of a similar move by McClatchy which among others owns newspapers like The Miami Herald and The Sacramento Bee to another Indian IT company Wipro. Notably, some of these newspapers have been vocal critic of outsourcing of jobs to India. The move would affect between 120-150 IT employees, according to the report. Such a move might also have an impact on coverage of H-1B visas issues by these media outlets, it added.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Leading Indian tech-giant Tata Consultancy Services , today announced that its UK client, the National Employment Savings Trust , has signed up more than 100,000 employers to its auto-enrollment pension scheme. Established in 2010 as part of the government's workplace pension reforms, NEST requires all UK employers to enroll their eligible workforce into a qualifying workplace pension scheme. The roll-out of the auto enrollment began in October 2012 and since then more than three million members have been enrolled with NEST, which depends on its IT solutions partner and scheme administrator TCS for delivering outcome-based, end-to-end administration services across all aspects of the scheme. TCS in Time's Top 50 employers for women list in UK India's largest IT services firm TCS has been recognised as one of the UK's leading employers for women in a list published by The Times. Helen Dean , CEO, NEST said: "From a standing start in October 2012, NEST now has 100,000 employers signed up to the scheme and more than three million members. "It is vital that our IT infrastructure and digital services are able to flex and scale to meet demand as auto enrollment continues to roll-out." Praising the partnership with TCS, India's largest IT services provider, Helen said: "Our partnership with TCS has been invaluable, allowing us to innovate, handle high growth and helping us bring pension saving to millions of UK workers." TCS to appeal $940 million US court damages India's biggest IT outsourcing firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) says it will challenge $940 million in damages imposed by a US court in an intellectual property theft case. Shankar Narayanan, Country Head, UK &amp; Ireland, TCS said: "As a pension scheme conceived and built in the digital era, NEST is a fantastic example of what is possible when you put digital technology and advanced IT infrastructures at the heart of your organisation. The IT platforms that underpins NEST's operations including front and back-office, IT infrastructure hosting and overarching management and governance of the scheme administration, were all set up by TCS. The rapid growth in employer numbers is testament to a strong working partnership between TCS and NEST, the company said in a statement. Employing more than 11,000 people in the UK, TCS is one of the country's leading digital employers.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Just like its parent company Facebook , Instagram also has a separate section for storing messages from people who don't follow you on. To access this section, first you need to tap on the inbox icon on the top right corner. Once there, you'll see a 'Message Requests' text label. Finally, tap on this label and you'll be able to view incoming messages from people who don't follow you yet. The message listing also lets you accept or decline chat requests. Facebook rewards $10,000 to 10-year-old for finding a bug in Instagram, who uses it to buy computers for brothers The social networking giant has paid $10,000 to a 10-year-old boy for spotting a bug in Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform Instagram. The person sending the message will know that you have read his/her message only if you tap 'Allow'. It's worth noting that these 'other' messages are harder to ignore than those of Facebook, as they are right on top when you open your Direct Messages. Instagram recently went through a major visual revamp and introduced a new app icon as well. The new icon, with a simple camera figure and rainbow colours, is inspired by the previous icon. Along with this, Instagram also updated the icons for its other creative apps such as Layout, Boomerang and Hyperlapse. The update also refreshed Instagram's mobile apps with brightly coloured icons and a black and white user interface.</text>

	<text>PARIS: The last known survivor of the team that carried out last November's Paris attacks has refused to talk during questioning Friday by anti-terror judges, and the session has ended abruptly. Salah Abdeslam's lawyer, Frank Berton said his client invoked his right to silence. Abdeslam, 26, had said last month he wanted to explain all. Berton told reporters that Abdeslam was disturbed by the 24-hour video surveillance in his maximum-security cell. Friday was the first time Abdeslam was questioned since since his extradition from Belgium last month.</text>

	<text>FORT-DE-FRANCE: The French Caribbean island of Martinique has suffered its first Zika virus-related death, the regional health agency said on Saturday. "The patient, aged 84, had been hospitalised for 10 days in intensive care with Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS)," the agency said, adding that the Zika link came to light late last week. Some experts believe there is a link between Zika and GBS  in which the immune system attacks the nervous system. Doctors tests found that "the death is directly linked to Zika with Guillain-Barre Syndrome associated with Zika as the initial cause," regional health authority ARS said. "This death is the only one registered in Martinique since the start of the epidemic," the agency added. Before the death, the French Caribbean overseas department had listed 19 patients as confirmed suffering from GBS, which has been linked with Zika, as has paralysis-causing myelitis. Several cases of the virus have emerged from assumed GBS cases in Martinique's French Caribbean neighbour Guadeloupe as well as French Guyana. Zika has been linked to birth defects and deaths in newborns amid surging cases of neurological disorders and birth defects, notably in Brazil. According to a World Health Organisation report earlier this year, more than 40 countries or territories have reported transmission of Zika within their borders since last year, and eight have reported an increase in Guillain-Barre cases. Experts agree that Zika is behind a surge in cases of the birth defect microcephaly  babies born with abnormally small heads and brains  after their mothers were infected with the virus. But it is not clear just to what extent the disease, for which there is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, is linked with GBS. The ARS said that 1,770 people had contacted doctors between May 9 and 15 to ascertain if they might have the virus. The first Zika-related death was in Brazil last November and two other deaths have followed. Last week, Puerto Rican health authorities announced the first case of Zika-related microcephaly in a foetus, as the US territory grapples with the spread of the mosquito-borne virus.</text>

	<Heading>Germany eyes free wi-fi in public spaces, finally</Heading>

	<text>BERLIN: Try looking for a free wi-fi connection in the cafe down the street in Germany and, more likely than not, there isn't one. Forget about looking for open connections in parks or at key monuments. They just don't exist. In an age when almost everyone carries a smartphone, the absence of such free hotspots can appear to be an aberration in a country that is known for its technological prowess. But a new government deal may change all that, as it aims to tackle the root of the problem by exonerating the connection's provider of fraudulent usage by others. The snag has been Germany's tough rules to crack down on online piracy, with high fines for illegally downloading music and films. No one wants to run the risk of exposing their wi-fi connection to possible misuse, a fear that has turned Germany into a hotspot desert. A 2014 study by Eco, a federation of Internet professionals, found that there are only two open hotspots for every 100,000 residents in Germany, compared to 10 in Sweden and 29 in Britain. For many, that is a stumbling block in the development of the Internet, an obstacle Chancellor Angela Merkel's government wants to mow down. But seeking an agreement took months of tough negotiations. "A late but important step," said Justice Minister Heiko Maas on Twitter. According to the agreement reached this week within Merkel's left-right 'grand coalition' government, the law will be amended so that "wi-fi providers would be considered like access providers," that is to say, they are waived from all responsibility of users, and "will not be subject to any required checks". That is valid for anyone who offers their wi-fi access to others for free, be it a restaurant owner who allows clients to connect online or the friendly guy who gives his neighbour the password to get on his Internet access. Only 39 percent of Internet users in Germany go online using wi-fi outside of their homes, according to a survey in 2015 by Bitkom, the German high-technology federation. Plans by the government to amend the rule "will facilitate things for both operators and users," said Bernhard Rohleder, who heads Bitkom. For the federation Eco, it spells the end of the "great wall" to the development of hotspots in Germany, while hotels describe the move as an act of liberation. But not all are happy. The music industry federation fears that it could hurt creators and artists, and warned that it has "opened the doors and windows to illegal usage". A draft law prepared in September by Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel had required users to confirm that they are not doing anything illegal online, as well as for access providers to secure the network with passwords. But that was deemed too restrictive, leading to the current agreement which scraps these conditions. The proposal is due to be examined by cabinet before it is put to parliament, it is therefore not expected to come in force before the autumn.</text>

	<text>VIENNA: A gunman fired shots early today into a small crowd attending an open air concert organized by a local motorcycle club, killing two people and wounding 11 others before shooting himself to death, police said. Police said the overnight shooting in Austria's westernmost Voralberg province was preceded by a loud argument between the gunman and a woman in a nearby parking lot. The man then fetched a gun out of his car, left the parking lot and went to a field that was used as a concert venue, where he started shooting into the crowd of about 150 people, apparently at random. They said he killed himself after returning to the parking lot. The woman was not wounded in the shooting near Nenzing, a town about 40 kilometres east of Austria's border to Liechtenstein. State broadcaster ORF said the man apparently used a rifle or similar long weapon. Local media quoted rescue workers as saying some of the surviving victims were in serious condition. Police spokeswoman Susanne Dilp said she could not confirm that but described their wounds as "very diverse." She refused to name the motorcycle club but described it as "regional" rather than international. Dilp said no other details were available as police continued their investigation at the scene.</text>

	<text>SENDAI: Finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers united over the weekend in wishing that Britain stays in the European Union, but acknowledged they could do little more than hope. "The G7 did not talk about a Plan B to respond to what would happen if Britain left the European Union," French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told Reuters on Saturday. "We talked about ways to help Britain stay in the EU." Britain's momentous referendum on whether to stay in the EU has been a prime issue for global markets and policymakers, who can largely only wait and see what Britons will say at the polls on June 23. The ups and downs of polling data have swayed financial markets for months. Concern over the looming vote is a major risk for the Federal Reserve, which has indicated it may raise U.S. interest rates at its mid-June meeting but expressed concern about a "Brexit." Sapin did not elaborate on any steps the G7 discussed to keep Britain in the EU, during an interview on the sidelines of their meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Sendai, northeast Japan. "A Brexit would have heavy consequences," Sapin said. "It would be bad for Britain and bad for Europe, because investors would have doubts and this would affect capital flows." But G7 ministers were able to do little but rally around Prime Minister David Cameron's call for the EU's second-largest economy to remain in the union. "We clearly are concerned, collectively, at the risk of Brexit and do believe that could potentially have some economic impacts," Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau told Reuters in Sendai. But he added, "We haven't spoken of specific measures that might be taken in that regard." German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the G7 members "agreed that (a Brexit) would be the wrong decision." Cameron's aggressive campaign to woo a eurosceptic public to vote "In" appears to be working for now. The pound EURGBP=D4 this week touched its highest level against the euro in three and a half months as polls showed EU support strong and rising. An Ipsos-MORI poll on Friday found 55 percent favoured remaining in the EU versus 37 percent wanting "Out." Economic arguments appear to be having some pull on the British public as "In" proponents argue a Brexit would cause financial market turmoil and hurt the $2.9 trillion UK economy. A vote to leave would hammer British house prices by 10-18 percent, sending mortgage rates higher and hurting Britons trying to get onto the property ladder, finance minister George Osborne told the BBC on Friday. [L5N18H3LJ] Still, the topic can be delicate for politicians from other countries, as their comments could be counterproductive if they are seen in Britain as meddling. The G7's Japanese host, Finance Minister Taro Aso, said on Friday that some of his counterparts supported a British exit - a remark quickly retracted by his staff. [L3N18H3G0] "What the minister meant was that it would be good if Britain remained in the EU," a Finance Ministry official said. President Barack Obama stirred debate in April when he warned on a visit that Britain would be "in the back of the queue" for a trade deal with the United States if it dropped out of the EU. Obama's Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, summarizing the Sendai G7 meeting, did not mention a Brexit. The European Commission has largely stayed out of the campaign. "We have no Plan B for Brexit," European Union Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters in Sendai on Friday. "Our only plan is for Britain to remain in a united Europe."</text>

	<text>ISTANBUL: Turkey's governing party on Thursday formally tapped Binali Yildirim as its candidate to lead the party and become the country's next premier. The spokesman of the ruling Justice and Development Party , Omer Celik, made the announcement, saying the lawmaker from Izmir was chosen "with great consensus". Yildirim is Turkey's minister of transport, maritime and communication as well as a founding member of the AKP. He will run unopposed for the party leadership at a special convention on Sunday in Ankara. Traditionally, the post of premier in Turkey goes to the leader of the largest party in parliament. The shake-up comes after Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced May 4 he was stepping down due to differences with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan . Analysts expect his successor to be more in tune with Erdogan, who is pushing for a constitutional overhaul that would concentrate greater powers in his hands. Supporters credit Yildirim for his role in developing the president's signature infrastructure projects, which have helped buoy Turkey's economy and boost the party's popularity. The change in party leadership comes at a time when Turkey, a member of the Nato alliance, is facing multiple security threats including renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast, a wave of suicide bombings linked to Kurdish and Islamic State militants, as well as growing blowback from the war in neighboring Syria. "I will take this terror trouble off Turkey's agenda," vowed Yildirim addressing his party. He also thanked Davutoglu for his services. The transition also coincides with growing tensions with the European Union over a controversial deal to reduce the flow of illegal migrants from Turkey to Greece, which Davutoglu helped broker.</text>

	<text>GENEVA: A rare pear-shaped vivid pink diamond fetched 30.8 million Swiss francs ($31.46 million) at auction on Tuesday, Sotheby's said, but several other large stones failed to reach the reserve prices set by the sellers. The "Unique Pink", weighing 15.38 carats and mounted on a ring, sold to an Asian private collector bidding by telephone, the auction house said. It was the star lot at the saleroom's semi-annual auction in Geneva, with a pre-sale estimate of $28 million-$38 million. "The Unique Pink set a new world record for a fancy vivid pink diamond ... It's the highest price ever paid for a fancy vivid pink diamond," David Bennett, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's international jewellery division, told reporters. The "Sweet Josephine", a fancy vivid pink diamond weighing 16.08 carats, held the previous record since selling for $28.5 million at rival Christie's in November, and still retains the price per carat record in the category. Overall, the Sotheby's sale netted $175.2 million, "setting a new world record for any jewellery auction", Sotheby's said in a statement. It eclipsed $160 million set a year ago. In all, 83.2 percent of the 488 lots on offer found new owners, but "The Emperor Ruby" was among those stranded, with a bid of 3.6 million francs. "There were a few stones that were disappointing but overall the sale was a huge success," Bennett said. A British collection of 29 jewels by French jeweller Cartier sold for $3.4 million, doubling its low estimate, he said. A "new world record" was set for a jewel by the late Paris-based jeweller Alexandre Reza - a fancy intense blue diamond brooch surrounded with diamonds sold for $13.4 million, he said. "We've made a great effort to put together a sale that we thought was suitable for this particular market which is strong for the right things," Bennett said. "It seems to have paid off." Ehud Arye Laniado, chairman of New York-based Cora International LLC, which cut, polished and sold the pink diamond, told Reuters in the showroom: "It was the time to sell. It is quite a strong price. "We think slowly the market is grouping together with people who do believe in strong prices for fancy coloured diamonds. It is a good sign because we see people who do believe in the resale value of those stones, like art," he added. "The trend will move to white diamonds."</text>

	<text>BERLIN: With a spoon and spatula in hand, Zaid, a 23-year-old Iraqi refugee, lifts the lid on a large pot filled with goulash and potatoes as he begins his shift. From 6:30 to 8 pm, he is employed by the city of Berlin to dish out dinner to 152 other Syrian, Iraqi, Afghan and Moldovan refugees in a sports hall, which had been turned into an emergency shelter for the newcomers. Zaid is one of thousands of refugees who have taken on tasks ranging from repairing bicycles to pruning plants to cleaning sidewalks for pay of just over one euro ($1.1) an hour. The so-called "one-euro jobs" have been touted as a springboard for the newcomers into Germany's job market, but experts remain sceptical about their effectiveness. At the sports gym, Zaid tries to explain to the sceptical faces crowded in front of him what went into the beef stew that he described as "so German". For the work that includes setting the table, cutting bread, serving food and then cleaning up, he is paid 1.05 euros an hour. Restricted to working no more than 20 hours a week, Zaid gets a monthly income of 84 euros at best, a small extra on top of the 143 euros he receives as pocket money while he waits for the official decision on his asylum application. His monthly intake may be a tiny fraction of an average German wage, but Zaid takes on his job with a big smile. "It allows me to have contact with the German volunteers who come here to distribute meals, and gives me a chance to speak the language," said Zaid who fled the city of Hilla, about 100 kilometres south of Baghdad, along with his father and sister six months ago. "And I don't have to stand around in the centre not knowing what to do," he said. With authorities often taking weeks, if not months, to process asylum applications, many refugees are bored out of their minds as they are not allowed to take on regular employment during that time. To get around the problem, authorities have decided to make use of the one-euro job solution. Conceived a decade ago with the aim of nudging the long-term unemployed back to work, it is now being used to help integrate a record influx of refugees, which topped 1.1 million in 2015. The city of Berlin currently employs 3,925 refugees who are lodged in 75 centres, and wants to widen the offer to associations that offer public service such as charities helping the homeless or rehabilitative shelters for alcoholics. In Bavaria, the main gateway for thousands of refugees in southern Germany, 9,000 refugees have taken up such jobs. The city of Hanover also offers newcomers the possibility of working in bicycle repair, or sorting donated clothes, or accompanying kindergarten children in exchange for German language classes. Labour Minister Andrea Nahles has promised to create 100,000 such posts for refugees, describing them as a "trampoline" into the job market. "In the short term, it makes sense because the refugees can't otherwise work," Ronald Bachmann, economist at the RWI institute told AFP. "Having them at work also sends a good political signal," he said, as anti-migrant populism surges in tandem with Germany's record refugee influx. Nevertheless, Bachmann noted that the one-euro jobs had not proven particularly successful in their original task of getting the long-term unemployed back to work. "It was very, very rare that they helped to bring them back to a job market as one learns very little from such jobs," said Bachmann. The head of the German Federation of Unions, Reiner Hoffmann, also spoke out against placing refugees in such jobs as he believed that Germany needs a far more ambitious programme to integrate the newcomers into the economy. Holger Schaefer, an expert in the job market at IW institute, similarly had harsh words for the programme, saying "we are in fact subsidizing the exclusion of refugees from the job market". In any case, Zaid has no intention of pursuing his budding career in the restaurant business. He has just signed up for a class in a Berlin high school which should help him to resume his studies in IT, which had been abruptly halted in Iraq.</text>

	<text>PARIS: A police car was set ablaze in Paris on Wednesday after an angry crowd surrounded the vehicle as tensions ran high over accusations of police brutality against protesters, police officials and witnesses said. The police officers who were inside fled. The incident occured on a central Paris street a few hundred metres from where law enforcement officers were staging a rally to vent frustration over near daily clashes with violent gangs on the fringes of protests against labour law reform. Witnesses and police officials said the police officers were forced to abandon the car when a smoke bomb was thrown inside by people chanting "police everywhere, justice nowhere". Hours earlier, protesters complaining of police brutality in the confrontations of recent weeks were prohibited from holding a counter-demonstration at the site where the police rally was taking place. Wednesday's main action involved strikes by French rail and port workers which slashed train services and ferry connections to Britain as labour unions lead a week of protests aimed at forcing President Francois Hollande's government into retreat. Hollande's planned reforms aim to make it easier to hire and fire people. The government hopes they will boost employment but opponents argue they expose workers to worsening working conditions and reduced job security. More than 300 police officers have been injured in several weeks of confrontations, mostly with violent gangs of hooded and masked rioters hurling firebombs and paving stones.</text>

	<text>PARIS: The girl, speaking in the lilting accent of southern France, appeared in government ads describing how she was recruited by Islamic State extremists during her quest for religion, then encouraged to quit school and go to Syria, and finally to plot a suicide attack against a synagogue at home. "I have a hard time even admitting now that I was indoctrinated," she says to the camera in the ad before breaking down, describing how she tried to recruit others. The teen, known as Lea, was meant to be the poster child of a nascent program in France aimed at de-radicalizing young people to stem their flow to Syria. But the jihadi rehab didn't work. Six times she reconnected with the extremists, and six times she called her counselor in tears to apologize. The seventh time, late in 2015, landed her in jail. France's effort is one of many around the world trying to break the hold Muslim radicals have on their recruits by figuring out what drew them to the groups in the first place. The United States has launched its first formal effort in Minnesota, on the orders of a federal judge. But it's not clear how effective the programs can be in the long term. France alone has nearly 2,000 people like Lea about 600 who have left for Syria, but far more who are involved in jihadi networks at home. Across Europe, an estimated 5,000 people have joined extremist fighters in Syria, and about a third of them have returned. Most, experts and government officials say, will cause no harm. Dounia Bouzar, who runs France's jihadi rehab program, works with more than 1,000 young people flagged as potential extremists. Lea's story, she said, is more the rule than the exception. Islamic State and al-Qaida extremists don't break off contact just because someone is caught and the young people themselves have a hard time pulling away from what she described as their 'online tribe.' "A young person who reconnects, that's normal," she said. "Monday, they come to bear witness and save others. Wednesday, they denounce someone who wants to leave and say, save him. And Friday, they re-connect and threaten your life." There is no reasoning with someone in the thrall of a jihadi group, those who run the program say, so the recruits have to experience tangible doubts about the jihadi promises they once believed. Bouzar said that can mean countering a message of anti-materialism by showing them the videos of fighters lounging in fancy villas or sporting watches with an Islamic State logo. Or finding someone who has returned from Syria to explain that instead of offering humanitarian aid, the extremists are taking over entire villages, sometimes lacing them with explosives. Only once doubts are seeded can young would-be jihadis themselves reason their way back to their former selves, she said. In the United States, a young Minnesota man who admitted he planned to go Syria to join the Islamic State group is among the first to take part in Minnesota's de-radicalization program, the first of its kind in the United States. In early 2014, just after turning 18, Abdullahi Mohamud Yusuf applied for a fast-track passport with a vague plan to go to Istanbul. He was stopped at the airport in May 2014, but remained free. He enrolled in community college, got a job, then was arrested in November that year on two terrorism charges for trying to join Islamic State. Yusuf, now 20, stayed in a halfway house while his case was pending and remained there after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He went back to jail after a box cutter was found beneath his bed. His lawyer says his client did not know anything about it. The program enlists the expertise of Daniel Koehler, a German researcher who works with would-be jihadis and their families. In the U.S., participants are already charged with terrorism offenses, and the goal is to assess their risk of backsliding and give them the tools to keep from slipping back into the networks that once drew them in. It's a form of psychological warfare, he said before leaving to evaluate the Minnesota suspects. What neither Koehler nor Bouzar will offer is immunity from charges. In the case of the Minnesota program, participants are already in the federal justice system. The program is initially being offered to Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. In France, Bouzar only deals with people who have not travelled to Syria. Nearly all the jihadis who return from the war zone are mostly voluntary and numbering around 250. The are jailed immediately. This is a sore subject for her, because, as she puts it "we just run after those who have repented" to offer the most persuasive arguments against joining. "I think the government is afraid of being manipulated," said Bouzar, who has an annual budget of around 600,000 euros ($676,000). "At the same time, I think for most of those who returned, it's because they saw the reality and it didn't correspond to their dreams. There's nothing better than someone who has escaped Daesh." That is why she placed so much hope in Lea's recovery, even though she knew the risk that Lea would reconnect with recruiters. One unexpected voice to emerge is that of Mourad Benchellali, a French former Guantanamo inmate cleared of terror links who now lectures to groups of young people throughout France and Belgium, including in Brussels' Molenbeek neighborhood, home to so many of the Paris and Brussels attackers. Benchellali, who was captured in 2001 after being misled into a trip that landed him in an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan, recounts his five years of imprisonment without rancor. And it's the lack of bitterness that may resonate the most. He has returned to the French prison where he was held after being released from Guantanamo, this time to persuade inmates not to turn to violent extremism. French prisons in particular have been pilloried as breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism. In Molenbeek, he has talked to a population of young people of immigrant backgrounds who feel cut off from mainstream Belgians. He said many in the West just think of violent punishment like beheading and cutting off hands when they hear about Islamic Sharia law. "The problem is that reality is more complicated. Sharia is above all a complete system. It's a political system, a judicial system, an entire system. Everyone has a role to play," Benchellali said at a recent round table on radicalization. "So they have a real alternative. It's not just getting married. They're being offered an entire new life when they arrive. They get a new worth." That is especially true for those already caught up in a spiral of crime, unemployment and alienation, said Steve Lambert, a Brussels lawyer linked to jihadi cases. "Carrying out an attack is an exit strategy by default, after being closed off by all the failures you've caused in your life," Lambert said. "Nothing is simple and there are no absolutes, but there has to be a solution," he added. "Every time we harden ourselves, we create new martyrs for the cause." Finding out what motivates the slide into violent extremism is crucial to instilling doubts and ultimately changing minds, as is a risk assessment, said Koehler, who has worked directly with several dozen families in six countries. The French de-radicalization sessions are conducted in rented rooms, the five participants only told the location 10 minutes in advance because, Bouzar said, Islamic State recruiters "are hounding them, trying to geo-locate us. No cellphones are allowed." In Minnesota, the program started in April with risk evaluations of Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terror charges. Koehler evaluated their level of engagement in terror activities and chances of relapsing, and the federal judge overseeing their cases will use that information and other factors to determine their sentences. Koehler will also come up with recommendations, such as counseling or mentoring, to keep these men on the right track. The judge could use those recommendations as conditions of the men's parole meaning they could be taken back into custody if they don't follow the program. In March, U.S. District Judge Michael Davis said the program could also be expanded to other terror defendants, including those being released from prison and re-entering society. The goal is to keep the community safe while helping the young men become productive members of society. Koehler will also train U.S. probation and pretrial officers, who will be responsible for supervising the defendants once they are out of prison. But on the minds of law enforcement are cases like that of a young Frenchman known as Abu Oussama, seen in extraordinary hidden camera footage captured by an undercover documentary filmmaker. Flagged to police by his father, detained in Turkey trying to reach Syria, he was imprisoned in France for five months until authorities determined he was no longer a danger, he says. Yet the young man says he is plotting an attack on his homeland. "They said since I was de-radicalized, since I was quiet..." he says, giggling toward the camera he cannot see. "It's all part of the ruse, brother."</text>

	<text>OSLO: As the commander of a Cold War submarine tracking the Soviets, John Jeanette's dresses were stashed away in a locker reserved for top-secret documents. Soon, this former Norwegian navy captain will be recognised for what she is, a woman born in a man's body. Under a proposed new bill hailed by activists as one of the most liberal in the world, people who want to change gender in Norway would no longer be required to undergo any physical transformation. No more humiliating psychiatric exams, no lengthy hormone treatments and invasive surgeries resulting in irreversible sterilisations that have been the practice for a legal gender change in Norway since the 1970s. All you would have to do is notify authorities, a click on a website would suffice, to change your legal gender if the bill becomes law. The legislation, which activists hope will be voted on by parliament before the summer break, has met little opposition. "All my life, I had to show that I was a boy, then a man. I played the role of macho. I had a nice thick beard, exactly as was expected," says John Jeanette Solstad Remo, who picked a first name emphasising her trans identity. "But when I look like a man, even though I can function, life is grey. When I look like a woman, it's the opposite, there are lots of colours in my head and around me," adds the 67-year-old ex-submarine captain. "No one other than me can decide who I am and this law recognises this right," she commented. Dressed in a black skirt and a pale green top and matching scarf, her brown bob framing her face, Remo recalls a lifetime of uphill battles. Her memories range from the joy of wearing girls' clothes at the age of four and being immediately stifled by her mother, to suicidal thoughts in her teens after being outed by other youths. She also remembers trying to fit in while hiding her true self in the virile world of the naval academy and the submarine corps. "When we called at port, we often stayed in hotels. I would buy a bottle of wine, I'd watch TV and I stayed in my room, dressed as a woman. It was the only way to survive," says Remo, who has not undergone gender reassignment surgery. Her first marriage ended after her unwitting wife found a bag of women's clothes hidden in the cellar. Remo remarried, this time to a woman who accepted her as she was. She exclaimed, "The trans that I am is sort of a third person in our relationship." While times have changed in Norway, and public opinion too, daily life can still be problematic when it comes to borrowing a book at the library, getting a prescription filled, or crossing borders with identification papers that don't match one's physical appearance. Still listed as a personality disorder by the World Health Organisation, transgenderism stirs up emotions internationally. A North Carolina law that requires transgender people to use the restroom corresponding to the sex on their birth certificates has sparked angry protests, from Bruce Springsteen to Deutsche Bank, and a heated debate between US Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Argentina is a pioneer in the field, having allowed people since 2012 to choose their own legal gender without previously having reassignment surgery. But life expectancy for the Latin American country's transgenders is no more than 35 years, according to a study by the Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgenders of Argentina. It said they were often ostracised by society, facing discrimination and a lack of access to jobs and housing for example, that left them increasingly desperate. "The law is one thing but you also have to really change attitudes," says Patricia Kaatee of Amnesty International, which fights for the rights of transgender people. Norway's bill also allows minors aged six to 16 to change their gender if both parents agree. If one parent opposes, authorities may decide "in the child's best interest." "The law will make things easier for us. We won't have to always prepare everything in advance before going anywhere. There are already so many things to explain," says Sofie Brune, a mother of two who lives in Oslo. Her second child Miria was born six years ago in a girl's body but has identified as a boy since a very young age. So it's only natural that he now plays on the local boy's football team, and he's treated as a boy in school. "He's happy. That's what's most important. Children around him are very tolerant once we explain" the situation, Sofie says. For transgender people, the most important thing is to be able to live their lives the way they want. Transgender Frida Haslund said, "I don't want to be buried without ever having been myself."</text>

	<text>MADRID: Nudists have lost a seven-year legal battle for access to a popular tourist resort beach on Spain's southwestern tip. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the Spanish Federation of Naturism against local government legislation prohibiting nudists to use beaches within the historic port city of Cadiz. The federation had argued that nudism could be considered a fundamental right to freedom of ideology as defended by Spain's constitution. The court disagreed, saying in a ruling Friday that local authorities of Cadiz had the power to "manage properly the use of its services, equipment, infrastructure, facilities and public spaces.'' It said the federation had failed to make a convincing case that nudism was "at this moment, an accepted practice by the majority of beachgoers.'' The ruling applies to the beaches that fringe the ancient city but nudists are permitted to use a beach outside city limits. The federation had argued that Cadiz's city council had tried to roll back "the social progress'' Spain had made in recent decades by allowing nude beachgoers to be fined up to 750 euros ($840). Cadiz became one of Spain's wealthiest cities and was among the world's busiest ports when it got the monopoly for trade with the New World after Christopher Columbus discovered America. Gold and silver from Spain's empire flowed though Cadiz's docks, turning the city into the architectural gem that tourists flock to visit today. Spain also gained a reputation as an easygoing beach destination in the 1950s after the mayor of Benidorm asked dictator Gen. Francisco Franco to stop police from harassing and issuing fines to women for wearing bikinis on the town's beaches.</text>

	<text>THE HAGUE: Interpol and its European counterpart today warned of growing concerns that radical Islamists could be using illegal people smuggling networks to sneak into Europe or even fund their attacks and activities. "There is a growing concern that illegal immigration routes and networks may be used by radicalised foreign fighters wishing to return to the EU, or by terrorist organisations as a source of funding for their activities." Although no regular links between criminal gangs and terror groups have been proven "some incidents have been identified involving terrorists who have made use of migratory flows to enter the EU." It pointed to the November 13 attacks in Paris, after which it was revealed that two of the attackers had entered Europe through Greece as part of an influx of refugees from Syria. In a joint report unveiled on Tuesday, the two police agencies said those preying on desperate refugees had raked in up to $6 billion (5.2 billion euros) last year. That had turned the migrant flow into one of the largest money-earners for organised crime on the continent. "Terrorists may use migrant smugglers' resources to achieve their goals," said the report by the global police body Interpol based in Lyon and Europol in The Hague. More than a million people snuck into the European Union in 2015, most of them fleeing conflicts in the Middle East as well as poverty in Africa. "More than 90 percent of all migrants reaching the European Union use the facilitation services of a migrant smuggling network at some point throughout their journey," said Europol director Rob Wainwright, "This is a clear indication that organised crime networks are profiting from mass migration." The report calculated that each migrant had "paid an average of USD 3,200 to 6,500 (EUR 3,000- 6,000)". "This would result in an average turnover of USD 5 to 6 billion in 2015." Both agencies warned that in the future "an increase in the number of migrants trying to reach the EU is expected." "In Libya alone, around 800,000 migrants are waiting to travel to the EU," it said.</text>

	<Heading>Terror attack most likely scenario for Egyptair disappearance: Experts</Heading>

	<text>PARIS: Several scenarios could explain the mysterious disappearance of the Egyptair flight between Paris to Cairo early Thursday, but experts say a terrorist attack is the most likely. Both France and Egypt have been leading targets for Islamist extremists in recent months. In October, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for bombing an A321 plane belonging to Russian charter company Metrojet that crashed into the Sinai desert on its way from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St Petersburg, killing 224 passengers and crew. Experts say the chances of a mechanical malfunction in the case of Thursday's Egyptair disappearance are slim. "A major technical fault  the explosion of a motor, for instance  seems improbable," said aeronautics expert Gerard Feldzer, underlining that the A320 in question was "relatively new", having entered service in 2003. In addition, the A320 has an excellent safety record as the best-selling, medium-range airliner in the world. An A320 takes off or lands every 30 seconds around the world, Feldzer said. "It's a modern plane, the incident happened in mid-flight in extremely stable conditions. The quality of the maintenance and the quality of the plane are not in question in this incident," Jean-Paul Troadec, former director of France's aviation Bureau of Investigation and Analysis, told Europe 1 radio. Egyptair "is a company with authorisation to operate in Europe, so it is not on any blacklist," he added. Experts also say it is unlikely that the plane was shot down from the ground, as was the case with the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 that went down over Ukraine in July 2014, or from the sea as occurred in July 1988 when the US Navy blew up an Iran Air passenger flight by mistake. The Egyptair plane was flying at 37,000 feet (11,000 metres) and disappeared about 130 nautical miles off the Greek island of Karpathos. That would put it out of reach of portable rocket launchers used by several militant groups in the Middle East. "We cannot exclude the possibility that it was shot down by another aircraft by mistake, but it is likely we would already know," said Feldzer. The region around northern Egypt, including the Israeli and Gazan coastlines, is "one of the most monitored regions in the world, including by satellite. It would be very difficult to hide this kind of information," he added. That leaves a terrorist attack as the most likely possibility, not least because it appears that no distress signal was sent from the aircraft. "A technical problem, a fire or a motor malfunction, doesn't cause an instantaneous accident and the crew has time to react," said Troadec. "Here, the crew didn't say anything." If a bombing is established, the question for investigators will be how a device was smuggled aboard a flight taking off from France's busiest airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle, where security has been on high alert since last year's jihadist attacks in the French capital. "A bomb placed on board at Roissy or in Cairo is always possible because it's difficult to make your airport 100 percent watertight, even in an airport with such tight surveillance as Roissy (Charles de Gaulle)," said Feldzer. "The first thing to do is to recover debris that will give us some indications on the accident... to see if there are any traces of explosives."</text>

	<text>VERBANIA: As a young woman in the roaring 1920s, the world's oldest living person loved to go singing and dancing. Now 116-year-old Italian Emma Morano's next challenge is to see in the 2020s and become the oldest human being on record . The last known surviving child of the 19th century is enjoying the spotlight after succeeding American Susannah Mushatt Jones, who died last week, as the oldest person on the planet. And on the evidence of AFP's visit to her this weekend, Morano could very well go on long enough to surpass Jeanne Calment's record. The Frenchwoman died in 1997 at 122 years and 164 days, the oldest recorded age achieved by a human being. Morano was having the first of her two daily naps when AFP came calling at her tiny second-storey apartment in Verbania, a small town on the shores of Lake Maggiore in northern Italy. But her carer had no doubt that she would want to have her picture taken once again. Barely a few seconds after being woken, she was alert, sitting up on the edge of her bed and smiling for the camera. Clutching an embroidered pillow she received when she celebrated her 116th birthday in 2015, she spoke in a barely audible but unwavering voice. "I'm doing fine, who are you?" she said, confirming comments from her doctor and her few surviving relatives that becoming a world-beater has boosted her already remarkable vitality. Morano's extraordinary longevity, more broadly Italy's high number of centenarians, is a subject of much fascination among scientists. The eldest of eight children, Morano was born on November 29, 1899. She has outlived all her younger siblings, the last sister having died five years ago at the age of 102. She is now looked after by two elderly nieces with the help of a Colombian carer. Morano cannot walk, does not see well enough to watch television and has reportedly not left her flat in 25 years. For most of that time, Morano has been visited once a week by her doctor, Carlo Bava, who broke the record-breaking news to her and reported that his patient had been extremely proud to hear it. Bava has helped draw the world's attention to the unconventional diet which has underpinned his patient from living to such an old age. Contrary to all received medical wisdom, Morano has thrived despite largely eschewing vegetables in favour of a diet that features at least one raw egg a day and regular portions of raw minced steak. Her liking for pure protein goes along with a sweet tooth: she enjoys late night snacks of apple puree and biscuits and visitors often come bearing Colomba, an egg and butter-rich cake Italians associate with Easter, or Pannetone and Pandoro, traditional Christmas treats of a similar ilk. In an interview in 2015 Morano attributed her longevity to having left a violent husband in 1938, shortly after the death in infancy of her only son. It was always an unhappy marriage. Years before, her true love had gone off to fight in World War One and never came back. Leaving a husband was no easy thing to do in the Church-dominated Italy of the 1930s and Morano had no choice but to work in a factory producing jute sacks to support herself. The egg habit dates from when she was diagnosed with anaemia at 20 and a doctor advised her to eat three a day, two raw and one cooked. She maintained that regime for 90 years and she remains a creature of habit, rising at eight every day, lunching at 11 and having dinner at six. Both main meals are followed by long naps and Morano retires, after her snack, every night at 11.00pm. It is a routine she intends to maintain, she said on her 116th birthday in November. "I'm fine, I'm fine and as long as it stays like that I will remain with you," she said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON/KABUL: Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a rare US drone strike deep inside Pakistan, the Afghan spy agency announced on Sunday. Mansour's death is a body blow for the insurgents and removes a major obstacle to the fragile peace process in war-torn Afghanistan. Mansour and another militant were targeted by multiple unmanned aircraft operated by US Special Operations forces on Saturday as the duo rode in a vehicle in a remote area near the town of Ahmad Wal in the restive Baluchistan province close to the Afghan border, US officials said. Afghanistan's main spy agency said Mansour was killed in a US drone attack inside Pakistan. "Mansour was being closely monitored for a while ... until he was targeted along with other fighters aboard a vehicle ... in Balochistan," the National Directorate of Security said in a brief statement. Speaking to reporters in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw, US secretary of state John Kerry said, "Mansour posed ... an imminent threat to US personnel, Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces." Kerry said Mansour was also directly opposed to peace negotiations. The US "has long maintained that an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned reconciliation process is the surest way to ensure peace ... peace is what we want, Mansour was a threat to that," Kerry added. The Pentagon earlier confirmed it targeted Mansour, said to be in his early 50s, in an operation authorized by President Barack Obama. The deaths of Taliban leaders have sometimes been falsely reported. Mansour himself was said to have been killed last December. Mansour assumed the leadership in July 2015, replacing Taliban founder and the one-eyed reclusive long-time spiritual head Mullah Mohammad Omar in Pakistan in 2013. "Mansour has been the leader of the Taliban and actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners," said Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook. "Mansour has been an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, prohibiting Taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the Afghan government that could lead to an end to the conflict," he said. The drone strike inside Pakistan was a rare one since US Navy Seals killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden in a stealth raid in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in 2011. "Since the death of Mullah Omar and Mansour's assumption of leadership, the Taliban have conducted many attacks that have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces as well as numerous US and Coalition personnel," Cook said. The United States informed both Pakistan and Afghanistan shortly after the strike, a senior White House official said.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif asked parliament on Monday to form a commission to investigate allegations stemming from the Panama Papers leak but opposition lawmakers walked out, saying he had evaded questions about his family's affairs. Sharif has been under pressure since documents released as part of the Panama Papers data leak showed his children owned several off-shore companies and used them to buy properties in London. He denies wrongdoing, as do his children. The opposition has seized on the Panama Papers scandal as a fresh opportunity to try to unseat Sharif, who told parliament that his wealth was acquired legally in the decades before he entered politics and no money was siphoned offshore. "I can say with surety that ... not a single penny went out of Pakistan," Sharif told the parliament. Sharif asked the opposition and other lawmakers to help form a parliamentary commission. Previous efforts to have a retired or sitting Supreme Court judge chair a judicial commission have stalled as all the judges rejected the offer. It is not clear if the opposition will take up Sharif's latest offer. They walked out soon after Sharif stopped speaking, angered that seven questions they posed to him ahead of the parliamentary session were not answered. "Not a single question has been answered by the PM," said Khursheed Shah, leader of the opposition in the National Assembly. Imran Khan, leader of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, said, "We didn't need to hear such a long story. He could have shown the documents as I have done so." Opposition politicians said they would announce on Tuesday their response to Sharif's speech. Analysts say opposition attacks on Sharif have lost some of their bite since Khan on Friday admitted he once owned an off-shore company to buy a London flat and avoid paying British taxes. The leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm has captured global attention, uncovering among other things the use of off-shore businesses by wealthy individuals and corporations worldwide. While such off-shore companies are often not illegal per se, their use spurs suspicions of illegal activity, such as money-laundering, corruption, and tax evasion.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif has said that Islamabad would explore other options to meet its defence needs, if the F-16 deal did not materialise with the United States. Asif asserted that Pakistan was an independent and sovereign state and it could acquire defence related products from other suitable markets of the world, reports the Express Tribune. He spoke to Media after addressing a two-day international conference titled 'Refugee crisis and its ramifications for global and national security' organised by South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (SASSI) University in collaboration with the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), National Security Division and Konrad Adenauer Stiftung. Highlighting that ups and downs in the bilateral relations between Islamabad and Washington was not an unusual matter, Asif said that overall ties between the two nations were better. Pressing that Shakeel Afridi was a Pakistani citizen, the defence minister said that Afridi would be tried in Pakistani courts and that no one would be allowed to interfere in internal matters of the country. He also said that durable peace in Afghanistan was of great importance for Pakistan. Pakistan may use F-16s against India, review sale, US lawmakers tell Obama Top US lawmakers have expressed concerns over the Obama administration's decision to sell eight F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, saying the aircrafts could be used against India and not in combating terrorism.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Pakistan's powerful Army chief Gen Raheel Sharif met top Chinese leaders and military officials here and discussed ways to enhance bilateral economic and security ties. Gen Sharif, who is in China on a two-day official visit, on Monday met Premier Li Keqiang and vice-president of the Central Military Commission Fan Changlong, the highest military official of the People's Liberation Army which is headed by President Xi Jinping. Li met Sharif on Monday to enhance bilateral economic and security ties, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday. Military-to-military relations have reinforced China-Pakistan ties, especially economic cooperation, Li said, calling on both sides to strengthen high-level contact and deepen exchanges in various fields. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC), estimated to cost about USD 46 billion, is not only a flagship project between the two sides, but also conducive to development and prosperity of the whole region, Li said. On his part, Sharif appreciated Pakistan's profound friendship with China and stressed that the Pakistani side expects achievements from the CEPC and is ready to provide security for cooperation. Pakistan military spokesman Lt Gen Asim Bajwa said Gen Sharif discussed with Chinese officials the measures to improve military cooperation, exponentially enhance training exchanges, defence technology and intelligence sharing and security of the CEPC. Sharif's visit to Beijing comes in the backdrop of assertions by Pakistan that it will raise its concerns at the international level over India's successful test of supersonic interceptor missile. His trip followed last month's visit of defence minister Manohar Parrikar who held extensive talks with top Chinese leaders and military officials. Expressing concern over India's interceptor missile test, adviser to the Prime Minister on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz said it will disturb the balance of power in the region. He added that Pakistan will continue to upgrade its defensive capabilities by acquiring advanced technology. India is enjoying the cooperation of the US, as Washington thinks a strong New Delhi is vital to contain China, he was quoted as saying by the Dawn. Pakistan would raise its voice at the international level against these developments, Aziz said. Pakistan is also peeved over the US refusal to finance eight F-16s fighter jets. Also, the India-China ties too faced problems over Beijing blocking New Delhi's move in the UN to ban Pakistan- based Jaish-e-Muhammad chief Masood Azhar, who is accused of masterminding the Pathankot terrorist attack.</text>

	<text>LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan has admitted that he formed an offshore company to buy the London flat in 1983 to evade British taxes. According to Dawn, when speaking to reporters at London Heathrow Airport, Imran said that he formed the offshore firm on the advice of his accountant to evade taxes during his playing days to buy a flat in London. "I was already paying 35 per cent tax on my income there, so to evade further taxes, I bought the flat through an offshore firm, which was my right as I was not a British citizen," Imran told the reporters. Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Naeemul Haq also admitted that Khan had formed a 'legal' offshore company through his earnings from cricket. "I was Imran Khan's bank manager in London at that time, his accountants formed this company to buy the London flat," said the PTI spokesman. He added that when the flat was sold, Imran brought the money to Pakistan through Habib Bank. Imran Khan had severely criticised Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family for owning and benefiting from offshore companies after the ICIJ investigation which led to the release of Panama papers revealing offshore accounts of the rich and mighty across the world. He, along with other opposition leaders, demanded the prime minister to resign until the issue is investigated and the premier gets a clean chit.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: In a startling admission, a senior minister in Pakistan's Punjab province said the government cannot take legal action against militant groups like Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) as the "state itself remained involved" with them. In an interview to BBC Urdu, Punjab law minister Rana Sanaullah was asked why legal action has never been taken against anti-India groups in the province which were close to the "establishment". "By pro-establishment groups if you mean JuD and JeM, then let me tell you that they have been declared proscribed organisations and they can no longer carry out any activity in the province," he said. The minister ruled out the possibility of any legal action against the groups saying "How can you prosecute a group with whom the state itself has been involved with?". India accuses Pakistan of patronising terror groups like JuD and JeM who carry out attacks in the country. Pakistan however denies the charge calling them "non-state actors" who are not in its control. The candid admission by Sanaullah about the Pakistani state's past ties with JuD and JeM may increase international pressure on the country to act against all militants groups including the Haqqani network active in Afghanistan.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday said that it has formally applied for the membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, after China blocked India's entry into the 48-member elite group. The Foreign Office (FO) said that Pakistan's ambassador in Vienna on Thursday applied for the membership through a letter addressed to the NSG chairman. In the letter, Pakistan said the decision to seek participation in the export-control regime reflects Pakistan's strong support for international efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. "Pakistan has the expertise, manpower, infrastructure, as well as the ability to supply NSG controlled items, goods and services for a full range of nuclear applications for peaceful uses," the Foreign Office said. It said Pakistan attaches high priority to nuclear safety and security. It has taken legal, regulatory and administrative measures to bring nuclear safety and security at par with international standards. READ ALSO: India says no need to sign NPT for NSG membership "Pakistan's export-control regime is underpinned by strong legislation, regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. The national export control lists are harmonized with the control lists of NSG, MTCR and Australia Group," it said. The development comes as China harps on the need for consensus in the NSG, where it is reportedly pushing for Pakistan's entry despite US' strong backing for India to join the elite body that seeks reducing nuclear proliferation by controlling the export and re-transfer of materials. READ ALSO: I will make China behave if I become president, says Trump Pakistan has stressed the need for NSG to adopt a non-discriminatory criteria-based approach for NSG membership of the countries, which have never been party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India, Pakistan, Israel and South Sudan were the four UN member states which have not signed the NPT, the international pact aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. The Foreign Office said Pakistan's NSG membership will further NSG non-proliferation objectives by the inclusion of a state with nuclear supply capabilities and its adherence to NSG Guidelines and best practices on supply of controlled items, goods, materials, technologies and services. Through an official note, Pakistan has informed the IAEA Director-General of its adherence to the objectives of NSG and its decision to act in accordance with NSG Guidelines with regard to transfer of nuclear material, equipment and related technology, including related dual-use equipment, materials, software and related technology.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: The US, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China will meet in Islamabad on May 18 to discuss a roadmap for negotiating a peace deal with the Afghan Taliban to end the 15-year insurgency, amid a surge in violence in the war-torn country. It would be the first meeting since the Quadrilateral Coordination Group ( QCG ) met in Kabul on February 23 and announced talks would start in the first week of March, but the process could not begin as Taliban refused to join. Official sources said special envoys of China and the US and senior officials of Pakistan and Afghanistan were expected to attend the meeting schedule on May 18 in Islamabad. "The group would discuss how to make more concerted efforts for peace talks to start," said the sources. Initially the group was supposed to meet after the consultation between Taliban and Afghan officials. But the process ran a dead end following the terrible Kabul bombing last month which killed more than 64 people. The Express Tribune reported that Afghanistan wants the Taliban to be declared 'irreconcilable' as they have publicly refused to engage in talks. Afghan Ambassador to Islamabad, Omar Zakhilwal, said this on Sunday, ahead of the upcoming QCG meeting. "We expect the QCG meeting to agree on implementation of the roadmap the group had agreed upon in its meeting on February 6," Zakhilwal said while referring to the quartet call for the Taliban to shun violence and join direct talks by the first week of March. "The roadmap is precisely about the steps the QCG members were to take in their respective domains both during peace talks, if they commenced, as well as if the Taliban refused to join talks. Now since the Taliban have publicly refused to join talks and opted for more violence the second scenario is applicable," the daily quoted Zakhilwal as saying. "They must be declared 'irreconcilable' and action taken against them as was agreed in the roadmap," he added. Zakhiwal travelled to Kabul following his meeting with Pakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif where they agreed to reopen the Torkham border crossing. The border remained closed for four days after Afghan security forces objected to the fencing of the border by Pakistani authorities. After years of denial, the Pakistani government recently admitted that the Taliban leadership enjoys safe haven inside the country. Taliban insurgents in recent months have repeatedly seized control of parts of the more than 2,000-mile-long Ring Road network, which connects major Afghan population centres.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Pakistan's powerful army chief Gen Raheel Sharif met top Chinese leadership here and assured them to provide full security to the ambitious $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through restive Balochistan province. General Sharif, who is in China on a two-day official visit, on Monday met Premier Li Keqiang and vice President of the Central Military Commission Fan Changlong, the highest military official of the People's Liberation Army which is headed by President Xi Jinping. During his meeting with Li, Sharif appreciated Pakistan's profound friendship with China and stressed that the Pakistani side expects achievements from the CPEC and is ready to provide security for cooperation. General Sharif discussed with Chinese officials the measures to improve military cooperation, exponentially enhance training exchanges, defence technology and intelligence sharing and security of the CPEC, Pakistan military spokesman Lt Gen Asim Bajwa said. Li met Sharif to enhance bilateral economic and security ties, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported today. Military-to-military relations have reinforced China-Pakistan ties, especially economic cooperation, Li said, calling on both sides to strengthen high-level contact and deepen exchanges in various fields. The economic corridor is not only a flagship project between the two sides, but also conducive to development and prosperity of the whole region, Li said. Pakistan is readying a special force of 4,000 security personnel to protect Chinese nationals working at various projects in Punjab province, including the CPEC project. Already over 17,000 security personnel from the army and other security forces have been engaged to ensure foolproof security of Chinese nationals working across the country. The ambitious 3,000-kilometre CPEC project was launched last year to link western China to southern Pakistan through a network of roads, railways and pipelines. Sharif's trip to Beijing followed last month's visit of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar who held extensive talks with top Chinese leaders and military officials. His visit comes in the backdrop of assertions by Pakistan that it will raise its concerns at the international level over India's successful test of supersonic interceptor missile.

	<text>WASHINGTON: The US is committed to maintaining its "important" and "vital" relationship with Pakistan, the Obama Administration said amid reports of strains in bilateral ties. "It is an important, vital relationship that we strongly believe in. Is it complicated at times? Absolutely it is. And do we see eye-to-eye on every issue with Pakistan? No, we don't," state department spokesman, John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference. "But that's why the relationship matters so much because we have shared threats and shared concerns, shared interests in the region. And we're going to continue to work at it," he said. Kirby was responding to a question on the statement made by Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz that his country's relationship with the United States has been under stress for the past three months. Kirby said he has not seen the statement. "I didn't see his comments. So I'm going to refrain from responding specifically to that sentiment," he said. Kirby did not agree when asked if the US-Pakistan ties are not at the best of times these days. "It is an important relationship that we continue to work at very, very seriously. We're going to remain committed to. And I would not share that characterization of it," Kirby said.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday said it has expressed "serious concern" to the UN over a draft bill in the Indian Parliament over the map of Kashmir and called upon the world body to uphold its resolutions and urge India to stop such acts which are in "violation of international law". Wrong depiction of the map of India could land the violators in jail with a maximum term of seven years and impose a fine up to Rs 100 crore, according to the draft 'Geospatial Information Regulation Bill 2016'. "Pakistan has expressed serious concern to the United Nations secretary general and the President of the UN security council, through letters by our permanent representative in New York, with regard to the Indian government's efforts to introduce a controversial 'Geospatial Information Regulation Bill' in the Indian Parliament," the foreign office (FO) said. It further said that "in violation of UNSC resolutions, the official map of India has been depicting the disputed territory of Jammu &amp; Kashmir as part of India which is factually incorrect and legally untenable". Through the passage of this Bill, the Indian government would penalise the individuals and organisations who depict Jammu &amp; Kashmir as a disputed territory as per the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions, the FO said. "The letter calls upon the United Nations to uphold the UNSC resolutions and urge India to stop such acts which are in violation of international law," the FO said. "We have urged the international community and the United Nations to fulfill their commitment with the people of Jammu and Kashmir by holding an independent and impartial plebiscite under UN auspices," it said.</text>

The second bomb went off about half an hour later, after police and local TV crews arrived at the scene. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

	<text>WASHINGTON: Ignoring objections of the White House, the Republican majority House of Representatives has approved the National Defense Authorisation Act which blocks $450 million aid to Pakistan for failing to take action against the dreaded Haqqani network. The NDAA 2017 (H R 4909) was passed by the US House of Representative (277-147) on Wednesday night, which among others included approval of three major amendments reflecting the strong anti-Pak sentiment prevailing among the US lawmakers. As a result, as per the House version of the Bill, the Obama administration must certify that Pakistan has met before releasing $450 million in aid. "Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani network senior leaders and mid-level operatives". Congressman Dana Rohrabacher's amendment adds an additional requirement that the secretary of defense certify to Congress that Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the US to persecute minority groups seeking political or religious freedom. The NDAA-2017 also includes the sense of the Congress that Shakil Afridi is an international hero and that the government of Pakistan should release him immediately from prison. NDAA-2017 now needs to be passed by the Senate, before it can be sent to the White House for the US President Barack Obama to sign it into law. Early this week, the White House had expressed strong objections to several provisions of the bill, including the one related to $450 million in aid to Pakistan. "The administration objects to section 1212 (of HR 4919), which would make USD 450 million of CSF (Coalition Support Fund) to Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority unless the Secretary provides a certification to the Congressional defense committees," the White House said in its statement. "We share the committee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the Haqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the need for concerted action specifically against the group," the White House said. However, Congressman Mark Thornberry, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee late Wednesday night decided to ignore the White House's objection to this and asked the members of the House to approve these amendments in block, for which no voting took place. Speaking on the floor of the House, Congressman Ted Poe Last year, alleged that the Haqqani Network and the Taliban killed more Afghan civilians and troops than in any other year since the Taliban was toppled in 2001. "My amendment adds a fourth condition on the aid to Pakistan. This new condition requires the administration to certify that Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani Network senior leaders and mid-level operatives," he said. "This forces Pakistan to make a choice: either go after the Haqqani Network in a public way that it has never done before or lose hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid," Poe said. The amendment moved by Rohrabacher makes it mandatory for the administration to certify that Pakistan is not using its military or any funds or equipment provided by the United States to persecute minority groups "seeking political or religious freedom," including the Balochi, Sindhi, and Hazara ethnic groups and minority religious groups, including Christian, Hindu, and Ahmadiyya Muslim. "It is time to end this irrational support that we give to Pakistan," Rohrabacher demanded on the floor of the House arguing that the US has given more than $30 billion in aid since 2002. "It is only prudent that we increase certification required to release American military or economic aid to Pakistan," he said. "It behooves us not to finance Pakistan's brutal suppression of ethnic groups and religious minorities like the Baloch and the Sindhis who are under attack today simply for seeking their political and religious freedom," he said. "I would ask my colleagues to join with me and to stand also with the people around the world. Send a message: If you stand with the US, we will not forget you; we will stand with you. The people of the US and the US Congress stand tall with you and appreciate that youhave risked your lives in a way that saved American lives," Rohrabacher said.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today broke ground for the USD 44 million Pakistan-China Optical Fibre Cable project in PoK's Gilgit-Baltistan region which will provide an alternate telecommunication route between the two countries. The project is part of the ambitious USD 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which passes through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), linking western China to the strategic Gawadar port in southern Pakistan via a network of roads, railways and communication systems. The Optical Fibre Cable project will be completed in two years and Special Communication Organisation will lay 820-kilometre-long cable from Rawalpindi to Khunjrab, Radio Pakistan reported. On completion, the project will provide an alternate telecommunication route between Pakistan and China. Sharif also inaugurated the CPEC patrolling police headquarters in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The force comprising 300 personnel and 25 vehicles, gifted by China, will ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic on the 439-kilometre chunk of the 3,000-kilometre CPEC project. The CPEC passes through the restive Balochistan province. Pakistan is readying a special force of 4,000 security personnel to protect Chinese nationals working at various projects in Punjab province, including the CPEC project. Already more than 17,000 security personnel from the army and other security forces have been engaged to ensure fool-proof security to Chinese nationals. Its importance has increased since the launch of the CPEC project in 2015.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The Interpol has issued red corner notice against Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar and his brother Abdul Rauf for their alleged role in the conspiracy to attack the strategic Indian Air Force base in Pathankot . NIA had sought the red corner notice against Masood Azhar, his brother Abdul Rauf, Kashif Jan and Shahid Latif, two handlers of JeM terrorists who had infiltrated into India through Bamiyal sector of Punjab in the wee hours of December 30 to launch the terror assault. The strategic base was attacked by terrorists of banned JeM during the intervening night of January one and two in which seven security personnel were killed. Four bodies of terrorists were recovered from the encounter site which lasted for nearly 80 hours. NIA has already sought voice samples of Azhar and three others from Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team (JIT) which came to India for carrying out a probe in the Pathankot terror probe. India had built a strong case for proscribing Azhar as terrorist at the UN but the move was vetoed by China. An Interpol red corner notice is already pending against Azhar for being allegedly involved in the conspiracy behind attacks on Parliament and Jammu and Kashmir state assembly. Similarly an Interpol red corner notice is pending against Rauf in connection with the IC-814 hijacking case of 1999. India has complained to Pakistan about the slow pace of probe in the Parliament attack case and Azhar being given a free hand to continue with his anti-India rhetoric. Islamabad has not heeded to India's demands to bring to book Azhar and other JeM top brass. In the meantime, NIA said that after posting the pictures of the four dead terrorists on its official website, more information was coming from across the world which included many people from Pakistan who were eager to share details pertaining to the slain militants. The four terrorists were identified as Nasir Hussain (Punjab province), Abu Bakar, (Gujranwala), Umar Farooq and Abdul Qayum (both from Sindh). Read this story in Telugu</text>

	<text>Low-performers usually look for a boss who will treat every employee equally. A boss who doesn't know who is doing what, where, why, when or how, a boss who doesn't keep track and ignores performance problems . A boss who doesn't tell them what to do and how to do it and who doesn't spell out expectations but leaves them to their own devices. These employees collect their pay packets just as everyone else, regardless of their mediocre performance . In other words, they are the beneficiaries of undermanagement. And therein lies the importance of appraisals . They help to strategically review the strength, weaknesses and achievements of workers during the year, says Bruce Tulhan, author of "It's okay to Manage Your Boss". The title is catchy, it's specific, detailed and honest. Tulhan's warning that becoming a better manager is like starting a fitness programme couldn't have been more apt. The book advises you on how to engage your boss in your work, get clear directions from him and guides employees with tools and feedback for success. But he also says clearly that the book is meant for high-performers. He says that one needs to create a close, official relationship with every boss, no matter how great or awful he is, no matter how he is on any given day or how he himself performs. Tulhan charts out four basic things an employee must take responsibility for. They are: Clearly spelled-out and reasonable expectations with a concrete timetable; skills, tools and resources necessary to meet those expectations; accurate feedback about your performance as well as coursecorrecting direction and fair quid pro quo, ie, recognition and rewards in exchange for performance. There are also tips for keeping a close, official relationship with your coworkers. Tulhan is also able to shift the wheat from the chaff and says that though managers are demanding more and more from employees, they are also providing them with less guidance than ever before. But employees can improve their careers despite this lacunae. He debunks certain myths such as if you are a high-performer , then your boss shouldn't tell you how to do your work. This book is especially relevant in today's times when companies are cutting back on overhead expenses and staff as they ride out the financial crisis. Many of today's employees are overworked, often performing the job of two or three people for no additional pay. Research shows that many employees feel powerless and are not in a position to complain about their circumstances, holding on to the job the way one would cling to a lifeboat. It also talks about the epidemic of undermanagement, which is responsible for the precarious environment at the workplace. It is a well-researched book and a successful follow-up to Tulhan's earlier book "It is Okay to be Boss'' . And the bottomline is: It is okay to manage your boss if you are good.</text>

	<text>Mysuru: The women and child development department (WCD) is going all out to stop child marriages in the district. Besides the bride and bride groom's families, even those attending such marriage and facilitating it by letting out choultry will be booked under the Child Marriage Prohibition Act. The attendees will face Rs 1 lakh fine and two years jail. And there's also the possibility being booked under Pocso Act and facing minimum of seven years of imprisonment. K Radha, deputy director, WCD department, Mysuru district, said, "If it's found that the minor was pushed to have sex or if she becomes pregnant, those who attended and facilitated the marriage will be booked under the Pocso Act." In the past two years, the department stopped 216 child marriages in the district. However, no stringent action was taken against the violators. Now, the department will be going tough against such violators. Child marriages are common in poor and rural communities. They only perpetuate the cycle of poverty. More often than not, child brides are pulled out of school, depriving them of education and meaningful work. They suffer health risks associated with early sexual activity and child-bearing, leading to high rates of maternal and child mortality. "With the help of voluntary organizations we will try to create more awareness including by visiting schools and villages about the consequences of child marriage. In days to come, the punishment will be stringent and no one can escape from law," Radha told TOI. She said, "In 2012-13 and 2013-14, 35 and 21 child marriages were stopped respectively. The number increased in 2014-15 and 2015-16 as we managed to stop 111 and 105 child marriages across the district. More child marriages are found taking placer in Hunsur, KR Nagar and HD Kote taluks. Not only the bride and bride groom's families but also the priests, the attendees and those let out choultry for the marriage will be booked under the Child Marriage Prohibition Act." Dr Radhamani, superintendent, Cheluvamba Hospital, said: "Every month, around 1,200 deliveries happen in the hospital. About 5% are related to teenage pregnancy that is below 18 years of age. Abortion chances are high among teenage pregnancy. Besides, there are chances of preterm delivery, high BP and sugar and anaemia. Also there are chances of more health complication during delivery."</text>

	<text>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The cleaning staff of Trivandrum International Airport on Friday found 100g of gold inside an Air India Express aircraft parked in the hangar unit of the airport. Two 50g gold coins were found wrapped in carbon paper inside a ladies purse. It was during the maintenance work that the cleaning staff found the coins, which were handed over to customs unit at the airport. Though there were initial reports that the gold found from the aircraft was abandoned by someone who was trying to smuggle it to Kerala, the officials ruled that out. According to them, it was accidentally misplaced by some passengers and such things happened often. "The flight had been in the hanger unit for a few days. Wrapped in carbon paper the gold coins were found in a ladies' purse. The gold will be worth Rs 2.5 lakh and will be detained with customs unit," said an official from the customs unit at Trivandrum International Airport.</text>

	<text>'Sexy chick' roles, pay disparities, discrimination against female directors... sexism runs deep in Hollywood. A non-profit production company, We Do It Together, seeks to change all that with more powerful roles for women both on and off screen. As a member of its advisory board, Freida Pinto is at the Cannes Film Festival to announce its first project. The actor tells Sumeet Keswani about the stereotypes she has encountered and how she fought them At a time when feminism has percolated to the grassroots, how has sexism sustained itself in the upper echelons of Hollywood? Art imitates life. And if you look at the world around, there's a very strong element of sexism ingrained among people, even the most educated groups. I was watching this TED talk on infidelity by Esther Perel and it was very interesting to learn how sexism was actually glorified eons ago. I don't want to sound like a cynic but it would be too high an expectation to think it can disappear suddenly. But it's definitely time to do something about it, to at least curtail the impact of it on women. How will the non-profit address sexism? What's the first project? Although we're a non-profit film production company, we're not here for charity. While we as individuals are not looking to make any money, the box office proceeds from each venture will feed the next. The idea is to produce something exciting and entertaining. We don't want to tell stories of puritan, chaste women, but women who are as real and powerful as men. It's not just the stories, but also who's making them. In 2002, 7% of directors were female. It's 2016 now, and that number still stands at 7%. We're looking at female-driven stories made by female directors. Our first project is going to be a compilation of six to seven short stories. Each of these is a project that a female director or producer wanted to make. These will be released together as a feature film or TV series. One of them is a story I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to be producing it and acting in it too. Have you done any roles that you now feel catered to stereotypes? I have done many roles that were stereotypical! When I started off, I would think, 'If I don't take up this offer, maybe I won't get anything else.' When I took up Day of the Falcon, I wasn't very sure about the character. When I read it on paper, I wanted to give it a stronger presence. In the end, I didn't entirely go with my gut instinct. I can't tell others what to do but I personally have now come to a place in my life where if I'm offered a role that may be construed as sexist or degrading to women, I refuse to do it. I have the responsibility and power to say no. Any roles you've refused? I was offered a stereotypical role of an Indian call centre employee who spoke in a very desi accent. It also had a very disrespectful reference to the 2012 gang rape in Delhi. I immediately threw up my hands and refused the role. Any recent female characters that you have loved? Last year, Room was one of the most phenomenal movies. It was nice to get an insight into the life of a woman who was traumatized and wasn't the perfect mother at times, and that's fine. You shouldn't make a lesser film by telling the story of a perfect woman. Cate Blanchett's character in Blue Jasmine and Alicia Vikander's in The Danish Girl were also good to see. In Bollywood, Deepika's performance in Piku was refreshing. I'm working with Richa Chadha on Love Sonia. She's done a fair amount of powerful roles. And Shefali Shah is out of this world! I loved Kangana in Queen; she was vulnerable, funny and empowered all at the same time. Women aren't black and white all the time, and shouldn't be portrayed so. Actors like Cameron Diaz, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Olivia Wilde have brought up the issue of ageism in Hollywood. Your take on it? The issue very much exists. There's a disparity in the way men and women are viewed. For instance, Tom Cruise can be in his 50s and still be Ethan Hunt and romance 22-year-olds on screen. But when female actors hit 35 or 37, or god forbid the 40-mark, they are relegated to playing mothers or grandmothers  older characters who aren't sexually active anymore... all the female body parts suddenly disappear! We're still here, the same people having the same kind of fun men like to have. Female actors seem to have a shelf life in the industry. I personally feel that in my 30s, I'm more aware of who I am than I was in my 20s. Doesn't it mean I should get better roles now? But that's not the case. We want to address this issue by coming up with amazing stories of women well into their 40s, 50s, and 60s. They can be very entertaining as well. Has the issue of whitewashing affected you? Does your ethnicity dictate roles? From the very onset of my career, my team pushed out the message, 'Yes, she's Indian, but she's not interested in playing Indian roles only, especially not the stereotypical ones.' So I haven't faced that issue. As far as whitewashing goes, TV is way ahead of films in diversity. There's also a problem with the way Asian actors are cast. Filmmakers shouldn't add a token Indian girl for the sake of diversity; give her something real to do.</text>

	<text>It is hard to understand the Indian obsession with new capital cities. Since Independence, five states have chosen to build capitals at unimaginable expense, hardship to farmers and at a colossal waste of material resource, energy and manpower. Nowhere in the world do countries build whole cities from scratch when all that is required is a place to conduct the affairs of government. Countries that were born out of the breakup of Yugoslavia merely moved their capitals to places that had a long history and enough space to accommodate government functions. Zagreb became the capital of Croatia, Sarajevo of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Slovakia, born out of Czechoslovakia in 1993, shifted its capital to the medieval town of Bratislava, while the Czech Republic retained Prague. The 2011 split of Sudan turned the county government of Juba into a national capital for South Sudan, without expense or fuss. If countries can accommodate their capitals within existing cities, why do Indian states insist on constructing new ones? After the division with Telangana, try asking a state like Andhra to adopt a small town or village for its administrative needs, and all hell will break loose. Chandigarh as the first, was understandable. Between Nehru and Le Corbusier, the city was not just a capital for Punjab, but an urban symbol for the new India. That the job was awarded to an artist, was part of the risk Nehru took in the hope that the product would be altogether original, and not conform to tried and tested formulas. Since then, Gandhinagar, and New Bhubaneshwar were drawn in the lazy repeat of Western planning models  endless stretches of forlorn buildings bathed in dust, but conceived on paper as English garden cities. The most recent such experiment at Naya Raipur, the new capital for Chhattisgarh, demonstrates outmoded planning ideas at a monumental scale. Built over 8,000 hectares that displaced over 40 villages, the bloated exercise of state expenditure and land grab  despite newer models of land pools  was a shameful criminal act. Sixty years after Chandigarh, shouldn't state governments be constructing models of thrift that demonstrate altogether new forms of governance? Yesterday Naya Raipur, today Amravati. The Andhra government has staked out its planned territorial intent right at the beginning, proposing secretariats, offices, housing and public structures in the most desirable locations. The undemocratic nature of this first stage of design is in sharp  and ironic  contrast to the entirely democratic and uncontrolled free-for-all when the city eventually opens its gates to migrants. Still, the gigantic effort is not without its problems. Besides agitation by angry farmers, missing land records and a site untested for long-term habitation, the cumbersome procedure that involved chief ministers, bureaucrats and foreign architects has quickly descended into farce. Ideals of planning have had to be realigned to suit ancient beliefs of vaastu; the foreigners were entirely unaware that structures in Andhra could not be approached from the north-east; at the insistence of the chief minister, a 'Kuchipudi' bridge will also be built on the river to reflect Andhra culture; the wholly traditional structure would ironically be designed by a Chinese firm. If the ridiculousness of multiple cultural and technical collaborations makes you laugh, the statistics of expense and logistics will make you cry. Twelve million people are expected to move into a city built on 218 square km of land at an expense of one trillion rupees. Because of the physical atrophy of most cities, their state of utter dereliction and despair, the Indian heart lives in perpetual hope that something new and shining, something wholly un-Indian, may still be possible. So the messages are always filled with stock phrases: sustainable eco-conscious design, green concept, mixed-use neighbourhood, people-friendly technology, solar energy, wind farms, smart-city, world class, iconic... How do you even begin to apply this cascade of borrowed and untested pretensions to vague, unmade places? What would it take to get India's new capitals to downsize? Can in fact state governments reconsider their standard call for elaborate structures  of the kind the Mughals and the British built  to places humbler? Sadly, in the seven states that have been added by subtraction into the Union, none has seen the capital as a potential for new ideas. Without an innovative model of the city, handing over large chunks of disputed land to foreign designers is the ultimate sign of hopelessness and despair. The author is a Delhi-based architect</text>

	<text>Andrea Bocelli has always beaten the odds. Despite going blind at age 12 after an accident at a football match, he has emerged as one of the most famous classical crossover tenors in the world. Making his Indian debut on April 20 in Mumbai with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta, the 57-year-old artiste gives Agniva Banerjee a feel for the music You started off in classical music and then branched into pop. There's even a duet with former Pussycat Doll star Nicole Scherzinger later this year in the UK. What would you say you are, a classical or a pop artiste? I have been trained as an opera singer; opera, I feel, is written in my chromosomes. At the same time, I do not deny pop. There are classical music pieces so beautiful they become popular. And vice versa, there are extraordinary pop songs that over time become classics. How old were you when you started singing? I have always been singing. When I was six or seven, I used to listen to the great voices of the time. I knew many opera arias by heart and I sang loudly in my living room, in a sort of competition with my gramophone. When I was a teenager, having been continually asked to sing by my relatives and friends, I started to think that my greatest passion might also become my profession. Do you also play any instruments? I've always shown a certain facility at playing several instruments  from the saxophone to the horn, the accordion to the drums. Of them all, the piano is my most faithful companion, the one which my inner voice turns to without hesitation. What was it like to study under the great tenor Franco Corelli? My nanny gave me one of his records and that marked my destiny. The first time we met was at a masterclass the maestro gave in Turin in north Italy. I remember my hands were cold and my heart was beating wildly. When it was my turn, I sang 'Che gelida manina' (from Puccini's La boheme). I think I sang in a trance! I know for sure I sweated like an Olympic marathon runner in the glowing atmosphere of the room and that I regained consciousness at the end of the piece, when in the general silence of those present, maestro came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder and in a low voice told me, "Indeed you have a beautiful voice." Did you really work as a lawyer for some time? I decided to study law, perhaps following my parents' insistence, because they wanted me to have a professional future. I have always been fascinated by law, as the study of the rules of civil coexistence. I confirm, I worked as a lawyer before I became famous (as a singer). But I never thought about giving up music. Not even when earning a living did it seem an unrealistic dream. You have reportedly sold 80 million albums. What are your views on success? Success is the sum of a series of variables and of inscrutable balances. Fame in itself is not a value, and I am more than convinced that  as I always remind my children  there are a thousand ways to be people of great value without being famous. As for my success, not a day goes by that I do not think, with wonder and gratitude, of the affection I receive from the vast audience I reach, who grant me the great privilege of being part of the soundtrack of their lives. Unusually for an artiste, you hold a pro-life view on abortion. Can you say why? To give a spark of hope to all those women who, for a thousand reasons, are in a situation where they cannot defend the life they are carrying, I decided years ago to share a private memory of my mother's experience. When she was pregnant, doctors advised her an abortion because the baby would be born with severe birth defects. She ignored such advice and with my father's support carried on with the pregnancy. Without that act of courage and faith, today I would not be here to tell you this. Are you excited about visiting Mumbai? I am extremely excited and curious. I have been to many countries, but this will be my first time in India, a great country that has always fascinated me. I have been conquered by its philosophies, I appreciate its ancient architecture, and I am seduced by its rich musical tradition, by the strong spiritual vibration that can be traced in poetry and art. I have been captured by the coexistence between past and future that India expresses.</text>

	<text>Why are New Yorkers more willing to spend twice as much on French food than Indian? Turns out, their attitudes are not so much swayed by spice, but by popular perceptions of a cuisine's ethnicity and associated class, suggests Krishnendu Ray, the chair of the department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University, in his new book The Ethnic Restaurateur. He tells Joeanna Rebello why we're at the near bottom of New York's food chain From political science at DU, to food and nutrition at NYU...when and how did you detour? I came to the US in 1988 to work on questions of development but was waylaid by nostalgia, which expressed itself through food. I realized that I had to cook Indian food if I were to eat it. Which led to the even starker realization that not only did I not know how to cook, but as a good Indian middle class male, I had never given it a thought. That and the inadvertent running into three books, Laura Shapiro's Perfection Salad, Harvey Levenstein's Revolution at the Table and Jack Goody's Cooking, Cuisine and Class made me realize that I had an opportunity to think seriously about what is good to eat. What was going to be new about my work was that most of the writing on food had been done with attention to cultural roots with relatively little on change and how immigration influences our choices. In your comparative price rankings (of 14 popular cuisines reviewed in the Zagat New York restaurant guides in 1986 and 2014), Indian food has fallen from 8 to 9. What does this demotion tell you? I make the argument that culinary prestige has a lot to do with class, race, and nation. Most Indian restaurants in the US, and in New York City, are run by Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and some Indians who are neither very rich, nor fluently Anglophone, nor highly credentialed, which creates the contamination effect for mainstream, middle-class, Americans. Like Mexican or Chinese food, most Americans refuse to pay more than a pittance for Indian food, which cannot buy the skilled labour, the good ingredients or the decor to create an upscale place. Of say the 350 or so Indian restaurants in NYC, only a dozen are upscale. That was the fate of Italian and Greek food too until immigration from the Mediterranean dried to a trickle and there was upward mobility of third-generation Italians and Greeks. Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Soul... are all stuck at the bottom. That will change when the source of immigration of poor people to America changes. I see that happening to new-style Chinese food such as at Jonathan Wu's Fung Tu. Similarly, better credentialed Indian chefs and entrepreneurs like Floyd Cardoz, Hemant Mathur, Surbhi Sahani, Suvir Saran, Sanjeev Kapoor, Jehangir Mehta, among others, are straining to upscale American notions of Indian food. There is an opening there because more than half of Indian immigrants to the US are entering engineering, management, medicine and the academy. So clever interpretations like the restaurant Babu Ji (in NYC) are playing to those possibilities. Can you give us examples of how the improved social status of a country has made its food more coveted? Americans were full of disdain for Japanese culture, especially food, almost into the 1980s when the rise of Japan and contact with Japanese managers completely transformed American posture towards sushi that American elites had both disdained and were unable to appreciate. Why is haute cuisine such a male-dominated world? On every Western top chefs list, it's still mostly men, who rarely do the everyday cooking at home. That is women's work, poor people's work, which is why the modern world of chefs is so masculine, and so white. That is not a coincidence, but constitutive of the process of professionalization of a field. Women and people of colour will eventually break into the field too but not in my lifetime, I think. Food studies is a growing discipline in America and Europe. Why not in India? There is a long tradition of anthropological studies of the food ways of the poor, the rural, the marginal, and the non-literate. What is new with food studies is the attention to urban, literate, non-poor, at the centre of our systems. Sociologist Amita Baviskar is doing fascinating work in that domain  see her work on Maggi and the Indian working class. There are new PhDs being written in Delhi School of Economics  on sweetmeat makers for instance  that is going to open up that part of the field.</text>

	<text>When it comes to drought, India is not alone. The world's underground water reserves are depleting at an alarming rate. Water scientist Jay Famiglietti suggests that countries sitting on top of the world's most stressed aquifers  Turkey, Syria and Iraq (the Arabian aquifer); India and Pakistan (the Indus and the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin); and Libya and Niger (the Murzuk-Djado Basin)  have had political unrest driven in part by food shortages caused by lack of water. The California-based hydrologist speaks to Namita Devidayal on the big water challenge Your research shows that 21 of the world's 37 largest aquifers, which collectively provide water to more than two billion people, have passed 'sustainability tipping points'. How widespread is the water problem? Most of the world's mid-latitude regions  those that are already arid to semi-arid  are getting drier. Unfortunately, most of the 21 depleting aquifers in our study are located in the drying regions, which means that replenishing groundwater supplies will grow even more difficult in the coming decades. Since groundwater fuels agricultural productivity, its disappearance means that producing food for our growing population will become increasing challenging, sooner rather than later. Several states in India are in the grip of drought, especially Maharashtra. What is your analysis of the situation? Our first major study of groundwater depletion was of northwestern India. Using a NASA satellite called GRACE (the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) we found that the Rajasthan-Punjab-Haryana region was losing about 17.7 cubic kilometers per year. Those are among the highest rates of groundwater depletion in the world. They continue to this day, and the region of loss is now spreading across northern India and into Bangladesh. I'm afraid that this does not bode well for India, now and into the future. On a positive note, since the paper was published in 2009 it has catalyzed new efforts in hydrogeological mapping. At World Water Week in Stockholm in 2013, Alok Rawat from the Ministry of Water Resources of India, told participants that the government had recently added approximately 50,000 groundwater monitoring wells and embarked upon its ambitious national aquifer mapping programme towards sustainable water management. What can we do better to intervene? First, human society must appreciate that in many parts of the world, like southern California where I live, and like you are experiencing in northern India, we simply do not have enough water to do all the things that we want to do. Growing food, producing energy, providing water for people and for the environment, all take a heavy toll. Increased awareness of this critical situation is a first step. Conservation and efficiency are the next critical steps  how we use water to grow food and in the home. Regional governance is not always in tune with the world's current understanding of how water moves over and through the Earth. In many places, like in the US for example, water laws and associated rights are centuries- old and no longer make sense. Admittedly, changes in governance will be most difficult to achieve. What can India learn from other countries? We can learn a great deal about technological innovations from countries like Israel, and about policy innovations from countries like Australia. Israel pioneered drip irrigation, it is committed to advanced monitoring of available waters, and it continues to show the rest of the world how to maximize water use efficiency under the most harsh conditions. Australia has been extremely progressive on the policy front. For example, each of its states has a water minister, and there is a national water minister as well. That considerably streamlines the decision-making process. How close is the relationship between climate change and water? The water cycle and climate are intimately linked. Hence, just as we are seeing changes in climate, we are seeing changes to the water cycle and to the availability of fresh water. Both flooding and drought are becoming more extreme. The wet areas of the world are getting wetter and the dry areas drier. We are already seeing the emergence of classes of water 'haves' and 'have nots' that will only lead to social tension in the future. In fact, changes to Earth's water cycle are among the most palpable aspects of climate change.</text>

	<Heading>Designer babies: Where should India draw the line on gene editing?</Heading>

	<text>We need a national conversation before we think about changing the genetic material of our children, writes oncologist and author of 'The Gene', Siddhartha Mukherjee A few years ago, scientists developed powerful technologies to "edit" the genomes of human cells. There are two words in that sentence that deserve explanation  and that matter greatly for India. The "genome" is the entire repository of genetic material that is needed to build, repair and maintain humans. It contains about 3 billion letters of DNA  A,C,T and G  strung together in a rather inscrutable sequence (ACTGGGTTT... and so forth). It might be likened to an encyclopedia of our genetic material  all the genes in all our cells, the additional sequences of DNA that tell our bodies when and where to deploy these genes, and stretches that have no known function. Indeed, if it was printed as an encyclopedia, it would encompass 66 full sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Until recently, "editing" the human genome (or any genome, for that matter) was thought to be impossible  that is, scientists generally agreed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to change the code written into the encyclopedia in an intentional manner. All of this changed in 2012, when a team of biologists discovered a trick by which the human genome can be altered in a rather simple manner. To return to our analogy, this would be like picking one book from the massive library of encyclopedias, changing a single word in that book, and leaving the rest of the code untouched. We still don't know the safety or fidelity of this method  perhaps other words in the code are unintentionally changed  but it is a more powerful method of intervening on the genome than we have encountered in the history of science. This technique has been called "gene editing". What does this mean, and why is it important? On one hand, the capacity to change the human genome in an intentional manner opens up powerful new therapeutic capabilities. Medical scientists can imagine using this technology for gene therapy in human lungs or blood cells  correcting the genetic abnormality that causes sickle cell anaemia, for instance, or other devastating human diseases. But is there also the possibility that these tools will be used to enhance height, or intelligence? What if scientists used these technologies to change the genetic material of human embryos  thereby permanently changing the human gene pool? These questions were raging urgently throughout the scientific world when a disruptive experiment was published. In the spring of 2015, a laboratory in China announced that it had attempted to "edit" the genomes of human embryos. At the Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, a team led by Junjiu Huang obtained 86 human embryos from an IVF clinic and tried to use "gene editing" to correct a gene responsible for a common blood disorder (only embryos that were non-viable in the long term were chosen). Seventy-one embryos survived. Of the 54 embryos tested, only four were found to have the corrected gene inserted. Rage and anguish broke out through the scientific world in response to the experiment in China. In the US, genetic intervention on a human embryo is barricaded through strict laws  and this arena is especially scrutinized as biologists continue to explore gene-editing technologies. Chinese commentators, however, were more sanguine about the use of such technologies. When the prospect of an international moratorium on gene editing in human embryos was suggested, one scientist wrote: "I don't think China wants to take a moratorium." A Chinese bioethicist clarified, "Confucian thinking says someone becomes a person after they are born. That is different from the US and other countries with a Christian influence, where because of religion they may feel research on embryos is not okay". Where might India fit in this bioethical spectrum? At least this much is clear: a response is necessary, because the tools to modify human embryos are becoming simpler, more accurate, and widely available around the world. With burgeoning biotechnological capabilities, scientists in India could potentially perform experiments similar to the ones performed in China, or other experiments that might lead to gene editing in human embryos. In 2001, as described in the British Medical Journal, a national bioethics panel in India "said that scientists may harvest human embryos for research before day 14 of gestation with the informed consent of the donor. All projects would have to be approved by the national bioethics panel, and researchers would have to share any commercial benefits that emerge from embryonic stem cell lines with the donor." The Indian Council for Medical Research, and other bioethics panels in the country are performing an admirable task of re-evaluating these guidelines in the light of new gene editing technologies. But this needs to be a national and public conversation. What moral precepts should guide us as we think about changing the genetic material of our children? Where does our culture, or history, force us to draw strong lines? The context is especially important, because the desire for genetic intervention exists in this country. In parts of India, crude technologies of genetic diagnosis through amniocentesis (and other methods) have reportedly resulted in the selective abortion of female foetuses. The impact of genetic diagnosis remains unclear, but the overall skew in the gender ratio in parts of India is striking: about 850 females to every 1,000 males in Punjab and Haryana. The shift towards male children in these states may underscore a more general aspiration to use interventions  genetic or otherwise  to produce more "desirable" children. Should the bioethics panels require the consensus of such citizens in drafting a policy on genetic intervention on human embryos? These questions will only be amplified in intensity as we move towards the future. For now, as we consider the wider implications of gene editing in India, it might be advisable to use three guiding principles for the future. l First, genetic interventions should only be used to alleviate extraordinary suffering  that is, their role should be restricted to diseases that devastate human beings. l Second: these interventions should be used on genes that are clearly implicated in diseases, and not genes where the link to the illness is weak or speculative (and certainly not used to tamper with genes that purportedly influence height or intelligence, about which we know very little). l And third, and most important: the interventions should not be carried out without state mandate or state supervision. These principles might be imagined as a "safe triangle" within which genetic interventions on humans may still be performed  while the Indian public considers future policies in this arena. Until a time that a consensus is reached, Indian scientists might also wish to join the proposed international moratorium on gene editing on human embryos. BLURB: The desire for genetic intervention exists in India. In some parts, crude technologies of genetic diagnosis have resulted in selective abortion of female foetuses. The shift towards male children may underscore a more general aspiration to use interventions to produce more 'desirable' children.</text>

	<text>We talk of 'aspirational India', but how easy is it today for a talented young Indian to overcome material disadvantage? Anirudh Krishna, professor of public policy at Duke University and currently visiting fellow at JNU, shares insights from his research on social mobility with Amulya Gopalakrishnan What are the chances of young Indians from disadvantaged backgrounds making it to the new economic opportunities available today? People who are better prepared in India, who have higher college degrees from well-known institutions, have climbed very high. But several others have not had the same opportunities. Research shows that people educated in rural areas rarely make it into higher-paying professions. Similarly, those who are not educated in English-medium schools (more than 80% of all students) and those whose parents have less than a high-school education (more than 90%) continue to experience severe disadvantages, as do SCs and STs, especially if they are also poor and also rural. They are more than 60% of the population, but people educated in rural schools constitute less than 3% of the intake of business schools and engineering colleges. A vicious cycle operates for people who grow up in poorer and more remote communities. Where no one has climbed high in the past, no one knows for sure which pathways lead upward. There are many smart, hardworking kids in poorer communities. They lack role models. They lack access to career information: what good jobs (or other ways of making a decent living) exist out there? What does it take to get into one of these occupations? How do I measure up against the competition? The education they get is often of poor quality. They get no support of a confidence-building nature. That's not just a problem for the individuals concerned. Low individual achievements across a broad front lead to overall poor national performance. India consistently wins the lowest number of Olympic medals per thousand population. On other measures too  patents applied for, new businesses registered, research papers published  India does poorly in relation to its vast human potential. What kind of groups have improved their prospects over the last three decades? The most heartening trend has been the rise of education. For instance, in Rajasthan and Karnataka, two states where I studied intergenerational differences, no more than 15% of rural grandparents have five or more years of education. But 70% of those aged 11-20 years have at least this level of education. And these numbers keep rising. Another heartening change has been the increased representation of women in higher-paying professions. In the 1960s, there were almost no women in elite engineering or management institutions. But 20% of the recent intake into top-tier B-schools, and 40% in top-tier engineering colleges, is women. It's still not 50%, but it's headed in that direction. Another group that has improved its position consists of youth from smaller towns and district capitals. A greater proportion of these individuals, compared to 20 years ago, have been making it into higher-paying positions. How effectively has education propelled people ahead? The threshold level after which education makes a big difference has risen considerably in recent years. On account of tech advancements, an ever-higher level of education is required. At least a high-school diploma, and more usually a college degree, are necessary in order to gain a big jump in earnings. But few people still have this level of education. Only 15% of rural individuals in the 18-24 age group were attending educational institutions in 2008; even fewer among poorer households and remoter areas. To cater to the rising demand, colleges of indifferent quality have proliferated. Many families that have bet their shirts on education will be disappointed to find that this education has only rendered their child "unemployable." There's a great deal of frustration building up. To what extent does migrating to cities help? Families who can afford these costs have moved their children to towns, where they attend better schools and become part of an environment where talking about jobs and careers is common. These children, with richer parents, have progressed. Others, including child labourers, haven't. Migrating to cities has proven to be a layered experience. How can social policy be rebooted to encourage mobility. Could you suggest three steps? * Improve the quality of education in public schools by giving teachers more autonomy and parents more oversight. * Invest in a programme for superior role model development: over the next years, help build up at least one high-performing individual from every village and every poorer urban community. * Attitudes and beliefs often limit the prospects of people who are thought by others to be "lower" (and thus less deserving of a brighter future). It is not often mentioned in policy reform discussions, but changing attitudes is critically important.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Mugly, who was crowned as the World's Ugliest Dog in 2012, has won the Hero award here for serving as a therapy dog and helping adults and children with disabilities. Mugly, a 12-year-old Chinese Crested dog, has been working as voluntary therapy pet for the past six years, participating in reading programmes for children and visiting adults with physical disabilities and learning challenges as part of a British organisation, Therapy Dogs Nationwide. He won an award for 'Most Heroic Hound' at the SuperDogs awards at the National Pet Show in London last week, the Daily Express reported. Mugly was abandoned by a breeder when he was just three-days-old. Then, he grew into a very ugly dog - so ugly that a panel of judges in the US crowned him the World's Ugliest Dog in 2012 and Britain's ugliest dog in 2005. Besides regularly visiting schools as part of the Read to Dogs scheme - an initiative that encourages nervous readers to speak out loud to boost their confidence - he is also involved in a project that lets children feel comfortable with animals. In addition, he works with adults who have learning disorders and disabilities. He's been a certified therapy dog since 2010. "He amazes me with his ability to know exactly how to be when he meets people. With a blind person, he stands completely still and lets them explore him; or when someone is upset, he pushes his body into them for comfort." said his owner Bev Nicholson. According to the American Kennel Club, Chinese crested dog is "a toy dog, fine-boned, elegant and graceful. The distinct varieties are born in the same litter. The Hairless with hair only on the head, tail and feet and the Powderpuff, completely covered with hair. The breed serves as a loving companion, playful and entertaining. "He is a bit like Marmite, some people love him and other people don't. Older people want a big fluffy dog to hug, not Mugly," Nicholson said. He's been on multiple TV shows, including Mutt Ugly (Ch5) Ronnie's Animal Crackers (BBC1) and A Different Breed (Sky1).</text>

	<text>A woman who said she wanted to marry the terrorist known as "Jihadi John" has been jailed for four and a half years for spreading Isis propaganda. Zafreen Khadam was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court after being found guilty of 10 terror offences. The North East Counter Terrorism Unit (NECTU) said the 32-year-old had openly supported Isis and had told friends she wanted to marry Mohammed Emwazi, the British militant labeled Jihadi John after he appered in several videos beheading Western hostages. The head of NECTU, Detective Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, said his officers had reviewed hundreds of hours of video and thousands of social media posts where Khadam openly expressed her admiration for Isis's extremist ideology and said she was planning to go to Syria. He said: "It is clear from the evidence presented that Khadam openly demonstrated support for Daesh [Isis] and their ideology, using multiple social media accounts to further spread the propaganda of this terrorist organisation. "Khadam has not disputed posting the information, claiming she did so out of curiosity and the belief that she did not consider it to be terrorist material. Yet this material glorified terrorism and delivered powerful messages, encouraging terrorist acts and calling upon others to kill." He added: "Khadam was prolific in her use of social media and showed little regard for the consequences of openly sharing deeply disturbing images and material across a number of digital platforms. Much of this material encouraged violent action and was very extreme in the violence it portrayed." He said they had received an anonymous tip off that Khadam had been using 15 social media profiles for posting extreme material. One of her accounts, using the Twitter handle Jihadi Princess, favourited videos including ones that depicted prisoners kneeling in cages preparing for execution and which went on to show one person being burnt alive in a cage and another having his throat cut. Another portrayed the use of children by Isis, including weapons training and youngsters threatening to kill non-Muslims. NECTU said analysis of Khadam's activity on WhatsApp showed she sent a number of Isis-produced videos and documents to numerous contacts. One video by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdad which justified terrorism was sent as a data link, advising contacts to watch it before it was taken down. Another video was of the murder of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death. Mr Wain said his team feared that if Khadam had not been arrested she might have attempted to travel to Syria. He said: "The reach and influence of social media is vast. Daesh and other groups are increasingly using the internet to encourage support for their objectives and to provoke individuals to carry out attacks in the UK. Therefore, tackling extremist material is important to protect the public and prevent offences that incite or encourage acts of terrorism. "Today's verdict, I hope, sends out a strong message that actions such as those carried out by Khadam will not be tolerated and ourselves, together with policing colleagues and other partner agencies, will bring those who are breaking the law to justice. "It is also important to reiterate that our priority is the safety of our communities. We will bring those who have committed a criminal offence before the courts, however we would much prefer to stop people from crossing into a path of criminality."</text>

	<text>LONDON: South Korean author Han Kang won the Man Booker International Prize on Monday, sharing the 50,000 ($72,000, 63,500 euros) award with her translator  who had only taught herself Korean three years before. Han Kang, 45, an author and creative writing teacher who is already successful in South Korea, is likely to enjoy a spike in international sales following the win for "The Vegetarian". "I'm so honoured" she told AFP. "The work features a protagonist who wants to become a plant, and to leave the human race to save herself from the dark side human nature. "Through this extreme narrative I felt I could question... the difficult question of being human." She was the first South Korean to win the prize. Described as "lyrical and lacerating" by chairman of the judges Boyd Tonkin, the tale traces the story of an ordinary woman's rejection of convention from three different perspectives. It was picked unanimously by the panel of five judges, beating six other novels including "The Story of the Lost Child" by Italian sensation Elena Ferrante and "A Strangeness in My Mind" by Turkey's Orhan Pamuk. "This is a book of tenderness and terror," Boyd told guests at the award ceremony dinner at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Han Kang's first book to appear in English, "The Vegetarian" was described by newspaper The Guardian as a shock to the system. "Across the three parts, we are pressed up against a society's most inflexible structures  expectations of behaviour, the workings of institutions  and we watch them fail one by one," Daniel Hahn wrote in a review. For the first time this year, the award went jointly to the translator, Deborah Smith, 28, who only started learning Korean three years before she embarked on the translation. "This was the first book that I ever translated, and the best possible thing that can happen to a translator has just happened to me," an emotional Smith told AFP. "When I was 22 I decided to teach myself Korean... I felt that I was limited by only being able to speak English. I'd always read a lot of translations, and you get the sense of this whole world being out there, very different perspectives, different stories," she said. "It felt as thought I looked up almost every other word in the dictionary. It felt a bit like climbing a mountain. But at the same time just falling into this world that was so atmospheric and disturbing and moving  it was a wonderful experience." The international edition of Britain's Man Booker Prize was introduced in 2005 and up to now has been awarded in recognition of a body of work by a living author whose work was written or available in English. But from this year, it will be presented annually for a single work of fiction that has been translated into English and published in Britain. Once the poor relation in the English-language literary world, translations are becoming increasingly popular. New research by Nielsen for the prize organisers revealed physical book sales of translated fiction in Britain rose 96 per cent between 2001 and 2016, despite the market as a whole falling over that period. Translated fiction is still a very small genre, representing just 1.5 per cent of fiction and 3.5 per cent of literary fiction, but it provided five per cent of fiction sales and seven per cent of literary fiction sales last year. Growth in translated Korean fiction in Britain was particularly strong.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A married lesbian couple from India has lost their legal battle to stay in the UK on the grounds that their relationship would not be legally recognised in India. The couple, who cannot be named for legal reasons, arrived from India as friends in 2007 and went on to enter into a civil partnership in Scotland in 2008, which they converted into marriage last year. Judges at the UK's court of appeal rejected their application to remain in the UK on the grounds that their relationship would not be legally recognised in their home country of India. According to the 'Guardian', they both completed Master's degrees in Scotland and then found work and have always lived on legal visas in the UK and now want to acquire an "Indefinite Leave to Remain" in the country. The Court of Appeal, however, analysed background material on India and accepted that India provided no legal protection or recognition of same-sex couples but felt their return to India would not be a violation of their right to a family life as there was no evidence the couple would suffer violence on return. "My family do not know that I am a lesbian or that I am married. If I return home they will treat me as a single woman and start looking for a suitable husband for me," one of the women who cannot be identified was quoted as saying by the report. "I won't have any legal protection for who I am because my marriage will not be recognised in India. In India we will both have to hide who we are. In the UK we enjoy our family life together," she said. The couple's barrister, S Chelvan, said: "This is a landmark judgment, as it is the first case from the Court of Appeal to address the balancing of the rights of migrant same-sex couples to legal recognition and protection, with immigration control and economic interests of the UK." The couple are now planning to appeal against the decision to the UK's Supreme Court.</text>

	<text>LONDON: The BBC should give more airtime to Hindu, Sikh and Muslim religious programmes and diversify its programmming to balance out its "too Christian" output, an internal review by its own ethics committee has recommended. Aaqil Ahmed, BBC head of religion and ethics, has recommended in the report that the British public service broadcaster must diversify its religious programmes. "Christianity remains the cornerstone of our output and there are more hours dedicated to it than there are to other faiths," Ahmed said in a statement. "Our output in this area is not static, though. It has evolved over the years and we regularly assess it," he added. The report recommended upping the number of programmes for Muslim, Sikh and Hindu audiences, saying that non-Christian faiths were under-represented in the broadcaster's output. BBC director-general Tony Hall is considering the review's findings, which said the broadcaster's current output was "too Christian" and recommend more Hindu, Sikh and Muslim religious programmes be added to the mix, The Sunday Times reported. The debate follows a government white paper last week on the BBC, which will require it to serve ethnic minorities better. A BBC spokesperson said, "we are actually intending to do more programming around Christianity and more on other faiths as well, so there is absolutely no question of an 'either or' on our output." The Church of England said faith - and Christianity - was growing worldwide and "any comprehensive review needs to move beyond arguments of mere proportionality to embrace the need not only for greater religious literacy but also increased resources to explore religious world views." BBC's religious output currently includes 'Songs of Praise' and 'Sunday Morning Live' on television, plus 'Thought for the Day' and 'Act of Worship' on radio. The Muslim Council of Britain suggests televising Friday prayers from a mosque would be one way to better serve Muslim viewers, but not at the cost of Christian programmes.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A tip from a CIA spy to authorities in apartheid-era South Africa led to Nelson Mandela's 1962 arrest, beginning the leader's 27 years behind bars, an article in the Sunday Times reported. The newspaper cited comments reportedly made by Donald Rickard, a former US vice-consul in Durban and CIA operative, to British film director John Irvin. Irvin's new film " Mandela's Gun ", about the months before the anti-apartheid icon's arrest, is due to be screened at the Cannes film festival this week. Mandela was eventually freed from prison in 1990 and went on to become South Africa's president between 1994 and 1999 before dying in 2013 aged 95. An article by James Sanders, who said he was asked by Irvin to investigate the issue, said the director travelled to the US earlier in 2016 and interviewed Rickard. Rickard explained how Mandela was arrested as he travelled between Durban and Johannesburg but did not explain how he had learnt where he would be. "I found out when he was coming down and how he was coming... that's where I was involved and that's where Mandela was caught," Rickard was quoted as saying. He added that Mandela was "completely under the control of the Soviet Union". "He could have incited a war in South Africa, the United States would have to get involved, grudgingly, and things could have gone to hell," Rickard added. "We were teetering on the brink here and it had to be stopped, which meant Mandela had to be stopped. And I put a stop to it." Zizi Kodwa, national spokesman of Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, called the revelation "a serious indictment" but said it was nothing new. "We always knew there was always collaboration between some Western countries and the apartheid regime," he told AFP. He claimed that though the incident happened decades ago, the CIA was still interfering in South African politics. "We have recently observed that there are efforts to undermine the democratically elected ANC government," he alleged. "They never stopped operating here." "It is still happening now -- the CIA is still collaborating with those who want regime change." Rickard, who was reportedly employed by the CIA until 1978, died in March, two weeks after talking to Irvin.</text>

	<text>LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron warned that Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists would be happy if Britain was to vote to leave the European Union (EU) in the crucial June 23 referendum. Cameron, who was addressing a World Economic Forum event here, highlighted on the negative impact of Brexit, which would be welcomed only by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of ISIS. "Who would be happy if we left? Putin might be happy. I suspect al-Bagdadi might be happy," he said. His latest comments, alluding to making the UK more vulnerable to terrorists in the event of an EU exit, will be described as scaremongering by the Leave camp, which says Brexit would give the UK greater control over its borders. The Cameron-led Remain campaign maintains that the UK already has the power to check all passports, with a pan- European security network providing additional security. Cameron also vowed that the referendum will be a "once in a lifetime" event, rubbishing statements by some Leave campaigners raising the prospect of another referendum in the future. "I'm absolutely clear that the referendum is the referendum. It is a once in a generation, once in a lifetime opportunity. The result determines the outcome - if we vote to stay, we stay, and that's it. If we vote to leave, we leave, and that's it. We can't have 'never-endums'," he said. He was responding to comments made by UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage that there could be strong demand for a re-run of the EU referendum if the Remain camp wins by a narrow margin on June 23. "In a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way. If the Remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it," he said. The opinion polls are running neck-and-neck currently, with both camps at a nearly 50-50 vote. The campaigning by both side will intensify in the coming weeks in an attempt to swing any undecided votes.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: JK Rowling, who once called Donald Trump worse than her fictional Harry Potter villain Voldemort, has said that the controversial real estate mogul has her support to visit the UK and "be offensive and bigoted there." "Only last year, we saw an online petition to ban Donald Trump from entry in the UK. It garnered half a million signatures," she said at Pen America's annual literary gala here. "Now, I find almost everything that Mr. Trump says objectionable. I consider him offensive and bigoted. But he has my full support to come to my country and be offensive and bigoted there," she said. Rowling, who became famous for creating the iconic Harry Potter book series, was referring to the UK petition with more than 568,000 signatures to ban Trump from visiting. As a result of the petition, the British parliament held a debate but no vote in January, with lawmakers using the discussion to air their views on Trump under the protection of parliamentary privilege, which legally shields members from accusations of defamation or slander. Rowling, 50, who accepted an award at the Pen gala for her humanitarian work, said the freedom that protects Trump's right to speak his mind also protects her right to "call him a bigot." "If you seek the removal of freedoms from an opponent simply on the grounds that they have offended you, you have crossed a line to stand alongside tyrants who imprison, torture and kill on exactly the same justifications," Rowling said in her speech. Last December, after Trump stood by his proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims from entering the US, Rowling tweeted, "How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad."</text>

	<text>LONDON: An armed US air marshal was removed from a packed Los Angeles-bound plane at Heathrow airport after the captain found that he "stank of booze". Metropolitan police officers were called to the plane at Terminal 2 after the United Airlines captain claimed the marshal "stank of booze". A police spokesman said the man was breathalysed and arrested last Monday, but released from custody a short time later with no further action. The marshal -- carrying a concealed loaded weapon -- was taken to the airport's nick and breathalysed. He was reportedly one of the four air marshals on board the transatlantic flight. The flight to Los Angeles was two hours late taking off. A source on the Boeing 777 said on Saturday after up to 266 passengers aboard Flight 935 were left fuming: "The captain smelt alcohol on the breath of one of four armed US air marshals who were on board. "It caused quite a scene," The Sun quoted the source as saying. The federal marshal -- whose duty in the wake of 9/11 is to "detect, deter and defeat hostile acts" -- was later freed without charge because he had not broken any UK laws. A police source said: "It is only an offence if someone has an aviation function like flying the plane or being an engineer. "When the case was reviewed it was decided the legislation did not fit with the function he performed," the police source said.</text>

	<text>LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron said he would be happy to meet Donald Trump if he becomes the Republican presidential candidate. But the British leader repeated his claim that Trump's proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States is "wrong and divisive" and "a very dangerous thing to say". Asked on the 'Peston on Sunday' show if he'd meet Trump, Cameron responded, "I don't know". He added, "American presidential candidates have made a habit of coming through Europe and through the U.K., and if that happens I'd be very happy to." Trump had said last week that he was "not going to have a very good relationship" with Cameron, though he later backtracked and even said the prime minister had invited him to visit 10 Downing Street.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Queen Elizabeth II today unveiled UK government's agenda for the year, announcing plans for new counter-extremism legislation, measures to tackle corruption, money laundering and tax evasion. The 90-year-old Queen made her 63rd speech to mark the State Opening of the British Parliament at the Palace of Westminster in London, nearly a month ahead of the crucial referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU. The Queen's Speech, which sets the UK government's agenda for the year, included 21 bills on issues ranging from a crackdown on extremist preachers in Britain, charging foreigners for use of the National Health Service (NHS), a major shake-up of the prisons system, support for a spaceport and driverless cars. "Legislation will be introduced to prevent radicalisation, tackle extremism in all its forms, and promote community integration," she said in her speech addressed to both Houses of Parliament and delivered from her throne in the House of Lords. The government will push ahead with controversial plans to monitor Internet use through its Investigatory Powers Bill and crack down on extremism, including stronger powers to disrupt radicals' activities and to intervene in unregulated schools which are "teaching hate". Plans were also announced to fight international corruption. David Cameron's government plans to criminalise corporations who fail to stop staff facilitating tax evasion, while there will also be new rules tightening up Britain's anti-money laundering regime. The Queen made only the briefest of direct references to her government holding "a referendum on membership of the European Union". But - in a move that may be seen as an attempt to reassure voters ahead of the EU referendum - she added: "My ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons." On the National Health Service, the Queen said, "My government will continue work to deliver NHS services over seven days of the week in England. Legislation will be introduced to ensure that overseas visitors pay for the health treatment they receive at public expense." The Queen used the lift to get to her throne for the first time this year, seen as the first public concession to her age yet. She is believed to have avoided the 26 steps of the Sovereign's Entrance staircase due to trouble with her knees. As part of prison reforms, described as the centrepiece of this year's Queen's Speech, satellite-tagged inmates could be sent home on weekdays. The tracking tags, which monitor the movements of offenders using GPS technology, will be piloted in eight police areas from September, in a move which could see prisoners become weekend inmates and spend the rest of the week at home and being able to take up a job. In a statement released as the Queen delivered her address, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: "Because this government sees the potential in everyone, we finally undertake the long-overdue change that our prisons need. "No longer will they be warehouses for criminals, we want them to be incubators of changed and reformed lives."</text>

	<text>LONDON: A BBC plan to shut down its recipe website left Britons simmering on Tuesday at the demise of a resource offering free tips on cooking everything from lemon drizzle cake to scrambled egg. The move was announced as part of a push to save 150 million (190 million euros, $220 million) after Prime Minister David Cameron's government told the national broadcaster to slim down. Nearly 70,000 people and rising have signed a petition opposing the closure and calling the 11,000 recipes, some from celebrity chefs like Nigella Lawson, "much loved" and "precious". Thousands also took to Twitter to protest. "Can't imagine there is ANYONE in the UK who cooks who won't be upset," wrote user Olivia Crellin. "Literally 90% of my dinners are from #bbcrecipes," added Aniqah C. A BBC spokeswoman insisted that while the website was being closed and no further recipes would be added, people would still be able to access existing ones. But media reports suggested the recipes could become hard to find. The broadcaster said in a statement that its online activities would now focus on "six flagship areas after a review to ensure they remain high quality and distinctive". These include news, sport and "ideas - arts, culture, history and science. Other sites being closed include travel and some local news pages. The deputy leader of the main opposition Labour party, Tom Watson, condemned the announcement. He said the site was being closed because ministers thought the recipes represented "mission creep - the BBC producing content in areas which should be left to commercial rivals. "They want the markets to decide how you choose and pay for your recipes," Watson added. "Yet no market could offer access to so many recipes, free at the point of use because they can't recreate the licence fee model." The BBC is largely funded by the annual licence fee of 145.50 which every household watching live television has to pay. Last week, culture secretary John Whittingdale published a long-awaited policy paper on the future of the BBC. It indicated that online content should focus on "rigorous, impartial analysis of important news events and current affairs". The 150 million cuts confirmed Tuesday come as part of 700 million in overall savings which the BBC must make by 2021/22. The broadcaster has announced hundreds of job cuts in recent months.</text>

	<text>LONDON: University tuition fees are set to soar above the current 9,000-a-year limit under plans for higher education reforms that came out on Monday. Top-performing institutions will be allowed to charge more every year in line with inflation, with no upper limit. The shake-up also includes rules for publishing data on student contact time and jobs won upon graduation to stamp out "Mickey Mouse" courses. Tech firms like Facebook and Google will be allowed to set up "challenger institutions" to provide degrees tailored to the kind of staff they want. Critics warned rises in fees would add to student debt. Sorana Vieru of the National Union of Students said they would "understandably be outraged". She was also concerned about the "challenger" universities proposed by the Department of Business, which could prove "short-lived". Vieru said, "Students could end up in institutions that end up folding because they are a business enterprise." On the other hand, universities minister Jo Johnson said they would boost teaching quality. The White Paper, called Success as a Knowledge Economy, also proposes forcing all universities to reveal the gender, background and ethnicity of their student intake. Ministers said this will "shine a spotlight" on which institutions are failing to recruit from working class or black and minority ethnic backgrounds. 'The Mickey Mouse Trap' "Mickey Mouse" degrees refer to those degrees that are worthless or irrelevant. There were some 400 lightweight "Mickey Mouse" degrees across 91 sites in the UK at one point, a study claims. Researchers said the subject matter in each case was "intellectually threadbare and inferior to on-the-job training". The Tax Payers' Alliance singled out "Outdoor adventure with philosophy" at Marjon College in Plymouth. It featured "creative outdoor study and spirituality". (Daily Mirror)</text>

	<text>SENDAI: Britain's possible exit from the European Union took centre stage at a G7 meeting in Japan on Saturday, as UK finance minister George Osborne warned a 'Brexit' could doom trade deals with EU countries. The comments came during two days of talks largely focused on how the club of rich nations can stoke the lumbering world economy, with terrorism financing and a sharp divide over currency policy also on the table. As the vote on Britain's future in the EU draws closer, Osborne said his meetings with G7 counterparts underscored the gravity of the in-out decision next month. "If Britain left the EU, and wanted access to the single market... then we would need to pay into the EU budget and we'd have to accept free movement of people but we'd have no say over those policies at all," Osborne told the BBC. Britain will decide in a referendum on June 23 whether to stay in the EU or leave the 28-country bloc. Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne, like Prime Minister David Cameron, is campaigning for Britain to stay in. "If we left the EU we would have a two year period to negotiate our exit with 27 other countries, we'd then have to negotiate new arrangements... and at the same time conclude over 50 trade deals with countries that aren't even in Europe," he said. "That would be extremely difficult to do." During that period, businesses would have "no certainty" about the future and so would not take on new workers or invest, he said. "It hits people's incomes, it hits the value of houses, it hits businesses and jobs. People are beginning to understand that," said Osborne. European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, attending the meetings at a famous hot spring resort in northern Japan, said the G7 - which also includes the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - backed Britain remaining in the EU. "It is obvious that all the partners around the table want Great Britain to stay inside the EU and we are all aware that the situation would be bad, it would be a loss" if it left, Moscovici said. "We have no 'plan B'. When you start having a 'plan B' it means that you don't believe in your plan A. There is just one plan: the United Kingdom inside a united Europe." With just over a month to the vote, the "Remain" camp is on 55 per cent and the "Leave" campaign on 45 per cent, according to the What UK Thinks website's average of the last six opinion polls.</text>

	<text>HARTFORD: A Connecticut man, who was a player in the notorious French Connection heroin ring of the 1960s and 1970s, according to the federal authorities, is set to be sentenced to at least five years in prison in a new drug case. Alfred Catino, 75, of Danbury, was among 16 people busted in Connecticut in 2012 for distributing marijuana, cocaine and oxycodone in Fairfield County. He pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy charge in 2014. He's scheduled to be sentenced Monday in federal court in New Haven. Catino's lawyer, Frank Riccio II, is asking the judge to impose the mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence, while prosecutors are seeking a 10-year prison sentence. Catino's criminal record is a colorful history of drug dealing and prison sentences dating to the 1960s, when federal authorities say he was part of the French Connection heroin smuggling ring that spawned the 1971 Oscar-winning movie of the same name starring Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider. The French Connection was the major supplier of heroin to the United States, sending in hundreds of millions of dollars' worth for years until police busted it up in the early 1970s. Federal authorities say it involved Turkish heroin refined in Marseille, France, and smuggled into the US. A big bust in the case in 1962 by New York City detectives was the subject of the movie. Law enforcement officials say they had no idea about Catino's history when they arrested him in the latest drug case, and were surprised when they found out. Riccio has said Catino doesn't deny being part of the French Connection. Catino pleaded guilty in June to conspiring to sell controlled substances, admitting he was part of a group involved in a failed effort to distribute about 200 pounds of marijuana from California to Connecticut and sell cocaine and oxycodone. All of the other defendants also pleaded guilty. The bust was the result of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Connecticut State Police and local officers that included court-ordered wiretaps on the cellphones of Catino and others.</text>

	<text>LONDON: London's new mayor Sadiq Khan has invited US presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to visit the UK and meet his family in a bid to end their ongoing feud about his plan to ban all Muslims from America. Khan said the presumptive Republican nominee should come to the UK to meet his wife Saadiya along with his daughters Anisah and Ammarah. He told UK television channel ITV: "On your programme I invite Donald Trump to come to London. Meet my wife and my daughters. Meet my friends and my neighbours." "Meet Londoners who are British, they're Londoners, they're Muslim," he said. Khan's comments are the latest in an ongoing feud with Trump. On Monday Trump called Khan "very rude" in an interview and challenged him to an IQ test. Khan said: "You know the great thing about London? Muslim, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, we don't just tolerate each other, we respect, we celebrate, we embrace." "And my concern is this. Are you inadvertently making our countries less safe by giving the impression there is a clash of civilisations? Are you doing the job of Daesh (Islamic State) and the extremists for them by saying the West hates Islam? I am the West," he said.</text>

	<text>He has shot to fame as London's first 'Muslim' mayor. And the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, a Hindu shrine, is among Saqid Khans's favourite places in the city. In a recent Facebook post, Khan has expressed his fondness for the temple. Pictures of Khan visiting the temple days before being elected as the mayor have gone viral where Khan is seen interacting with people from other faiths at the temple. He even holds out his hand for a priest to tie a string around his wrist, in keeping with a Hindu custom. Khan has declared his intentions to stand up for the London's Indian community and further strengthen the city's friendship with India. He called himself the 'most pro-business' London mayor ever, and expressed interest in leading a trade delegation to India. He also vowed to challenge the present government's 'unfair visa restrictions' that often make it difficult for businesses to find the best skilled employees.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A London temporary worker, sent home for wearing flat shoes, has collected more than 120,000 signatures so far in a petition calling for Britain to make it illegal for a firm to require women to wear high heels at work. Reaching that total on Friday easily put Nicola Thorp's petition over the 100,000-signature threshold needed to have Britain's parliament consider holding a debate on an issue. Thorp made headlines this week when she launched her campaign describing how she had arrived in flat shoes for her first day to work as a receptionist for accounting company PwC last December to be told she had to wear heels. She told British media she refused an offer to go buy a pair of heels and was sent home without pay. Portico, the agency through which Thorp got the job, had set the uniform guidelines and has since reviewed and revised its policy upon PwC's request. It now says "all our female colleagues can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer". Thorp started the government petition this week, saying "current formal work dress codes are out-dated and sexist". "Employers are allowed to impose different dress codes for men and women, which is fair enough as long as that dress code doesn't favour one of the sexes," Thorp told Britain's ITN television. "By making women wear high heels you are acting favourably towards men because their footwear doesn't affect their posture, their ability to move. It doesn't create long term health problems."</text>

	<text>LONDON: Does one person really need 900 horses to tell their life story? Well, maybe if they're 90 years old, have ruled over Britain for decades and really love horses. For Queen Elizabeth II, it's not just a birthday, it's a birthday season. And the four-day, 900-horse, 1,500-human extravaganza that begins Thursday is a spectacle marking the midpoint, halfway between her real birthday in April and her official birthday, to be celebrated nationally in early June. The festival will climax on Sunday evening with a national televised show to be attended by the queen and her husband Prince Philip. It is taking place at the same time as the Royal Windsor Horse Show, on part of the estate that includes Windsor Castle, one of the queen's favorite retreats. This festival is designed with the queen's passions in mind. There's no doubt the queen is dutiful, fulfilling thousands of official obligations since 1952, but little doubt that being around horses is what she really enjoys. Even on official foreign trips, she often schedules a free morning or afternoon to check out equine culture in the countries she's visiting, sometimes confounding schedulers by tarrying too long. Thus the organizers have decreed: Let there be horses aplenty. And let there be singers and theater acts and dancers as well. The evening performances promise to be eclectic in the extreme and possibly a bit kitschy: Dancers and singers will be coming from all parts of the globe, including Oman, Chile, New Zealand, Canada and Azerbaijan. Military bands and 100 pipers will get their time onstage as well. Organizers have built on the success of a similar pageant held four years ago to mark the queen's Diamond Jubilee, but that was small beer- only 556 horses. This time, they've upped the number to 900, 10 for each of the queen's years. Viewers who watch from home are likely to see something quite rare. It's almost guaranteed that the often stern monarch, known for keeping her emotions in check, will smile once or twice at the feats of horsemanship on display.</text>

The second shows her gently gazing at a bird perched on her arm. The release is part of a four-day pageant this weekend that will salute her long reign. The extravaganza coincides with the Royal Windsor Horse Show, on part of the estate that includes Windsor Castle.

	<text>Chennai: Having secured just 2.4% votes in the assembly election, DMDK will lose its state party status along with its 'drum' symbol. But, even party leader and actor Vijayakant donned the grease-paint and got busy with shooting for his upcoming film 'Tamizhan Endru Sol' with his son, Shanmuga Pandian, his alliance partners called on Vijayakanth, apparently to persuade him to continue with the alliance for the civic polls as well, just six months away. Election Commission rules demand that a recognized party secure not less than 6% of the total valid votes polled in the assembly election. Having contested in 104 seats as part of a six-party alliance including People's Welfare Front and G K Vasan's TMC, Vijayakanth's DMDK managed to secure only 10.34 lakh votes, out of 4.28 crore votes polled in the state. "An order (de-recognizing the party) will be issued by the commission," chief electoral officer Rajesh Lakhoni told TOI. The party drew a blank in the polls, and Vijayakant himself lost the election deposit. He lost in the Ulundurpet constituency by 34,000 votes. De-recognition of his party would also mean that it would lose its reserved symbol 'Murasu' (drum). On Friday, Vijayakant tweeted that he would be shooting for the Tamil film with his son. A picture along with the tweet showed him sitting on a swing and reading a book. During a talk with PWF leaders at his Koyambedu office on Saturday, the actor is said to have expressed his intention to continue in the front to take up people's issues. MDMK leader Vaiko, VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan, CPI's R Mutharasan and TMC leader G K Vasan were present at the meeting. "It was a cordial meeting where Vijayakanth reiterated his commitment to jointly work with us to strive for people's welfare," said Thirumavalavan. Vijayakanth is also said to have expressed his unhappiness over Vaiko backing out of the polls, citing caste-tension. DMDK functionaries, however, are a worried lot. While a section had rebelled against the party's decision to align with the PWF before the assembly election, a majority too had disagreed with the leadership's decision though they chose to remain with Vijayakant.</text>

	<text>Chennai: DMK on Saturday nominated former Lok Sabha MP T K S Elangovan and party headquarters secretary R S Bharathi to stand for to the Rajya Sabha election where six seats from Tamil Nadu are becoming vacant. The election is scheduled for June 11. Having won 89 seats in the assembly election, DMK can nominate two candidates, each requiring the support of 34 legislators. Six MPs from TN have completed their six-year RS term. Of these, three are from AIADMK, two from DMK and one from Congress. With 134 members in the 15th assembly, AIADMK can send four MPs to the Rajya Sabha, taking its strength in the Upper House to 13. "We have nominated Elangovan and Bharathi for Rajya Sabha. Next time we will give a chance to members of the party's trade union," DMK chief M Karunanidhi told reporters, soon after announcing the names. "Along with Congress and IUML we have the backing of 99 MLAs. So, we can win support for only two MPs," Elangovan told TOI. Elangovan was a Lok Sabha MP from North Chennai during the 2009 election but lost to AIADMK in the 2014 Lok Sabha election in South Chennai. Bharathi has been the party's legal wing secretary and has contested election previously from Alandur. He was also Alandur municipality chairman for several years.</text>

	<text>Chennai: It was a momentous occasion for tiny Wallajabad railway station in Kancheepuram district, about 100 km from here, on Saturday evening. The first batch of cars were loaded on to a freight train from Southern Railway's common user rail-auto hub, the first in the country. The train, carrying 124 cars from auto major Hyundai's factory in Sriperumbudur and bound for Changsari in Assam's Kamrup district, has 25 specially designed wagons each capable of carrying five cars. Southern Railway will earn 16.37 lakh from the trip. Located 12km-40 km from manufacturing units of auto MNCs like Nissan, Hyundai and Ford in such areas as Oragadam, Sriperumbudur and Singaperumal Kovil, the hub is designed to help cars be driven on stone-paved tracks into the wagon. It is expected to cater to more than one million cars annually produced in these areas and will also see trains bringing cars for distribution in Tamil Nadu and adjoining states. Southern Railway, aiming to capture the export market through Chennai and Ennore ports, will use trains to transport cars to and from the two ports and hopes to increase freight earnings that are now just half its total earnings. Transporting freight earns railways profits and also helps its cross-subsidises ticket fare for passenger trains; freight earnings are key for every railway zone. Wallajabad station, strategically located on the Chengalpet-Tirumalpur section, is connected to Arakkonam as well as Chennai Beach. Freight trains through Arakkonam can transport cars across the country; some can be sent to Chennai port, located next to Chennai Beach station on the Walajahbad-Chengalpet-Beach route. This is faster than the congested road network, say officials. The rail-auto hub, they add, has come as a boon at a time when the Chennai Port-Maduravoyal elevated expressway project, aimed at boosting the export plans of auto majors, is stuck in court. The move to develop Walajahbad as a rail auto hub was announced in the railway budget in February and the hub was inaugurated by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu on March 1. It can hold 300 cars and is linked by seamless four/six lane roads to production centres. All infrastructure facilities have been developed in-house by railways.</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: While there is a big question mark over the future of the Captain Vijayakant Front, a look at the votes polled by its candidates in 232 constituencies emphasized its non-viability as a third alternative. Besides DMDK leader Vijaykant, who polled just 15% of the total votes polled in his Ulundurpet constituency, losing his deposit, all other candidates too polled less than half of what the two Dravidian parties secured. The third front contested in all 234 constituencies and DMDK fielded candidates in 104 constituencies. In the 2011 election, the total vote share of DMDK, CPI, CPM and VCK was 13.77%. MDMK did not contest in the 2011 assembly election and Congress had been undivided then. But in the 2016 election, the total vote share of People' Welfare Front (PWF), TMC and DMDK adds up to 6.11%. An analysis of the total votes polled by various parties in the 2016 election shows that the third front candidate did come any where close to the two Dravidian parties and the real contest was only between AIADMK and DMK and their alliance partners. In Uludurpet, Vijayakant secured only 34,447 votes while DMK candidate, who came second, got 77,809 votes. In Arani, DMDK's R M Babu Murugavel, fielded there for the second consecutive time, polled 7,025 votes and came fourth. It was not just DMDK MLAs, who scored badly, even the performance of the left camarades was below average. CPM candidate A Soundara Rajan, who won the Perambur seat in 2011 in alliance with AIADMK by a margin of 17,423 votes, secured 10,281 votes there this election and lost his deposit. Most of the candidates from the third front lost their deposit as they did not get the mandatory 1/6th of the total votes polled in the constituency. In Thiruthuraipoondi, a CPI pocket borough, the party's candidate K Ulaganathan trailed in the third position with 33,038 votes. A reserved constituency, Thiruthuraipoondi has favoured only CPI and the party has won nine times since the 1957 election. This time DMK stormed the left bastion. TMC candidate from Vaniyambadi C Gnanasekaran lost his deposit. A senior leader of the party Gnanasekaran has won from Vellore and nearby constituencies in several elections in the past. But this election, he trailed behind AIADMK and DMK candidates with 21,090 votes. "This election has been a real test for small parties, including the Left. Except for VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan in Katturmannarkoil and CPI's T Ramachandran in Thalli all other candidates from the third front trailed in the third or fourth position in their constituency and lost their deposits. It also proved that these candidates have no local support base," said political analyst Badri Seshadri. The two Dravidian parties contested against each other in 171 constituencies and of this DMK won 89 and AIADMK 81. In the northern and parts of western constituencies (Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts), PMK has split the votes and has come third. "As of now PMK is the only alternative to AIADMK and DMK as it has got a better vote share (5.3%) despite not winning any seat," said Seshadri.</text>

	<text>Chennai: "The governor appointed her as CM of Tamil Nadu and invited her to form the ministry," said a statement from Raj Bhavan. Subsequently, the CM-designate handed over a letter containing the names of MLAs to be inducted into her cabinet. Rosaiah, who approved the list, also appointed S Semmalai (Mettur) as speaker pro-tem. He will take oath before the Governor at 1.30pm on Monday at Raj Bhavan. Some senior ministers have been rewarded with additional ministries. Highways and minor ports minister Edappadi K Palaniswami also gets public works department, while cooperative minister Sellur K Raju gets labour as well. Municipal administration and rural administration minister S P Velumani has been entrusted with 'special programme,' the department entrusted with the delivery of welfare schemes. The cabinet includes two young faces, V M Rajalakshmi, 30, (Adi Dravidar and tribal welfare) and M Manikandan, 39, (information technology). Three women, besides Jayalalithaa, find place in the new cabinet. Dindigul strongman and former MP C Srinivasan, who was sidelined for a few years due to infighting in the district unit headed by his protege Natham R Viswanathan, has been made forest minister. Another former MP, O S Manian has been made handlooms and textiles minister. Manian was recently appointed the Nagapattinam district secretary. R Kamaraj (food, civil supplies and HR&amp;CE), C Vijaya Baskar (health) and R B Udhayakumar (revenue) will retain their portfolios. P Thangamani gets electricity, a portfolio held earlier by Natham Vishwanathan and riddled with allegations of corruption in power purchase agreements, the major poll plank of the opposition in assembly polls. Vishwanathan was defeated in Athoor constituency. M C Sampath will hold industries that has a huge task of realising Rs2.4 lakh crore investment commitments made in the global investors meet. S P Shanmuganathan (milk and dairy development), K T Rajenthra Bhalaji (rural industries) and K C Veeramani (commercial taxes). Long-time loyalists and former ministers D Jayakumar (fisheries), C Ve Shanmugam (law, courts and prisons) and K P Anbazhagan (higher education) have been rewarded. Former Rasipuram MP V Saroja gets social welfare and noon meal, while Srirangam MLA S Valarmathi has been allotted backward classes and minorities' welfare. Valarmathi, a former Trichy corporation councillor, won a bypoll in Srirangam in 2014, necessitated by Jayalalithaa vacating the seat after her conviction in the wealth case by a Bengaluru trial court. Recognising their long service in the party, Jayalalithaa has handpicked some key functionaries like TN Arasu Cable TV Corporation chairman Udumalai K Radhakrishnan (housing and urban development minister); Papanasam Union secretary R Duraikannu (agriculture); Tuticorin district J Jayalalithaa Peravai secretary Kadambur Raju (information and publicity) and former MLA and Bhavani municipal chairman K C Karuppannan (environment). Greater Chennai Corporation deputy mayor P Benjamin will get school education and sports and youth welfare.</text>

	<text>Chennai: If EC review is anything to go by, CPM may lose its recognition as a national party due to its poor showing in the assembly polls in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. As per the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, a party is recognized as being national, if it has 11 Lok Sabha MPs (2% of the total number of LS seats), or at least 6% of votes in LS/assembly polls in at least four states in addition to winning four LS seats. The party is allowed to get the national status, if it is recognized as state party in at least four states. The party fulfils the criteria as a state party in only three states, West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. In TN, the party secured only 0.7% votes, and in Puducherry, an Independent candidate of Mahe, V Ramachandran, who has the party's backing, won the poll. "But this may not be considered as the candidate contested in symbol meant for independent," said an election officer.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The newly elected president of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena will be visiting India on February 16. This visit is significant for both the countries. Sirisena has indicated on the day of ascension to office that his maiden foreign visit would be to India. Days after winning the historic Presidential elections, he dispatched his new foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera to New Delhi with a clear message that the new Sri Lankan dispensation looks up to India with hope for strengthening bilateral relations. As close neighbours India and Sri Lanka have enjoyed good relations for decades. Sri Lanka was one of the active participants in Nehru's Non Aligned Movement - NAM diplomacy. Things turned sour in '80s when the ethnic strife started vitiating the atmosphere in the island nation. India had to struggle hard to maintain a balance between its domestic political compulsions and international obligations. In the process it has created enemies and friends on both sides. 2008-09 was a turning point in Sri Lankan history. After months of bloody battles across the Northern Province, the Sri Lankan Army had finally decimated the LTTE, thus bringing to an end 25 years of armed ethnic conflict. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa overnight transformed into a national hero and a cult figure. Rajapaksa decided to use this favourable political climate to advance the Presidential elections. Although his first term as President was to end in November 2010 he went ahead and held the elections in January 2010. Fresh from the success in the war against LTTE, Rajapaksa earned a convincing victory over his rival Gen. Sarath Fonseka by a margin of over 20 lakh votes. Interestingly he also secured a favourable judgment from the country's Supreme Court to begin his Presidential tenure as per schedule in November 2010. Rajapaksa's second term as president was to end in November 2016. He started off the second term with high popularity ratings. However in four years his popularity started dipping. Country's economy too started slipping into a morass. Allegations of corruption, nepotism, centralisation of powers and disaffection in various ethnic and religious communities have surrounded his regime. Realising that waiting till 2016 would further dampen his prospects of re-election he chose to advance the Presidential elections to January 2015. Had he won the elections he would have started his third term in November 2016 and continued as the President till November 2022. But the run up to the elections in January 2015 saw many dramatic developments in the country's politics. One of his closest aides in the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party - SLFP and a Minister in his Cabinet Maithripala Sirisena had suddenly decided to come out and join hands with the Opposition. This was a major blow to the already struggling Rajapaksa's regime. Until then the Opposition was in a lacklustre condition. Sirisena's entry had helped in galvanising the Opposition. Although Rajapaksa's regime gave the Opposition only 30 days to become battle-fit, things moved so swiftly against Rajapaksa that in the end he lost the elections, in a nail biting finish, by around 5 lakh votes.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: India is looking forward to US President Barack Obama's visit to Delhi as the guest of honour at this year's Republic Day parade on January 26. Neither the fact that he is the outgoing president nor that it is his second visit as president dampens the enthusiasm in the Indian establishment. Coming a few months after the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, this visit has understandably been seen by some as India's effort at a balancing act. However it must be kept in mind that Prime Minister Modi's foreign policy approach is nonconventional. He has freed Indian diplomacy from romantic slogan-mongering and embarked on a pragmatic 'India's interest' path. Even when he is on a multilateral mission his focus is on bilateralism with 'India's interest' as the benchmark. Thus for him, the visit of the Chinese president and the forthcoming visit of the US president are, far from being a balancing act, two independent events that have great bearing on India's diplomatic objectives. READ ALSO: Unprecedented seven-layer security ring for Obama's India visit US-India relations have seen many ups and downs. When Prime Minister Modi took over many skeptics thought that the relationship would go from bad to worse because of the visa related acrimony between the two in the last one decade. But Prime Minister Modi displayed great statesmanship by leaving behind all the personal insults and ill-will and embarking on a major charm offensive. As an astute politician he used his visit to the US in September last to attend the United Nations General Assembly to set bilateral relations on a different course. He spent just 24 hours in Washington DC. But in that short visit he was able to achieve so much, the most important being the demolition of the skepticism and creation of confidence. President Obama too responded positively to the overtures thus laying a firm foundation for a redefined relationship. READ ALSO: US asks for a no-fly zone over Rajpath on R-Day, India says no Agencies in overdrive for Obama's R-Day security India and US are the world's most populous and successful democracies. Both share several political, ethical and moral values. Thus the two are seen by many as natural allies. India's four million strong diaspora population is a binding factor between the two countries. Both have benefited in all these years whenever the relations were cordial. Both have suffered due to misunderstandings and consequent strain in relationship too. The joint statement issued by both the leaders during PM Modi's visit to Washington DC comprehensively outlined the agenda for cooperation and development. It described the new initiative as a "long-term vision for a resilient and ambitious partnership" and "guiding framework" for the people and the government. The joint statement aptly underscored that 'prosperity and security' are the expected end result of the strategic partnership between the two countries. On his part, Prime Minister Modi was categorical in emphasizing that India accords 'priority' to its partnership with the United States in order to 'realize India's rise as a responsible, influential world power'.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: The Egyptian military found the personal belongings of passengers and other debris from an EgyptAir jet floating in the Mediterranean, Cairo said on Friday, confirming that the plane had plunged into the sea with 66 people on board. The navy said it had found the debris about 290 km (180 miles) north of the coastal city of Alexandria and was sweeping the area in search of the plane's black box recorders. President Adbel Fattah al-Sisi offered condolences for those on board, amounting to Cairo's official confirmation of their deaths. Although fingers pointed towards Islamist militants who blew up another airliner over Egypt just seven months ago, no group had claimed responsibility more than 24 hours after the disappearance of flight MS804, an Airbus A320 that was flying from Paris to Cairo. Three French investigators and a technical expert from Airbus arrived in Cairo early on Friday to help investigate the fate of the missing plane, airport sources said. Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said on Thursday that it was too early to rule out any explanation for the disaster. The country's aviation minister said a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure. Friday's announcement that debris had been found followed earlier confusion about whether wreckage had been located. Greek searchers found some material on Thursday, but the airline later said this was not from its plane. While there was no official explanation of the cause of the crash, suspicion immediately fell on Islamist militants who have been fighting against Egypt's government since Sisi toppled an elected Islamist leader in 2013. In October, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian jetliner that exploded after taking off from an Egyptian tourist resort. Russian investigators blamed a bomb smuggled on board. Last year's crash already devastated Egypt's tourist industry, one of the main sources of foreign exchange for a country of 80 million people, and another similar attack would crush hopes of it recovering. While most governments were cautious about jumping to conclusions, US Republican candidate for president Donald Trump tweeted swiftly after the plane's disappearance: "Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?" Many hours later his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton also said it appeared to be an act of terrorism, although she said an investigation would have to determine the details. Officials from a number of US agencies told Reuters that a US review of satellite imagery so far had not produced any signs of an explosion. They said the United States had not ruled out any possible causes for the crash, including mechanical failure, terrorism or a deliberate act by the pilot or crew. Amid uncertainty about what brought down the plane, Los Angeles International Airport became the first major US air transportation hub to say it was stepping up security measures. LIVES ARE SO CHEAP The plane vanished just as it was exiting air space controlled by Greece for air space controlled by Egypt. Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos said the Airbus swerved radically and plunged from 37,000 feet to 15,000 before vanishing from Greek radar screens. According to Greece's civil aviation chief, calls from Greek air traffic controllers to MS804 went unanswered just before it left Greek airspace, and it disappeared from radar screens soon afterwards. There was no official indication of a possible cause, whether technical failure, human error or sabotage. Ultra-hardline Islamists have targeted airports, airliners and tourist sites in Europe, Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle Eastern countries over the past few years. The aircraft was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two infants, and 10 crew, EgyptAir said. They included 30 Egyptian and 15 French nationals, along with citizens of 10 other countries. A320s normally seat 150 people. The plane had made scheduled flights to Tunisia and Eritrea on Wednesday before arriving in Paris from Cairo. At Cairo airport, a man sat on a brown leather couch crying with his hands covering his face on Thursday. "How long will Egypt live if human lives are so cheap?" he said. The mother of a flight attendant rushed in tears out of the VIP hall where families waited. She said the last time her daughter called her was Wednesday night. "They haven't told us anything," she said.</text>

	<text>Women in Iran are cutting their hair short and dressing as men in a bid to bypass state 'morality' police who rigorously enforce penalties for not wearing a hijab. A number of women have shared photos of themselves in public with their hair uncovered on Instagram and other social media. The women have cut their hair short in some images and in others are dressed in clothes more typically associated with men. The hijab is becoming an increasingly contentious issue in Iran as women step up their campaign against it and other oppressive, gendered laws. In recent months, women have been filmed walking through Tehran with their hair uncovered and activists have urged Western tourists to violate laws by refusing to wear the hijab during their visits to the Islamic republic. But the response from authorities to this resistance has been severe. A politician was disqualified from Iranian parliament after photos purporting to show her in public without a headscarf emerged, despite her insistence they were fake. This week, eight models were reportedly detained for posting "vulgar" pictures on social media with their hair uncovered. One was pictured apparently making a public apology on state TV. Fearing similar repercussions, many women have now made their profiles private. In a photo that provoked a particularly strong reaction on Instagram, a woman took a selfie while driving in her car with short hair, without a hijab on, as a man on a scooter rode past. In another, a girl appears with short hair and wearing a shirt and jeans. The caption next to the picture reads: "I am an Iranian girl. In order to avoid the morality police, I decided to cut my hair short and wear men's clothes so that I can freely walk in the streets in Iran." The issue of compulsory hijab is also being raised by men. On 14 May, Pejman Rahbar, an Iranian sports journalist, shared a picture of a girl who had dressed up as a man to attend a football match alongside a picture of a male coach. the independent</text>

	<text>PARIS: France's aviation safety agency said Saturday that the EgyptAir A320 that crashed into the eastern Mediterranean with 66 people on board had transmitted automatic messages indicating smoke in the cabin. "There were ACARS messages emitted by the plane indicating that there was smoke in the cabin shortly before data transmission broke off," a spokesman of France's Bureau of Investigations and Analysis told AFP. ACARS, which stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, is a digital system that transmits short messages between aircraft and ground stations. The spokesman said it was "far too soon to interpret and understand the cause of Thursday's accident as long as we have not found the wreckage or the flight data recorders." The signals indicated there was smoke in the front toilets near the cockpit, an expert told AFP. According to the specialised aviation website Avherald, the ACARS messages read "smoke lavatory smoke" then "avionics smoke" -- referring to the plane's electronic systems -- then a "fault" with the FCU, the pilots' flight control unit in the cockpit. The warnings began about three minutes before air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane at 0029 GMT on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, earlier reported that automated warning messages indicated smoke in the nose of the aircraft and an apparent problem with the flight control system. The messages indicated intense smoke in the front portion of the plane, specifically the lavatory and the equipment compartment beneath the cockpit. The error warnings also indicated that the flight control computer had malfunctioned, the report said. CNN also reported smoke alerts on the flight minutes before it crashed, citing an Egyptian source. On Friday, search teams found wreckage including seats and luggage about 290 kilometres (180 miles) north of Egypt's coastal city of Alexandria, Egypt's military said. The plane disappeared off the radar without emitting any distress signal between the Greek island of Karpathos and the Egyptian coast. It turned sharply twice in Egyptian airspace before plunging 22,000 feet (6,700 meters) and vanishing from radar screens, Greece's defence minister has said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday the disappearance of an EgyptAir plane over the Mediterranean looked like an act of terrorism, making the link before authorities involved in the investigation did so. Authorities in Egypt and France said it was too soon to say what caused the Airbus A320 carrying 66 people to come down on its way from Paris to Cairo. In a morning Twitter post, Trump said: "Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness!" The post came several hours before a Greek warship searching for the jet found two large plastic objects floating in the sea and Egypt's aviation minister said a terrorist attack was more likely to have taken down the aircraft than a technical failure. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a Republican who served in Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, said Trump's tweet came too soon before officials had a chance to discover what happened. "It prejudges the outcome," Gates told MSNBC. "It's always better to wait until you act - know what the facts are before you open up. I realize that's a very unusual thing in American politics, but it ought to be tried occasionally." Obama was briefed on the missing plane and has directed officials to offer US assistance, the White House said.</text>

	<text>DUBAI: A woman in Saudi Arabia was divorced by her husband minutes after their marriage as she ignored him and kept on chatting with her friends on mobile phone, a media report said today. Following the marriage ceremony, the newly-wed couple went to a hotel where she began exchanging messages with her friends soon after they entered their room. The groom wanted to talk to her but she ignored him. When he asked her about the reasons, the bride said she was busy communicating with her friends who were congratulating her on their marriage on the mobile, Gulf News reported. The groom then asked her to chat later but she refused and became angry. At this, he asked if her friends were more important than him, the bride answered yes, Saudi daily Al Watan quoted one of their relatives as saying. As the argument heated up, the groom told his bride he was divorcing her and left the hotel. A divorce case has been filed and the court referred it to the reconciliation committee to assess if the couple could be reconciled. The groom, however, was too hurt in his pride to forgive and refused to withdraw the case and insisted on the divorce, the report said.</text>

	<text>TEL AVIV: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was on Sunday in Israel to advance his country's plan to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in the face of opposition from his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu. Valls, who arrived on Saturday night, is to meet Netanyahu on Monday before travelling to Ramallah on Tuesday to hold talks with Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas has welcomed the French initiative to hold a meeting of foreign ministers from a range of countries on June 3, without the Israelis and Palestinians present. Another conference would then be held in the autumn, with the Israelis and Palestinians in attendance. The goal is to eventually restart negotiations that would lead to a Palestinian state. Negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians have been at a standstill since a US-led initiative collapsed in April 2014. In an interview with Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam published on Sunday, Valls said that Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank must stop. But he also reiterated that his government would not automatically recognise a Palestinian state if the peace initiative failed. A threat to do so was made in January by former foreign minister Laurent Fabius, angering the Israeli government. His successor Jean-Marc Ayrault has since backed away from the statement. "The objective is to arrive at the creation of a Palestinian state," Valls said in the interview. "It is to allow your national aspirations to finally be realised. To say today when we will recognise the Palestinian state is to determine in advance the failure of our initiative." Valls said "we must also guarantee" Israel's security, but called for a halt to settlement building, considered a major stumbling block to peace. Settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law and built on land the Palestinians see as part of their future state. "Stopping settlements is an imperative," he said. "Because we cannot both want to discuss peace and be sincere in the negotiations and at the same time continue to create facts on the ground." Valls's visit comes at a time of political turbulence in Israel, with Netanyahu expected to soon finalise negotiations with the party of hardliner Avigdor Lieberman, detested by the Palestinians, to join his coalition. Lieberman, who lives in a West Bank settlement, is expected to take on the key role of defence minister. On Sunday, Valls' visit was mainly devoted to economic and cultural issues.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: Egyptian aviation officials say an EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo with 66 passengers and crew on board has crashed. The officials say the search is now underway for the debris. They say the "possibility that the plane crashed has been confirmed," as the plane hasn't landed at any of the nearby airports. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. EgyptAir Flight 804 was lost from radar at 2:45 am local time when it was flying at 37,000 feet, the airline said. It said the Airbus A320 had vanished 10 miles (16 kilometers) after it entered Egyptian airspace. Egyptian military aircraft were searching for the plane, which was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two babies, and 10 crew members. The pilot had 6,000 flight hours. Earlier, the airline said 69 people were on board. EgyptAir later said those on board included 15 French passengers, 30 Egyptians, one Briton, two Iraqis, one Kuwaiti, one Saudi, one Sudanese, one Chadian, one Portuguese, one Belgian, one Algerian and one Canadian. Egypt's state-run newspaper Al-Ahram quoted an airport official as saying the pilot did not send a distress call, and that last contact with the plane was made 10 minutes before it disappeared from radar. It did not identify the official. Airbus is aware of the disappearance, but "we have no official information at this stage of the certitude of an accident," the company's spokesman Jacques Rocca said. The Paris airport authority and the French civil aviation authority would not immediately comment. Queries about the missing plane sent out to the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency were not returned early Thursday. French president Francois Hollande spoke with Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the phone and agreed to "closely cooperate to establish as soon as possible the circumstances" in which the EgyptAir flight disappeared, according to a statement issued in Paris. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said no scenario could be ruled out at the moment as for what caused the plane to disappear. France, he told RTL radio, was "ready" to join the search operation if Egyptian authorities requested his country's assistance. Around 15 relatives of passengers on board the missing flight have arrived at Cairo airport. Airport authorities brought doctors to the scene after several distressed family members collapsed. Neither France's Foreign Ministry nor Interior Ministry would comment on the disappearance or on whether it could have been an attack. France remains under a state of emergency after Islamic extremist attacks killed 130 people in a spree of attacks in November claimed by the extremist Islamic State group. Greece joined the search and rescue operation for the EgyptAir flight with two aircraft: one C-130 and one early warning aircraft, officials at the Hellenic National Defense General Staff said. They said one frigate was also heading to the area, and helicopters are on standby on the southern island of Karpathos for potential rescue or recovery operations. An EgyptAir plane was hijacked and diverted to Cyprus in March. A man who admitted to the hijacking and is described by Cypriot authorities as "psychologically unstable" is in custody in Cyprus. The incident renewed security concerns at Egyptian airports after a Russian passenger plane crashed in Sinai last October, killing all 224 people on board. Moscow said it was brought down by an explosive device, and a local branch of the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for planting it. In 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217 people aboard, US investigators filed a final report that concluded its co-pilot switched off the autopilot and pointed the Boeing 767 downward. But Egyptian officials rejected the notion of suicide altogether, insisting some mechanical reason caused the crash.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The Islamic State group has continued losing control over territory across Iraq and Syria, a Pentagon spokesman said on Monday, including almost half of what it had once held in Iraq. The defense department had previously estimated that Is fighters had lost control of about 40 per cent of the territory they claimed in Iraq and about 10 per cent of the land they held in Syria. Those tallies had gone up in recent weeks, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said. "The number right now in Iraq is about 45 per cent of the territory they once held has been recovered," Cook said. "The number in Syria is anywhere between 16 to 20 per cent." IS jihadists stormed across large parts of Iraq and Syria in early 2014, meeting little resistance from Iraqi security forces and exploiting the chaos in civil-war-torn Syria. Since August 2014, the United States has led an international coalition fighting back against the IS group, using a combination of air strikes and training and equipping local partners. IS fighters have lost control of Ramadi and Heet in Iraq, but still control other important cities including Mosul and Fallujah. In Syria, the group maintains control of Raqa, the capital of their so-called caliphate.</text>

	<text>BEIRUT: Syrian government forces and allies including Lebanese Hezbollah fighters seized a strategic town southeast of Damascus from insurgents on Thursday, a monitoring group said. After heavy fighting in an assault by the government side, rebels were being driven out of the town of Deir al-Asafir in the Syrian capital's Eastern Ghouta suburbs, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The town's capture closed off a pocket of insurgent control in Eastern Ghouta, and could pave the way for further government advances in the region that has long been held by a number of rebel groups, Observatory director Rami Abdulrahman said. Hezbollah fighters played a key role in the assault, he said, which took place near to where the group's top military commander in Syria was recently killed by what it said was rebel shellfire. Hundreds of families were fleeing the area because of the intensity of the fighting, the Observatory said. Government forces and their allies have made some advances in Eastern Ghouta recently while insurgent groups in the area have fought among themselves. The capture of Deir al-Asafir was an advance that once again exploited the rebel infighting, Abdulrahman said.</text>

	<text>PARIS/CAIRO: The EgyptAir jet which crashed in the Mediterranean on Thursday sent a series of warnings indicating that smoke had been detected on board, shortly before it disappeared off radar screens, French investigators said on Saturday. A spokesman for France's BEA air accident investigation agency said the signals did not indicate what caused the smoke or fire on board the plane, which plunged into the sea with 66 people on board as it was heading from Paris to Cairo. But they offered the first clues as to what unfolded in the moments before the crash. One aviation source said that a fire on board would likely have generated multiple warning signals, while a sudden explosion may not have generated any - though officials stress that no scenario, including explosion, is being ruled out. Egypt said its navy had found human remains, wreckage and the personal belongings of passengers floating in the Mediterranean about 290 km (180 miles) north of Alexandria. The army published pictures on Saturday on its official Facebook page of the recovered items, which included blue and white debris with EgyptAir markings, seat fabric with designs in the airline's colors, and a yellow lifejacket. Analysis of the debris and recovery of the plane's twin flight recorders are likely to be key to determining the cause of the crash - the third blow since October to Egypt's travel industry, still reeling from political unrest following the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. A suspected Islamic State bombing brought down a Russian airliner after it took off from Sharm el-Sheikh airport in late October, killing all 224 people on board, and an EgyptAir plane was hijacked in March by a man wearing a fake suicide belt. The October crash devastated Egyptian tourism, a main source of foreign exchange for a country of 80 million people, and another similar incident would crush hopes of it recovering. Egypt's tourism revenue in the first three months of the year plunged by two thirds to $500 million from a year earlier. HUNT FOR BLACK BOXES The signals from the plane "do not allow in any way to say what may have caused smoke or fire on board the aircraft", said a spokesman for the French BEA agency, which is assisting an official Egyptian investigation. He added that the priority now was to find the two flight recorders, known as black boxes, containing cockpit voice recordings and data readings, from the Airbus A320 which vanished from radar early on Thursday. The plane came down in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean, a source in the Egyptian-led investigation said. Another person familiar with Western naval estimates said the wreckage could be in waters 2,000 to 3,000 meters deep. That would place the black box locator beacons, which last for 30 days, on the edge of their detectable range from the surface based on the type of acoustic equipment typically used during the first stages of a search, according to a report into the 2009 crash of an Air France jet in the Atlantic. Egyptair said in a statement that officials met family members and told them the process of gathering body parts and information would take time. DNA testing to identify victims would require weeks, the airline said. The flight data transmitted before the crash was sent through an automatic system called the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which routinely downloads maintenance and fault data to the airline operator. Aviation Herald, a respected Austria-based website specializing in air accidents, first published a burst of seven messages broadcast over the space of three minutes. These included alarms about smoke in the lavatory as well as the aircraft's avionics area, which sits under the cockpit. While suggesting a possible fire, the relatively short sequence of data gives no insight into pilot efforts to control the aircraft, nor does it show whether it fell in one piece or disintegrated in mid-air, two aviation safety experts said. The data fragments also included alarms related to cockpit window heating and two flight control computers, both of which have backups. "The question now is whether the fire that caused the smoke was the result of an electrical fault - for example a short-circuit caused by damaged wiring - or whether some form of explosive or incendiary device was used - for example by a terrorist - to generate a fire or other damage," aviation safety expert David Learmont said. The ACARS data suggested the fire had spread quickly and "that might explain the fact that there was no distress call", Learmont wrote in a blog. The aircraft was carrying 56 passengers, including a child and two infants, and 10 crew. They included 30 Egyptian and 15 French nationals, along with citizens of 10 other countries. "At this very moment all scenarios are being examined and none is being given greater emphasis," French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told reporters after meeting relatives of the victims of the EgyptAir crash. France sent an airplane and navy ship to help search for the jet. Three representatives of the BEA, together with an expert from Airbus, were in Cairo to help with the investigation. The naval search is centered on an area north of Alexandria, just south of where the signal from the plane was lost early on Thursday. EgyptAir Chairman Safwat Moslem said the radius of the search zone was 40 nautical miles, but could be expanded. The radius is equivalent to an area of 5,000 square miles (17,000 square km), the same expanse covered in the initial hunt for the Air France jet in 2009. The large area reflects the fact that neither jet could be accounted for in the last few minutes of flying time. A European satellite spotted a 2 km-long oil slick in the Mediterranean, about 40 km (20 nautical miles) southeast of the aircraft's last known position, the European Space Agency said.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: Greek authorities have found "floating material" that is likely to be debris from the EgyptAir plane that crashed over the Mediterranean on Thursday as well as life jackets, the Egyptian civil aviation ministry said in a statement. An EgyptAir jet carrying 66 passengers and crew from Paris to Cairo disappeared from radar over the Mediterranean south of Greece on Thursday, with Athens saying the plane swerved in mid-air before plunging from cruising height and vanishing. Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said it was too early to rule out any explanation, including an attack like the one blamed for bringing down a Russian airliner over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula last year.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: An EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo with 66 passengers and crew on board crashed in the Mediterranean Sea off the Greek island of Crete early Thursday morning, Egyptian and Greek officials said. Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said it was too early to say whether a technical problem or a terror attack caused the plane to crash. "We cannot rule anything out," he told reporters at Cairo airport. EgyptAir Flight 804 was lost from radar at around 2:45am local time when it was flying at 37,000 feet, according to the airline. It said the Airbus A320 vanished 10 miles (16 kilometers) after it entered Egyptian airspace, around 280 kilometers (175 miles) off Egypt's coastline north of the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. Egyptian aviation officials said the plane crashed and that a search for debris was now underway. The "possibility that the plane crashed has been confirmed," as the plane hasn't landed in any of the nearby airports, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Konstantinos Lintzerakos, director of Greece Civil Aviation Authority, gave a roughly similar account to that given by EgyptAir. In comments to the private Antenna television, he said Greek air traffic controllers were in contact with the pilot who reported no problems as the aircraft cruised at 37,000 feet, traveling at 519 mph (830 kilometers per hour). The controllers tried to make contact with the pilot 10 miles (16 kilometers) before the plane exited the Greek Flight Information Region, or FIR. The pilot did not respond, he said, and they continued to try to speak to him until 3:29 am local time (2:29 a.m. Egyptian time) when the plane disappeared from the radar inside Egypt's FIR, 11 kilometers (7 miles) southeast of the island of Crete. Egypt's state-run newspaper Al-Ahram quoted an airport official as saying the pilot did not send a distress call, and that last contact with the plane was made 10 minutes before it disappeared from radar. It did not identify the official. Egyptian military aircraft and navy ships were taking part in a search operation off Egypt's Mediterranean coast to locate the debris of the plane, which was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two babies, and 10 crew members. The pilot had more than 6,000 flight hours. Greece also joined the search and rescue operation, officials at the Hellenic National Defense General Staff said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault offered to send military planes and boats to join the Egyptian search for wreckage. "We are at the disposition of the Egyptian authorities with our military capacities, with our planes, our boats to help in the search for this plane," he said. He spoke after French President Francois Hollande held an emergency meeting at the Elysee Palace. Later, the French military said a Falcon surveillance jet monitoring the Mediterranean for migrants had been diverted to help search for the EgyptAir plane. Military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron told The Associated Press that the jet is joining the Egypt-led search effort, and the French navy may send another plane and a ship to the zone. Hollande spoke with Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the phone and agreed to ``closely cooperate to establish as soon as possible the circumstances'' surrounding the incident, according to a statement issued in Paris. In Cairo, el-Sissi convened an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, the country's highest security body. The council includes the prime minister and the defense, foreign and interior ministers, in addition to the chiefs of the intelligence agencies. Those on board, according to EgyptAir, included 15 French passengers, 30 Egyptians, two Iraqis, one Briton, one Kuwaiti, one Saudi, one Sudanese, one Chadian, one Portuguese, one Belgian, one Algerian and one Canadian. Ayrault confirmed that 15 French citizens were on board. Around 15 relatives of passengers on board the missing flight arrived at Cairo airport Thursday morning. Airport authorities brought doctors to the scene after several distressed family members collapsed. In Paris, relatives of passengers on the EgyptAir flight started arriving at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside the French capital, where their loved ones were last seen alive. A man and a woman, identified by airport staff as relatives of the flight's passengers, sat at an information desk near the EgyptAir counter at Charles de Gaulle Airport's Terminal 1. The woman was sobbing, holding her face in a handkerchief. The pair were led away by police and airport staff and did not speak to gathered journalists. The Airbus A320 is a widely used twin-engine, single-aisle plane that operates on short and medium-haul routes. Nearly 4,000 A320s are currently in use around the world. The ubiquity of the A320 means the plane has been involved in several accidents over the years. The last deadly crash involving the plane was Germanwings Flight 9525, in which all 150 onboard died when one of the pilots intentionally crashed it in the French Alps. Airbus said the aircraft was delivered to EgyptAir in 2003 and had logged 48,000 flight hours before it "was lost" over the Mediterranean. The European plane-maker said in a statement Thursday that it had engines made by Swiss-based engine consortium IAE, and had the serial number 2088. An EgyptAir plane was hijacked and diverted to Cyprus in March. A man who admitted to the hijacking and is described by Cypriot authorities as "psychologically unstable" is in custody in Cyprus. The incident renewed security concerns at Egyptian airports after a Russian passenger plane crashed in Sinai last October, killing all 224 people on board. Moscow said it was brought down by an explosive device, and a local branch of the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for planting it. In 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic near the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217 people aboard. US investigators filed a final report that concluded its co-pilot switched off the autopilot and pointed the Boeing 767 downward. Egyptian officials rejected the notion of suicide altogether, insisting some mechanical reason caused the crash.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: An EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo with 66 people, including 26 foreigners, on board on Thursday crashed in the Mediterranean Sea after it vanished from radar screens in Egyptian airspace, aviation officials said. Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said it was too early to say whether a technical problem or a terror attack caused the plane to crash. "We cannot rule anything out," he told reporters at Cairo airport. The Airbus A320 was flying at 37,000 feet when it disappeared shortly after entering Egyptian airspace at 2:45 am local time. EgyptAir Flight 804 lost contact with radar after it entered Egyptian airspace, around 280 kilometres off the country's coastline north of the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. The aviation officials later said the plane crashed and that a search for debris was now underway. The "possibility that the plane crashed has been confirmed," the officials said. EgyptAir said a "distress call" had been received from the plane two hours after it disappeared from radar. The Egyptian military, however, denied that any distress calls were received. Egyptian military search and rescue teams were combing the area to locate the debris of the plane, which was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two babies, and 10 crew members. Apart from 30 Egyptians, the plane was carrying 15 French passengers, two Iraqis and one each from Britain, Belgium, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Chad, Portugal, Algeria and Canada. The Egyptian military in cooperation with Greece has also deployed search aircraft and naval vessels to find the debris of the plane. French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault offered to send military planes and boats to join the Egyptian search for wreckage. French President Francois Hollande held an emergency meeting and also spoke with Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the phone and agreed "to closely cooperate to establish as soon as possible the circumstances" surrounding the incident, according to a statement issued in Paris. In March, another EgyptAir flight from Alexandria to Cairo was hijacked and forced to divert to Cyprus, where the hijacker demanded to see his former wife. He had claimed he was wearing an explosive vest, which turned out to be fake, and surrendered within hours after freeing the passengers and crew. In October, the Islamic State jihadist group claimed responsibility for bombing a Russian airliner flying home holidaymakers from the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board. The group said it had smuggled a bomb concealed in a soda can on board the plane at Sharm El-Sheikh airport.</text>

	<text>BEIRUT: A key rebel supply route to Aleppo has been the latest target of Russian warplanes in the latest round of ceasefire which has been on going since February, a monitoring group has said. "The Russian and Syrian warplanes together carried out at least 40 air strikes on the Castello road," Syrian Observatory for Human Rights chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. "They are the heaviest air strikes there since February, and they are also the first confirmed Russian strikes since the truce began," Abdel Rahman said. The violence wracking Aleppo city over the past month has killed some 300 civilians and left world powers scrambling to save the fragile truce brokered by the United States and Russia nearly three months ago. The northern city once Syria's commercial powerhouse is divided between rebel groups in the east and regime forces in the west. The Castello road is a key supply route for rebels leading north out of Aleppo. Even while the rest of the city witnessed relative calm in the first few weeks of the truce, fierce fighting has raged for the highway. On Friday, Moscow proposed joint air strikes with Washington against jihadists in Syria from Wednesday, but its offer was spurned. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since last September in support of its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Washington launched its air war against the Islamic State group and other jihadists in Syria in 2014. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said the US military does "not collaborate or coordinate with the Russians on any operations in Syria." US State Department spokesman John Kirby said nothing had been agreed with Moscow as its ally Damascus was responsible for the "vast majority" of violations of the February ceasefire. Russia's intervention has significantly strengthened the Syrian government in the five-year-old civil war that has killed more than 270,000 people and driven millions from their homes.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The top US military commander for the Middle East made a suprise visit to northern Syria on Saturday to witness efforts to build up local forces in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group, officials said. General Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command (Centcom), met US military advisors working with Syrian Arab fighters, a Centcom spokesman said. He also met leaders of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the spokesman said, without providing further details. During the secret trip, which lasted several hours, the Centcom commander visited a handful of locations, CNN reported as it accompanied Votel, the highest-ranking US military official to travel to Syria since its civil conflict began in 2011. US special operations forces are helping train fighters in Syria to combat the IS group as Washington leads a coalition of countries in an air war against the jihadists in Iraq and Syria. The IS group has seized swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq to create a self-styled "caliphate." Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has received pledges of allegiance from jihadist groups around the world. The United States has roughly 200 advisers on the ground in Syria, but no combat units. Votel's visit comes as the first of 250 more US special operations forces are beginning to arrive. Kurds play a dominant role in the US-backed SDF, providing the core of the forces that have pushed back the IS group group in the country's northeast. The SDF has a total of about 25,000 Kurdish fighters and about 5,000 Arab fighters. Washington is pushing to bring more Arab forces into the group. The Syrian war erupted in early 2011 after Assad's forces launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests, and has since claimed more than 270,000 lives. Votel's visit comes after international talks on ending the Syrian conflict broke up with no clear breakthrough earlier this week as new faction-fighting erupted and the death toll continued to mount.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: The Egyptian navy said on Friday it had found the personal belongings of passengers and other debris floating in the Mediterranean, confirmation that an EgyptAir jet had plunged into the sea with 66 people on board. The military said it had found the debris about 290 km (180 miles) north of the port city of Alexandria and was searching for the plane's black box flight recorders. Egypt's President Adbel Fattah al-Sisi offered condolences for those on board, amounting to Cairo's official acknowledgement of their deaths. The defence minister of Greece, which has also been scouring the Mediterranean, said Egyptian authorities had found a body part, luggage and a seat in the sea just south of where the signal from the plane was lost early on Thursday. Although suspicion pointed to Islamist militants who blew up another airliner over Egypt seven months ago, no group had claimed responsibility more than 24 hours after the disappearance of flight MS804, an Airbus A320 flying from Paris to Cairo. Three French investigators and a technical expert from Airbus arrived in Cairo early on Friday to help investigate the fate of the missing plane, airport sources said. Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said on Thursday that it was too early to rule out any explanation for the disaster. The country's aviation minister said a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure. Friday's announcement that debris had been found followed earlier confusion about whether wreckage had been located. Greek searchers found some material on Thursday, but the airline later said this was not from its plane. A European satellite spotted a 2 km-long oil slick in the Mediterranean, about 40 km southeast of the aircraft's last position, the European Space Agency said. SUSPICION FALLS ON MILITANTS While there was no official explanation of the cause of the crash, suspicion fell on the militants who have been fighting against Egypt's government since Sisi toppled an elected Islamist leader in 2013. In October, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian jetliner that exploded after taking off from an Egyptian tourist resort. Russian investigators blamed a bomb smuggled on board. Last year's crash devastated Egypt's tourist industry, one of the main sources of foreign exchange for a country of 80 million people, and another similar attack would crush hopes of it recovering. While most governments were cautious about jumping to conclusions, U.S. Republican candidate for president Donald Trump tweeted swiftly after the plane's disappearance: "Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?" Later in the day, his likely Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, also said it appeared to be an act of terrorism, although she said an investigation would have to determine the details. Officials from a number of U.S. agencies told Reuters that a US review of satellite imagery so far had not produced any signs of an explosion. They said the United States had not ruled out any possible causes for the crash, including mechanical failure, terrorism or a deliberate act by the pilot or crew. Amid uncertainty about what brought down the plane, Los Angeles International Airport became the first major U.S. air transportation hub to say it was stepping up security measures. LIVES ARE SO CHEAP The plane vanished just as it was exiting air space controlled by Greece for air space controlled by Egypt. Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos said the Airbus swerved radically and plunged from 37,000 feet to 15,000 before vanishing from Greek radar screens. According to Greece's civil aviation chief, calls from Greek air traffic controllers to MS804 went unanswered just before it left Greek airspace, and it disappeared from radar screens soon afterwards. There was no official indication of a possible cause, whether technical failure, human error or sabotage. Ultra-hardline Islamists have targeted airports, airliners and tourist sites in Europe, Egypt, Tunisia and other Middle Eastern countries over the past few years. Khaled al-Gameel, head of crew at EgyptAir, said the pilot, Mahamed Saeed Ali Shouqair, had 15 years' experience and was in charge of training and mentoring younger pilots. "He comes from a pilot family; his uncle was a high ranking pilot at EgyptAir and his cousin is also a pilot," Gameel said. "He was very popular and was known for taking it upon himself to settle disputes any two colleagues were having." A Facebook page which appeared to be Shouqair's showed no signs of Islamist sympathies. It included criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood, repostings of articles supporting President Sisi and pictures of Shouqair wearing aviator sunglasses. The aircraft was carrying 56 passengers, including one child and two infants, and 10 crew, EgyptAir said. They included 30 Egyptian and 15 French nationals, along with citizens of 10 other countries. A320s normally seat 150 people. The plane had made scheduled flights to Tunisia and Eritrea on Wednesday before arriving in Paris from Cairo. At Cairo airport, a man sat on a brown leather couch crying with his hands covering his face on Thursday. "How long will Egypt live if human lives are so cheap?" he said. The mother of a flight attendant rushed in tears out of the VIP hall where families waited. She said the last time her daughter called her was Wednesday night. "They haven't told us anything," she said.</text>

	<text>TEHRAN: India's flagship explorer ONGC is facing a repeat of KG fiasco in Iran as lengthy negotiations on terms may drive it to a point where its discovered gas reserves in Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf may be drawn out by neighbouring Saudi Arabia. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) alleges that 11.12 billion cubic meters of natural gas worth Rs 11,055 crore has flowed from its idling Krishna Godavari basin blocks in Bay of Bengal blocks to neighbouring KG-D6 fields of Reliance Industries. And the same is now on the verge of repeating in the Farzad-B field, which it had discovered in 2008 but no contract to exploit the 12.5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable reserves has so far been concluded with Iran. Sources said a portion of Farzad-B field extends into territorial waters controlled by Iran's regional arch-rival Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has already drilled wells on the area falling in its territory, which it has named Hasbah field, and has begun production. The two fields are connected, with the area falling in Iranian territory holding larger share of 12.5 Tcf of recoverable reserves while the Saudi territory has only 3 Tcf or so. But the two fields are connected and whosoever is able to move first would extract more benefits. Sources said in the dispute with RIL, ONGC is claiming compensation for its gas flowing through under-sea connected reservoir to KG-D6 and the government has constituted a one-man committee to look into the issue and suggest compensation. But such a thing may not be possible for Farzad-B as rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran may prevent from arriving at any internationally recognised practice of splitting the spoils in conjoined fields. It was expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Tehran today and tomorrow may see finalising of a contract, giving developmental rights of Farzad-B field to ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of the state explorer. But Iran is yet to agree to USD 4.3 billion master development plan submitted by OVL. Also, it is yet to agree on the price at which OVL can take all of the gas produced from the field, they said adding that no definitive contract for the development of the field would be signed during Modi's visit.</text>

	<text>DUBAI: An Indian sales executive and his 11- year-old son have been killed and his wife along with younger son injured in a tragic road accident in Dubai, a media report said today. The car crash occurred when the family members were on their way back to home after visiting a church in Dubai. CD Sunny, 46, had been working as a sales executive in Dubai for 24 years, Gulf News quoted the victims' family friends as saying. "Apparently a 4WD car banged their car from behind when they reached Muhaisna," said Praveen Jose, a neighbour of Sunny's family from Kecheri in Kerala. He said the elder son of Sunny, 11-year-old Alvin, was thrown out of the car due to the impact of the crash and died on the spot. Sunny died on the way to hospital, he said. Sunny's wife Jolly and second son Edwin, four, have been admitted to Rashid Hospital. "Edwin has fractured his leg... Jolly is completely shattered and is under sedation. The neighbour said Sunny's family used to live in Dubai earlier. They relocated to Kerala a few years ago. "The wife and children had come here on a visit due to school vacation in India. They came on April 23 and were scheduled to fly back on this 28th," Jose added.</text>

	<text>DUBAI: A mother of six in Saudi Arabia has burnt her house after learning that her husband had gone abroad for a second honeymoon, a media report said today. The woman, who has been married for 10 years, was shocked to receive a text message from her husband, that he married a second wife and was travelling abroad with her for their honeymoon, Gulf News reported. In a fit of rage, she set her home in Jazan port city on fire. However, when she saw the house being engulfed by the blaze, she raised an alarm for assistance from her neighbours, Saudi news website Al Sada reported. The fire was doused by the fire brigade. A fire official said that one child, reportedly aged five, was harmed in the blaze. The case was referred to the police for investigation.</text>

	<text>BEIRUT: At least 50 fighters and two civilians were killed today in clashes between rival anti-regime groups east of Syrian capital Damascus, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The powerful Jaish al-Islam, or Army of Islam, has been locked in clashes with rival factions led by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate in the opposition stronghold of Eastern Ghouta. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said nearly three weeks of fighting had killed more than 500 fighters and a dozen civilians. One of the slain civilians has been identified as the only specialist gynaecologist still practising in Eastern Ghouta. "This is absolutely a power struggle," Abdel Rahman said. Eastern Ghouta is the largest rebel bastion in Damascus province, and Jaish al-Islam had long been dominant in the district. The Saudi-backed faction is one of the key rebel players in the High Negotiations Committee, which represents Syria's opposition in UN-backed peace talks. But Jaish al-Islam has recently been challenged by Faylaq al-Rahman and Jaish al-Fustat, both led by Al-Nusra Front, Syria's Al-Qaeda affiliate. Residents and local officials have tried to mediate an end to the clashes and have staged protests urging the rival forces to stop the bloodletting to no avail. On Tuesday, a Jaish al-Islam spokesman said his faction was ready to put an end to the fighting based on an initiative by HNC head Riad Hijab. "But our brothers in Faylaq al-Rahman completely rejected this initiative," Islam Alloush said in a statement. Syria's fractured armed opposition movement has been ravaged by infighting, particularly between jihadist groups and their rivals. More than 270,000 people have been killed and millions more been driven from their homes since the conflict began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.</text>

	<text>Many successful Indian politicians are conspicuously single. The idea of a 24x7 neta minus parivar is obviously appealing Apart from their remarkable victories, what links J Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee and Sarbananda Sonowal? That they stand alone, with no immediate families around them. Out of this year's crop of chief ministers, Pinarayi Vijayan is the odd one out, for having a spouse and children. In a country that invests greatly in marriage and family, most successful politicians are conspicuously single. East, west, north or south, from Nitish Kumar to Mayawati, Vasundhara Raje to Naveen Patnaik, from Narendra Modi to Rahul Gandhi, there is no significant other by their side. What gives? Some, like Modi, have tried to spin their single status into a virtue  "I have no family ties, I am single. Who will I be corrupt for?" he asked during his prime-ministerial campaign. This is a view with wide traction; though there is zero evidence linking family ties with corruption. Besides, as Indians have observed, the absence of a formal family unit does not mean that an intimate circle cannot profit from their power. Foster families, close aides and their kin, nephews and nieces fill that space. So what purpose does singlehood serve in the public imagination? For one, there is the impression that "they have no other cause but the people, that their time, attention and priorities revolve around politics", says journalist Sankarshan Thakur. "In India, where politicians spend so much time with their supporters and constituents, the early grind can be very demanding," says social commentator Santosh Desai. Except it doesn't work that way, in general  marital status and work productivity are not at odds. Data suggests a "marriage wage premium" for men, meaning that married men tend to be more successful at work. But facts apart, there is an obvious appeal to the idea that being unmarried allows a person to be a 24x7 politician. Free of household duties, they can channel their energies into politics. "Chamaari hoon, kunwari hoon, tumhari hoon", was Mayawati's appeal to the electorate. Female politicians are readily understood as archetypes when they are single, says sociologist Shiv Visvanathan. "Whether it is Jayalalithaa's legendary excess or Mamata's legendary simplicity, their being single gives them a certain mystique," he says. In a male-dominated politics, it is important for them to be seen as self-directed and confidently alone to exert authority. But for most politicians, their singlehood is a matter-of-fact affair. In a country like the US, the First Spouse is vitally important, and families are put on display to testify to the candidate's credibility. Bachelordom would be suspect in such a context. "Our political culture is different, and families have always receded into the background," says Thakur. Wives and husbands are rarely seen and never heard. The media and public have largely refrained from prying into their romantic lives, considering it irrelevant to their political actions. "The separation between inside and outside is clear, in India. The face a politician presents to the world, and his or her private life, is seen as distinct," says Desai. In fact, the domestic life has often been cast as an encumbrance. Right from Mohandas Gandhi, whom Thakur calls India's first "married-single" politician, to Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Vajpayee, few of our leaders have been one half of a happy couple. Traditionally, even those who are married do not wheel their partners into the public eye, he notes. They are excused for being negligent towards their family for the sake of pressing public commitments. Of course, there is no one reason why people  politicians or otherwise  remain single. Some may not have found the right person, some may have willingly chosen not to marry, others may have romantic entanglements that never materialised into marriage, and some are estranged from their partners. Some are single because of their backgrounds, as RSS workers or preachers. There is no one explanation for their single status  "If you look at Vasundhara Raje or Mayawati or Nitish Kumar, their lives are so disparate, it is hard to find anything in common but the fact that they are all single," Thakur sums up.</text>

	<text>Jail inmates are fast emerging as the new labour workforce for India's private sector. Is it corporate opportunism, penal reform, or a bit of both? In the 21st century marketplace that makes much of the backstory of a product, here's a twist: the football, floor tile, shampoo, or car you own could have featured a prisoner in the workforce. The Indian prison industry  manufacturing for the state or making prison-branded goods so far  has lately started working for the private sector. From The Himalaya Drug Company and automotive component manufacturer Spark Minda Corporation, to small manufacturers in Meerut in UP and Yamunanagar in Haryana, the private sector has started outsourcing  or in prison parlance, 'in-sourcing'  jobs to jails. Himalaya's supply chain for alfalfa, a medicinal plant that it uses in several health products, can be traced to a prison farming programme established five years ago in Karnataka Open Air Jail, Bengaluru. It was later extended to three prisons in Andhra Pradesh and two in Goa. "Forty-five percent of our Alfalfa requirement is sourced through contract farming, of which about 3% comes from the Prison Farming Programme," says Himalaya CEO Philipe Haydon. "Our goal is to source the entire alfalfa requirement from this programme." Three months ago, 20 prisoners in Colvale Central Jail, North Goa were trained by the pharma's field staff in farming and harvesting. They're paid the state's daily prison wage of Rs 120 for skilled labour (Rs 80 for semi-skilled work). Himalaya provides the seeds and manure, and buys back the harvest, which varies from 6.5 to 8 metric tons per prison annually, at an undisclosed price. "Now that we're earning some revenue, we plan to expand such partnerships and scale up wages," says Elvis Gomes, Goa's IG, prisons. And so 10,000 square metres in Colvale and Sada Sub Jail have been set aside for the project. Late last year, 30 inmates at Pune's Yerwada Central Jail were recruited by Spark Minda, which started an assembly unit for automotive wiring harnesses there, after its successful operation in Tihar the year before. "We borrowed the idea from our counterparts in Germany who employed prisoners," says N K Taneja, Group Chief Marketing Officer. The company currently employs 80 inmates across both correctional facilities, but believes there's room for at least 200. "Before we got into this partnership, we ran it by our clients, Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra who approved of the initiative," he says. For optimal results from their two-month training, Spark Minda only hires convicts in for the long haul  five years and more. While all prisoners get a certificate of work, Yerwada's inmates earn Rs 200 a day, part of which goes to the prisoners' welfare fund and the institution itself, and Tihar's get the standard wage of Rs 110. Tihar also earns a separate monthly rent of Rs 12/sq ft from Spark Minda for use of their premises. Meanwhile, in Yamunanagar District Jail, 200km from Gurgaon, two dozen inmates produce ceramic floor tiles for a local firm. "They work six to eight hours a day for Rs 40," says IG Jagjeet Singh, adding that Ambala Central Jail produces steel furniture for another company. Indian prison officials speak glowingly of the PPP model  also interpreted as the Private Prison Partnership  saying its income offsets costs. (In 2014-15, the 88,221 inmates lodged in UP prisons cost the state Rs 74 lakh.) But the model also assists in rehabilitation by skilling prisoners for life beyond bars. And finally, as per prison wisdom, a 'busy convict is an easy convict'. Prison brass say convicts are never pressed into work, although they may be nudged. "We first select people who know the work, then bring in those interested but unskilled," explains DIG prisons, Telangana, VK Singh. The assembly of electric metre boxes for Hyderabad-based Linkwell Telesystems, and steel furniture for SS Industries are in-sourced to the central and open prisons in Cherlapalli. "We vet companies for security risks, potential environmental pollution, risk to prisoners' health, their business plans, and other factors. We have valuable land and we don't want firms that only wish to take advantage of our real estate," Singh maintains. Not to mention captive labour. The prison-industrial complex worldwide has been under greater scrutiny in recent years. Contracting companies in China and America have been condemned for their exploitative prisoner wages (as low as 2 cents an hour)  and for profiting off the taxpayer, as prisons are usually state funded. Moreover, companies don't have to worry about absenteeism or health benefits and pension. Nikhil Roy, programme development officer at the London-based Penal Reform International, believes there's nothing wrong with the profit motive. "It's the exploitation of prisoners that we need to guard against. Hence, the Mandela Rules (the UN's recently revised standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners) do not rule out profit but make it clear this should not be "subordinate" to the welfare of the prisoners," Roy says on email. The conservative view has long argued that prisoners don't deserve market minimum wages because the state sponsors their bed and board anyway. Also, their crime or alleged crime denies them equal wage rights. So income, however paltry, ought to be regarded as a bonus. But the reformist view is that even prisoners have families to support outside, and a decent income earned in incarceration will not only help their kin, but also give them a sense of purpose and dignity. (In some cases in Tihar, 25% of the convict's income is remitted to the family of his victim). But even though companies are less wary of their association with prisons today, calling it their CSR, jail authorities know they still have to tread lightly. "If we strike too hard a bargain on remuneration, companies will stay away," points out VK Singh. Kiran Bedi, former IG prisons, Tihar is credited with planting the PPP model in Delhi prisons in the '90s. "Today prison reform is a movement and big companies want their association with it to be visible; earlier they kept a low profile because it could have been be construed as forced work," she says. Signs of changing times are evident from the number of jails being roped in. While Spark Minda plans to set up a unit in Nagpur as well, Himalaya is scoping out Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Bedi, for one, is upbeat. "I am glad companies are coming in and skilling prisoners at a low cost. Entering a prison is not risk-free, and yet they come here instead of employing elsewhere. I look at it as the glass half full."</text>

	<text>Shah Shuja Durrani's autobiography is clear on how Ranjit Singh tortured his son to make him give up the diamond, writes William Dalrymple Earlier this month Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar told the Supreme Court that the Kohinoor was given freely to the British in the mid-19th century by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, and had been "neither stolen nor forcibly taken by British rulers". This was by any standards a strikingly unhistorical statement, all the odder because the facts of the case are not really in dispute. In truth, Ranjit Singh jealously guarded both his kingdom and his state jewels, and spent much of his adult life successfully keeping both from the grasping appetites of the militarised East India Company. By forming an alliance with the Company, but maintaining the most magnificent and up-to-date indigenous army of its day, he made sure that no Briton could enter the lands of the Khalsa without an invitation. Distinguished visitors like Emily Eden were allowed to see the Maharajah wearing the great jewel on his arm during state banquets, but when he died, he left the Kohinoor in his will not to the Company, nor to the British, nor even to Queen Victoria, but to the Jagannath temple at Puri. The British got their hands on the jewel only a decade later, after taking advantage of the Sikh divisions and general anarchy which engulfed the Punjab following Ranjit's death. They finally defeated the Khalsa during a series of notably bloody battles in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849. On March 29, 1849, the Kingdom of the Punjab was formally annexed by the Company, and the Last Treaty of Lahore was signed, officially ceding the Kohinoor to the Queen and the Maharaja's other assets to the Company. Article III of the treaty read: "The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja ool-Moolk by Maharajah Runjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England." On December 7, 1849, in the presence of the Board of Administration for the affairs of the Punjab, Duleep Singh, the ten-year-old son of Ranjit Singh, was compelled to hand over the great diamond. File photo of William Dalrymple. So who should now own the Kohinoor? The case is often made in India that as the Kohinoor was taken by the British at the point of a bayonet, the British must therefore give it back. Yet the reality is more muddy. While the Kohinoor certainly originated in India, most probably in the Kollur mines of Golconda, Persia, Afghanistan and Pakistan also have good claims on the jewel, as it was owned at different times by Nadir Shah of Persia, Ahmed Shah Durrani of Afghanistan, and Ranjit Singh of Lahore. All three countries have at different times claimed the jewel and issued legal action in attempt to get it back. Moreover, as the third article of the Treaty of Lahore hints, Ranjit Singh also took the jewel by force, just as the British did. In the same way that British sources tend to gloss over the violence inherent in their seizure of the stone, so Sikh ones do likewise. Yet the autobiography of its previous owner Shah Shuja Durrani, which I found in Kabul when I was working on my last book, Return of a King, is explicit about what happened. On arrival in Lahore, to which he had been invited by Ranjit on his fall from power, Shuja was separated from his harem, put under house arrest and told to hand over the diamond: "The ladies of our harem were accommodated in another mansion, to which we had, most vexatiously, no access," wrote Shuja in his Memoirs. "Food and water rations were reduced or arbitrarily cut off." Slowly, Ranjit increased the pressure. At the lowest ebb of his fortunes, Shuja was put in a cage, and according to his own account, his eldest son, Timur Shah, was tortured in front of him until he agreed to part with his most valuable possession. On June , 1813, Ranjit Singh was received by Shuja "with much dignity, and both being seated, a solemn silence ensued for nearly an hour. Ranjit then, getting impatient, whispered to one of his attendants to remind the Shah of the object of his coming. No answer was returned, but the Shah with his eyes made a signal to a eunuch, who retired, and brought in a small roll, which he set down on the carpet at an equal distance between the chiefs. Ranjit Singh desired his eunuch to unfold the roll, and when the diamond was recognized, the Sikh immediately retired with his prize in his hand." India's greatest diamonds  the Darya Nur, the Hope diamond, the Noor al-Ayn, the Orlov and Pitt-Regent diamond  all have exceptionally blood histories, with long litanies of betrayals, blindings, thefts, torture, assassination and murder associated with them. My personal view is that looking into the distant past, and attempting to right wrongs with claims for compensation and restitution, while understandable, is little more than a recipe for conflict and division. History everywhere is full of horrors and where should the accounts stop? Should the British sue Norway for Viking raids and Italy for the gold looted by the Romans? Should the Sri Lankan governments sue India for the destruction of the cities of Polonnoruwa and Anuradhapura by the Cholas in 993, when they invaded Sri Lanka, sacked all the towns, plundered the stupas and destroyed all the temples? According the Culavamsa chronicle: The Cholas violently destroyed here and there all the monasteries, Like blood-sucking yakkhas they took all the treasures of Lanka. They took away all valuables in the treasure house of the King, They plundered what there was to plunder in vihara and the town. The golden image of the Master [Buddha], The two jewels which had been set as eyes in the Prince of Sages, All these they took. They deprived the Island of Lanka of her valuables, Leaving the splendid town in a state as if it had been plundered by yakkhas. Rather than lawsuits, I think money and time would be better spent on proper education in history for all concerned. History is more complex and muddled than most people realise. How many Indians are aware, for example, of the bloody punitive raids the Chola navy made on the cities of Java and Indonesia when the coastal ports were looted and burned down? The British in particular need to learn what they did to pre-Colonial peoples across the world. For the same empire which led to the huge enrichment of Britain, conversely, led to the impoverishment of much of the rest of the non-European world. India and China, which until then had dominated global manufacturing, were two of the biggest losers in this story, along with hundreds of thousands of enslaved sub-Saharan Africans sent off to work in the Plantations. Yet, astonishingly, most British people are by and large completely unaware of the many horrors of their imperial history as it does not appear on any history curriculum taught in British schools. We cannot change what has happened in the past, but we can try to understand and to learn from past errors and to make sure the worst of them are not repeated. For as Edmund Burke, the greatest scourge of the East India Company rightly put it, "those who fail to learn from history are destined always to repeat it." (Dalrymple is the author of 'Return of a King' and co-writing a book on Kohinoor)</text>

	<text>Movies to Mahabharata, he's analysed them all S Anand's passion for computing drove his Chemical Engineering professors to distraction at IIT Madras, and when he moved on to IIM Bangalore, after a brief stint at IBM India, he was nicknamed "Stud" and alternatively, "Prof"  which as any alumnus will tell you  is one of the highest forms of praise that can be given to a batchmate. After graduating from IIM B, Anand moved on to jobs at the Boston Consulting Group and Infosys Consulting. In 2012, he was infected by the startup virus, and became chief data scientist at Gramener, which specializes in data visualization. Anand lives in Bangalore, where he uses text analytics to uncover the fact that it is Yudhishthira who is at the centre of Mahabaratha's plot, and not Arjuna, as one would imagine. Oh, and he also uses data science to understand his mobile bill. On becoming a data scientist ... It was an accidental mix of three of my personal interests  programming, statistics and design. It wasn't until 2009 that the term "data science" was coined. Until then, I knew I wanted a career that combined all three of my passions. Once I knew it had a name, the decision was obvious. What's the kind of work you do at Gramener? We're short circuiting the gap between gathering data and understanding data. We're work with all kinds of data. We work with aircraft flight paths, call data, court case results, fielding performances, poll forecasts, TV serial transcripts, even sex survey responses. But across these domains and types of data, there are common patterns of problems. Which are the biggest problem areas? What factors drive performance? What is the expected outcome? Fortunately, we have also discovered common patterns of analysis and visuals that answer these. Our work involves applying these patterns to any and every dataset. (File photo of Raam Nayakar) Best thing about your job ... Stumbling on strange patterns that tell a story. For example, when we discovered that 88 people at Modakkuruchi, TN, stood for elections but didn't even vote for themselves, it was a shock. Or when we found that children born in August score much more than children born in July. Or that people taking meter readings don't always visit the premises and cook up numbers that are typically multiples of 10. There are usually several insights hidden in data. For us, it's like exploring Alibaba's cave of treasures. What tools do you use? We use Python (a programming language) for most of our analysis. It's easy to learn, and easy to explore data with. R and Julia are quite popular as well. But Excel remains the primary method for data exploration in most organisations, and is quite effective. However, the tool is often less important than the scientist. A good scientist with a paper and pen will beat a moderate scientist with the best tool available today. How do you use data in daily life? Several of my day-to-day decisions are data-driven. What to eat? I scrape price and calorie information to pick cheap energy-rich foods. What to watch? I visualise the top-rated popular movies by genre from IMDb. When to book a flight? I review flight price trends, and typically book exactly 8 days before the flight. In many ways, my becoming a data scientist was driven by these inclinations. It's not because I'm a data scientist that I do this. It's because I have always done this that I'm a data scientist today. (As told to Narayanan Krishnaswami) Numbers have a story to tell Somewhat like endurance biking, data science is about staying power and enjoying the ride. Little wonder that Raam Nayakar, who is senior manager of marketing analytics and strategy at fashion e-retailer Myntra, follows one as a passion and the other as a profession. Sometimes the twain do meet when the 37-year-old uses his data orientation to find petrol stations and eating joints on remote biking routes. Best thing about the job It's a dynamic field. Finding new ways to analyse data keeps me on my toes. For instance, I recently learnt Python, an open-source analysis system in demand these days. Data analysis sometimes results in counter-intuitive insights, which is very exciting for us. For example, we once told an American wholesale retailer's credit card program to invert their loyalty rewards system and reward low spenders instead of the higher ones. We had identified the highest spenders as mostly re-sellers who did not need to be incentivized. This saved the company millions of dollars. What makes a good data scientist? A data scientist has to have a business context. We should be able to look at numbers, understand what they are telling us, and how that message can be converted into an actionable form. A good data scientist needs to have an eye for detail as well as the big picture. A typical day at work One day I am trying to find which TV channels drive better traffic for Myntra; another day I am engaged in text mining to rank social media responses for a contest we ran. It's the diversity of business problems that keeps my work interesting. Applying data science in daily life When I came back to Bangalore after a few years of living abroad, I was overwhelmed by the traffic. It would take me an hour and fifteen minutes to reach the Hosur Road office from my residence in JP Nagar. In the first month, I tried multiple routes at different timings, assessed areas of traffic congestion, and road conditions. In other words, I analysed the traffic data to construct a route that now takes me less than 45 minutes. Being a data oriented person, I don't miss out on details. My skills help me optimize time and effort even when I am not working. For example, if you want to get good properties to stay during your trips abroad  find out from which country do most of the tourists come from. Then make your booking from a local travel site in that country. I got two nights in a private villa in Bali when I booked from an Australian tour agent site. At the time, Australia contributed over 25% of tourists to Bali. Now, China has overtaken Australia. Is it going to stay a hot job? Many startups are now offering data science incubators and boot camps to train an army of data miners. Business analytics training institutes are offering courses, as are some of the IIMs. Big data is going to get even bigger. (As told to Shobita Dhar)</text>

	<text>Politics seems to power a whole lot of Indian netas who are well over their 70s. Some are star campaigners in the ongoing election battle, notching up half a dozen meetings a day in searing heat. So what keeps them sharp? A few days ago, former PM HD Deve Gowda walked half a kilometre in the summer sun, addressed a rally at noon and then went to meet Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala to talk about the problems in the newly-formed anti-corruption bureau. At Raj Bhavan, he was told the governor was having a siesta. An annoyed Gowda remarked: "Age must be the reason he needs to rest in the afternoon --though I don't think he is as old as me." Vala is 77; Gowda, 84. The neta who never tires or retires pointed out an essential fact of life  some of us slow down as the years catch on while others seem to go from strength to strength. Experts say that each of us ages at different rates, and multiple factors contribute to how we age. Some politicians in India, most of who anyway qualify to lead only when they cross 60, seem to be going strong well into their 90s. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which go to the polls next month, there are two 92-year-olds in the fray. During a recent check-up, physicians found that VS Achuthanandan, 92, who's gunning for the Kerala CM's seat, has a heart that's as healthy as that of a 30-year-old. Over the next few weeks, he'll be traversing most of the state by road, addressing up to five meetings a day. DMK chief M Karunanidhi, also 92, has been drawing up alliances, interviewing candidates and meeting party workers though he's been in a wheelchair since a spinal surgery in 2009. He has never lost an election since 1957 and will be contesting from and campaigning in Tiruvarur this time. Three-time Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, 79, is on the campaign trail every day. In 2011, Gogoi underwent a major heart surgery in Mumbai; this was just six months before the assembly election. He recovered in record time and led the party to a third consecutive victory. Of course these leaders stay active mentally and physically, and some are blessed with great genes, but they are also driven by the force of ambition. "Many people lose their sense of purpose once they retire. Politicians and businessmen have a strong sense of purpose even after 60 and that's what keeps them going," says V Sridhar, coordinator for dementia care at Chennai's Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF). A Bengaluru-based neuroscientist who did not wish to be named says that post-60 the body loses some of its flexibility and power of coordination; the brain's ability to handle multiple tasks declines as does short-term memory. Domain knowledge, however, plateaus after a point and does not decline with age. So it might be increasingly harder to use a new gadget or pick up a new skill, but one's expertise remains sound. And experience gives you an advantage over far younger rivals. This explains how politicians seem to up their game as they get older. "In the very old, the slight loss of cognitive function can be compensated for by increased wisdom. Thus, they can still make good decisions," explains David Gems, professor of biogerontology, Institute of Healthy Ageing, University College London. There is of course enormous variability between people in how they age, points out Gems. These differences seem to result from differences in lifestyle and environment  diet, exposure to pathogens and noxious agents like smog. Heredity also plays a role. The principle of 'use it or lose it' is very operative in cognitive skills: a high level of mental activity helps to keep the brain healthy. "There is also evidence that status affects lifelong health  having high status (i.e fewer bosses) seems to be good for long-term health," says Gems. That could explain how Gogoi, who needs support from his security personnel to climb stairs, is a transformed man when he's on the dais flaying Narendra Modi. Experts say the ageing of the brain and of the body are interlinked. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease and habits such as smoking hit the body and brain health, says the Bengaluru-based neuroscientist. It's a cycle, explains Chennai-based geriatrician V S Natarajan. "Remaining mentally active makes you physically active and vice-versa," he says. Karunanidhi says a daily practice of yoga is "the secret of his energy and success". Achuthanandan thrives on political adrenaline but also gets tetchy if he misses his 30-40 minute brisk morning walk. He normally wakes up at 4.30am, is out for his walk within an hour and then does a round of yoga. In poll season, he sometimes ends up missing his walk, especially when he is away from Thiruvananthapuram. "He is disappointed if he can't walk in the morning," says son V A Arunkumar. Family members believe that strict adherence to routine and a frugal diet keep him fit. Achuthanandan loves to walk along fields and beaches. But on the campaign trail, he makes do with courtyards of guest houses. Gogoi too never misses his morning walk and nightly physiotherapy session. And though he has a sweet tooth and loves fried cashewnuts, his wife keeps a hawk-eyed control on his diet.

	<text>400 years after his death, the Bard is universal, iconic and, most importantly alive, writes Indrajit Hazra Hona, ki nahin hona, yehi to mamla hain.' It's a line that Anurag Kashyap could easily have had Nawazuddin Siddiqui utter as Faizal Khan in a key scene in Gangs of Wasseypur. The line is primal, infused with depth, and comes with a dramatic oomph that sinks it into the deep end of the pop cultural pool. The way Amitabh's 'Mein aaj bhi pheke hue paise nahin uthata' from Zanjeer, or Amjad's 'Yeh haath humko de de, Thakur!' from Sholay, or Bogart's 'We'll always have Paris' does. And yet, there we have it. The iconic line in its original avatar uttered by a choleric member of the Danish royal family  'To be, or not to be, that is the question  was written by an Englishman some 400 years ago. Yes, it's in English. Yes, we associate it with school plays, school textbooks and, most harrowingly, with folks quoting lines from Shakespeare with the express purpose of telling us that they 'know their Shakespeare'. But behind all these lie acres of lines  dialogues, as they say in the industry  dealing with every aspect of the Human Condition: love, fear, guilt, lust, power, hurt, confusion, laughter, and variations thereof that Guru Dutts and Manmohan Desais have made a name and livelihood out of. Four hundred years since the death of William Shakespeare on April 23, 1616, he remains as universal as he remains iconic. But are his works alive for us here in 2016? Do they speak to us with the kind of force and accuracy that the most potent films do? And most importantly, are they meant to? Hell, yes, they are. Shakespeare, it is always good to remember, was working in the 16th century English equivalent of Hollywood/Bollywood. As an actor, writer and part-owner of the 'playing company', Lord Chamberlain's Men, he was the Salim-Javed-Quentin Tarantino of his time and space. He wrote plays not for your family edition of 'The Collected Works of Shakespeare'. He wrote plays for the box office the way SRK plays for it. He doled out bawdy slapstick the front-stallers  the raucous 'groundlings' at the Globe Theatre  philosophical enquiries for the more high-minded, tragedies that would make Devdas stay sober, comedies that would make Woody Allen less neurotic, and 'adult scenes' that one could only enjoy if you downloaded them. Romeo and Juliet was a trailblazing hit not because it was a damn fine romance. It was a super-hit because it turned the spotlight of a holds-barred love story and doused it in that other pop ingredient: the tearjerker tragedy that Salim and Anarkali in Mughal-e-Azam and every young couple negotiating with khap or family will immediately recognise at a stolen matinee rendezvous. And it is impossible for anyone not to recognise the corrosive power of power, and the mechanics of political powerplay, of PG-rated plays like Coriolanus, Richard III  and more fantastically in The Tempest and King Lear  in today's Golden Age of English-language television as one addictively follows shows like The House of Cards, The Game of Thrones, Madmen and The Sopranos. One can rattle off one iconic line after the other  lines that Shakespeare not only invented, but also lines with which he made inventions in the English language itself ('with bated breath', The Merchant of Venice; 'break the ice', The Taming of the Shrew; 'fancy-free', A Midsummer Night's Dream'; 'the green-eyed monster'; Othello, 'wild-goose chase' from Romeo and Juliet). But that is what Shakespeare has brought to one language: English. There is much more that his works hold, like deep shale waiting to be extracted and extricated out of the ivory towers occupied by Shakespeare-walas. There have been countless adaptations of Shakespeare's plays in every possible human language  and non-human too, if one considers Nick Nicholas' and Andrew Strader's Klingon adaptation of Hamlet, with the prince's soliloquy rendered perfectly in the opening line 'taH pagh taHbe'. But for the true force of Shakespeare to come through  in any language and whether rendered in movies, text, or on the stage  his drama has to be unfurled with all its sweat, swagger and, yes, item numbers. Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool and Omkara, the 2004 and 2006 adaptations of Macbeth and Othello set in gangland Mumbai and in the badlands of western Uttar Pradesh respectively, captured this Shakespearean essence. As did his 2014 rendition of Hamlet in Haider set in mid-90s Kashmir. (Rituparno Ghosh's Amitabh Bachchan-starring 2007 film, The Last Lear, was a stilted disaster.) Even 'Bollywood', with its genius for 'dialogues', is naturally inclined to the technicoloured and choreographed world of Shakespeare than the rarefied Shakesperean universe that many of us are more familiar with. It is our good fortune that there is no political entity desperate to appropriate the patron saint of human drama as 'one of their own', as is wont these days. But let it also be our good fortune that we do truly appropriate the works of Will Shakespeare from another language, country and time. If there is one culture that can dive naturally into his bubbling world of drama, melodrama, song and dance, violence, deceit, chaos, lust, disappointment, 'non-vegetarian' jokes.. it is ours. As the man would have said before his next Friday release, 'Readiness hi sab kuchh, bhai.' The Bard at the bar Henry IV "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown," said the Supreme Court in 2012, on then PM Manmohan Singh's position in the 2G spectrum case. Julius Caesar The Supreme Court quoted extensively from Caesar while striking down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which allowed authorities to jail anyone putting up online messages that were considered offensive. The judges drew from Mark Antony's speech to point out the difference between advocacy and incitement. Hamlet Commenting on an Allahabad High Court judgement and alluding to alleged corruption, former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju observed, "Something is rotten in the State of Denmark, said Shakespeare in Hamlet, and it can similarly be said something is rotten in the Allahabad High Court." Shakespeare in the house Hamlet In 2012, then FM Pranab Mukherjee quoted the line, "I must be cruel only to be kind," in his Budget speech to explain tough policy decisions taken for long-term economic gains. Macbeth "Fair is foul, and foul is fair," said HRD minister Smriti Irani during a debate on the JNU arrests and Rohith Vemula's suicide. She was accusing the opposition of twisting facts to suit their stance. Julius Caesar "There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune..." goes the original, but PM Narendra Modi was inspired by it and adapted it in his 2015 speech in the British Parliament to "We must seize the tide in the affairs of men, the world has sought the inspiration to act." Shakespeare as we like it Ahead of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, a look at how he inspired India. The Taming of the Shrew The first Shakespeare play staged in India in an Indian language was by a Parsi theatre group in Surat in 1852. The Gujarati adaptation of Taming was called 'Nathari firangan ne shi rite thekane aani' (How a bad-tempered European woman was tamed). The Merchant of Venice Bengal has had a long love affair with the bard. One of the earliest stage adaptations in Bengali was Bhanumati Chittavilas in 1853. MACBETH Utpal Dutt's Little Theatre Group worked extensively on Shakespeare. In the first phase the thespian simply staged classic Shakespeare in English. By 1970, he was freely experimenting, using jatra in his production of Macbeth. Barnam Van (1979) by writer Raghuvir Sahay was a completely desi spin on Macbeth. Brilliantly mounted at the NSD open-air theatre, it was directed by BV Karanth using elements of Indian folk and classical arts especially yakshagana. In 2012, a Bengali adaptation of Macbeth ruffled Mamata Banerjee's feathers because it had an unflattering reference to the TMC regime Director Vishal Bharadwaj's Maqbool (2003) had Mumbai's gritty underworld as backdrop. Probably, Bollywood's finest Shakespeare. Bhardwaj continued his love affair with Shakespeare in Omkara (Othello) and Haider (Hamlet). Hamlet Shakespeare entered Hindi cinema through Parsi theatre. Parsi actor Sohrab Modi played Hamlet in Khoon ka Khoon (1935), basically a filmed version of the play. The oldest surviving Indian Shakespeare movie dates to 1954. The Hindi Hamlet started veteran actor Kishore Sahu and an 18-year-old Mala Sinha played a strong-willed Ophelia. The Comedy of Errors Do Dooni Chaar (1968), the desi take on The Comedy of Errors scripted by Gulzar, flopped Gulzar adapted the script again for Angoor (1982) which turned out to be a crackling comedy. King Lear In 2011, Soumitra Chatterjee won rave reviews in Raja Lear. At London's Globe to Globe Festival in 1999, King Lear was staged in kathakali. The experiment was received with mixed reviews, with critics pointing out that the fusion left western audiences quite bewildered. Julius Caesar A controversial production of this play by Naseeruddin Shah and Vikram Kapadia took some radical liberties with the script. The criticism that followed provoked Shah to say that Shakespeare is "more revered in India than in his own country". Midsummer Night's Dream Called 'Kamdev ka apna, Basant ritu ka sapna', Habib Tanvir's adaptation used the nacha folk theatre form of Chhattisgarh. In 1997, director Mohan Maharishi turned it into Bagro basant hai with characters named Champa, Chameli and Sadaphuli. Odissi, Bharatanatyam, Chau movements and mudras were brought into the production. Othello Assamese actor Adil Hussain's Othello in Roysten Abel's A Play in Black and White (1999) is rated by critics among the best pieces of Shakespearean acting across the globe. Abel made the play a commentary on racism, linguistic discrimination and a host of contemporary issues. Kathakali Guru Sadanam Balakrishnan's interpretation of Othello was among the more successful experiments. In later productions, dancer Leela Samson joined him as Desdemona. Twelfth Night Atul Kumar's rollicking Hindi version Piya Beharoopiya (2012) was a runaway hit with its use of nautanki, folk and semi-classical music. Antony and Cleopatra In 2015, Kathakali artiste Prabal Gupta choreographed and played Cleopatra-The Last Pharaoh of Egypt in Kathakali last year in Bengaluru. The entire text of the play was translated from English to Sanskrit.</text>

	<text>No matter how horrific a crime, the accused deserves a defence counsel. But it is not a job for the faint-hearted, say lawyers who've represented some of the most hated figures in recent times "Everyone will hate me, but at least I'll lose," says American lawyer James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies, when asked to defend a Soviet spy. Having taken on this thankless, risky job, he does what any lawyer should do sincerely try to secure justice for his client. People often wonder what prompts lawyers to defend a seemingly "monstrous" or "indefensible" individual. Those questions are being asked again, as the Supreme Court appointed senior advocates Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde as amicus curiae in the Nirbhaya gangrape case that galvanized the nation. Though they already have lawyers, Ramachandran and Hegde have been asked to make sure that the four convicts on death row are given a "full and fair" hearing. Ramachandran, who has been amicus curiae for 26/11-accused Ajmal Kasab and has also represented Yakub Memon in the Supreme Court, is used to having his motives questioned. "When an accused is undefended, the court appoints a lawyer to defend him. To refuse to assist the court, when asked, is a dereliction of duty," he explains. When media and popular opinion demonize the accused, as they did with the Nirbhaya convicts or Kasab, it is a lawyer's job to make sure they get the full hearing they are owed. This is not an endorsement of rape or terrorism. As all first-year law students learn, the lawyer is not defending the crime, but due process. In our adversarial justice system, if you're hauled into court, you need counsel for a fair trial. "The accused has the right to assert his or her innocence by picking holes in the prosecution case. And it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Everything that can be said in favour of the accused needs to be said," says Ramachandran. Take the Kasab case. To a nation shocked by the CCTV footage of his rampage at Chhattrapati Shivaji Terminus, his guilt was clear as daylight. And yet, it had to be established by the court. It was hard to find a defence lawyer, and the few who came forward were threatened by political activists. In fact, the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Court's Bar Association unanimously resolved not to represent alleged terrorists. This is not an isolated incident. Bar associations often turn on lawyers who defend difficult clients. Anjali Waghmare, the first advocate appointed for Kasab, was dismissed immediately because of a clash of interests. Abbas Kazmi, who defended Kasab until November 2009  he was replaced by his assistant KP Pawar  had mounted a spirited defence. Pawar, too, had argued for leniency, saying that "the court should explore the possibility of Kasab's reform and rehabilitation. We have to consider that he is a young man who was brainwashed and blinded by an extremist organization". Kasab's death sentence, though, was upheld all the way until the President's final nod. "Defending the indefensible is not for the weak. It is not only the lawyer but his or her family that needs to be strong,'' says Kazmi. His family went through their own trial in those months, and required separate police protection. "I had three or four police guards at all times," he says. Friends and well-wishers used to express concern and anguish. "They'd ask: why are you risking your life?" recalls Kazmi. The same dilemma faced S Duraiswamy, who defended the accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case in June 1991, braving intimidation from Congress workers. "No other leading criminal lawyer would take up the case," he says. "The court was initially hostile, but as the trial progressed I was able to advance arguments with ease. In 1991 itself, I argued that the suspects could not be tried under TADA. Though the trial court rejected this line, in 1999 the Supreme Court came around and declared that TADA could not be invoked because it was not an act of terrorism." Some lawyers may have a personal code on the subject. "As a general rule I don't appear in rape cases as defence counsel," says senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani. But this is a deviation from the professional norm, which requires lawyers to take on anyone who needs counsel. "A lawyer is not meant to act as a judge before the trial is through," explains Ramachandran. Except for pressing personal reasons or conflicts of interest that make it difficult to push the client's case, an advocate has to follow what Ramachandran terms the "British cab rank rule". "A cab driver at Paddington station is bound to take any person who comes and offers the full fare, and so it is with lawyers," he says. There are several advocates of comparable standing who are asked to step in on controversial cases, not necessarily criminal ones. "Senior advocates have the duty to reinforce this from time to time by accepting such cases", says Ramachandran. It is, in fact, in the most emotionally charged cases, like that of Nirbhaya, that the rule of law must gird itself most strongly. Playing devil's advocate: * Ram Jethmalani defended Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, accused in the Indira Gandhi assassination case * Anand Grover is one of those who appeared for 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon * S Duraisamy, the sole counsel for all the 26 suspects in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case * Raju Ramachandran defended 26/11 accused Ajmal Kasab; is amicus curiae in Nirbhaya case</text>

	<text>Long queues for government-supplied water tankers are a common summer sight in most parts of Rajasthan. But in Laporiya, a village 80 km from Jaipur, a collective effort to harvest water by 350 families has been defying drought for the past 30 years. While ground water has gone down to 500 feet in nearby areas, it is found at 15-40 feet in this village. Not only does lush Laporiya have enough water for its population of nearly 2,000, it even supplies water to some 10-15 surrounding villages. This journey from scarcity to self-sufficiency started in 1977 when an 18-year-old Laxman Singh returned to his village only to find that it gripped by poverty, caste conflicts and malnourishment. The school dropout realized that the only way to stop this vicious cycle of misfortune was to make the area agriculturally prosperous. But water was a big problem  it was available at a depth of 100 feet. "Back then, there were hardly any means to pump out water at such a depth. I decided that if we cannot go down, the water has to come up," said Singh. He then devised the chowka system based on a traditional method of water harvesting in Rajasthan and founded the non-profit organization Gram Vikas Navyuvak Mandal Laporiya (GVNML). Under the chowka system, small, interconnected, sloping rectangular pits, nine inches deep, are made in pasture land. The pits are bordered with bunds (mud embankment). As water assembles in one chowka it flows into an adjacent chowka and then spreads evenly because of the bunds. After crossing several such chowkas, water finally moves into a pond. This method of preserving rainwater makes the top layer of soil moist, recharges ground water, and also enables growth of native grasses and shrubs. Over 15 years, the chowka system was developed on about 400 bighas of pasture land. The villagers came together and contributed money and labour to make the bunds. With the soil gaining moisture, villagers were able to harvest their rabi crop without irrigating their fields. "As there is no withdrawal of ground water for the rabi crop, it gets recharged and is used during summers," said Chotu Singh, a farmer. There's been some smart crop planning too. Villagers stay away from water-intensive crops. During summer, cultivation of only green fodder and vegetables is allowed and that too in fields that are close to the well. The discipline reaped some additional benefits. As the pasture land got green, animals started getting enough fodder. An indigenous breed of cow (Gir) was brought from Gujarat and dairy farming was promoted. Gir produces 8-10 litres of milk in a day and each house now has at least two of them. "Each household makes about Rs 30,000  45,000 a month by selling milk. It's more for those who have over five cows," said Arjun Singh, a volunteer of GVNML. The example has now been followed by 58 neighboring villages and is now spreading to other districts. How they did it: * Adopted traditional water harvesting system * Stayed away from water-intensive crops</text>

	<text>In parched Bundelkhand in Madhya Pradesh, villagers in Dargai Khurd and Gour have devised clever ways to recycle water  they bathe on coir cots and place a vessel beneath to collect the water draining down. This will later be used to wash clothes and utensils. Six kilometres farther down in Gayajeetpura, a bath can thankfully still be had without resorting to such extreme economy. This village of 700 in Tikamgarh  the worst drought-affected district in the region  has managed to steer clear of troubled waters by reforming its farming practices. Up until three years ago, the village grew water-guzzling wheat and soyabean like its neighbours and found its yield dropping along with the water level of the local 13th century Chandela-era Kumhedi lake, which was down to 10 feet of water. While the advantageous location of the village  in the downstream of the lake  ensured that it was not as deprived as nearby villages, its depleting water table also served as a caution. After all, 900 water bodies built by the Chandela rulers between the 10th and 13th century are now bone-dry in the region. So three years ago, Gayajeetpura acted on the advice of a non-profit and replaced a part of their crop share with organic horticulture. "It's how we managed to face Tikamgarh's third successive drought," says Rajendra Prasad, a Dalit farmer, who has been sowing vegetables for the last two years on part of his 3-acre plot. While the fields of neighbouring Mohangarh tehsil are scorched, Prasad's fields, along with those of 20 other farmers in Gayajeetpura, are lush green. "We have not only shifted partially from wheat and soyabean to vegetables and fruit like papaya, but we've also started optimizing our use of water," he says. The farmers here have created small slopes on their fields and planted vegetables in close rows on these slopes so that water trickles down and covers a wider area. Nandram, another farmer, grows papaya, tomato, onion, chilli, lady finger and cucumber and earns between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 a week at the weekly market. How they did it: * Shifted to organic horticulture which fetches higher prices * Adopted contour farming on slopes to conserve water</text>

	<text>All-male panels may soon be a thing of the past. Now, feminists are calling out organisers who turn the dais into a manference Over a year ago David Hasselhoff, the alpha male once-lifeguard from Baywatch, found himself a new (uninvited) career as the mascot of the 'manel' - the all-male panel. He appeared on a Tumblr called All Male Panels, started in Feb last year by Finnish feminist researcher Dr Saara Sarma. The Tumblr wanted to highlight the gender lopsidedness of discussion panels and other high altars of expertise and experience, like say, state cabinets and boardrooms. Sarma invited people to send in flyers or pictures of all-male events and seminars, which received Hasselhoff's virile stamp of approval: 'Congrats, you have an all male panel!' The manel is being named and shamed worldwide, with memes, online petitions, boycotts and even spoken word poetry slamming it. 'Group thinking turns into brain shrinking; humans seeking meaning and development, male-only panels are such an embarrassment' raps Sofie Sandell, professional speaker and digital leader on YouTube. In India too, the stew's beginning to simmer. Last year, Sairee Chahal, founder of Sheroes and Fleximoms  career communities for women  was invited to a top tech conference in Bangalore. "It has typically been a bro affair, but the organisers wanted to do an all-women panel for the first time, alongside their regular all-male sessions, Chahal recalls, "They had no context for the panel - the organisers asked me to identify women panelists and a suitable subject. We didn't do it eventually because the four other women I'd approached from tech felt there was no purpose to the panel." Companies and conference organisers who are inviting a lone woman to a male-heavy dais simply to avoid the label of sexism are now being called out. Ashwini Asokan, co-founder and CEO of the Artificial Intelligence company, Mad Street Den, has been challenging sexism in the tech industry and got trolled for it. In fact, sexist putdowns are often what hold women back from taking the stage. "Several women started conversations on Twitter saying they lacked the confidence because of bullies and trolls," says Asokan. She points out that India has more female engineering and computer science graduates than most countries (30- 40% of college seats), giving the lie to the specious claim that suitable women experts simply cannot be found. "It's why I pick up the phone, find them and push them to these panels," Asokan says. To counter the old boys clubs that conferences and seminars have become, Asokan suggests that women create their own networks. "I was one of the biggest promoters of the Grace Hopper (Celebration of Women in Computing) conferences," she says, "I believe women-only events are a great training field; if you're shy to get up on a mixed gender panel and get bullied, here's where you start. Hopefully, in a few years we won't need women-only conferences at all." Several women's organisations globally are building databases of women leaders and experts (a woman can nominate herself). Some like the UK-based Her Say and The Women's Room are also shoring up female experts across disciplines who can comment in the media (only 24% of women are heard, seen or read about in traditional media globally, revealed the Global Media Monitoring Project 2015). ElsaMarie D'Silva, MD and co-founder of Red Dot Foundation, and her colleague, the Kenya-born Esther Ngumbi are assembling a crowd-sourced directory of women experts from around the world; they've got 500 profiles from 45 countries so far. "Filling panel spots with known names (often men) is easy. How can one discuss a topic of any importance without considering the views of 50% of the population?" says D'Silva, a resident of Mumbai. So far two international organisers in Australia and Shanghai have already reached out to them. Phase two will put those profiles on a map with the public listings. D'Silva and Ngumbi recently wrote a blog post on GoodMenProject.com, appealing to men to also weigh in on the debate. In January, in a domino effect, three leading comics artists withdrew from the lifetime achievement award shortlist of a major comic-books festival in France because it was all-male, prompting several others to bow out as well in protest. In Australia earlier this month five male 'star' speakers pledged to boycott panels that weren't gender-diverse. Quartz also featured Sree Sreenivasan, the chief digital officer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as one of those pledging to give all-male panels a miss. But a panel is only one Tetris block; it needs to fit in with others to move the bar. An organization that doesn't channel more women into leadership roles would have accomplished nothing more than window dressing by asking a woman to a panel. "Women don't crave patriarchal pats on the back; they deserve equal participation in public life. Their voices need to be respected and actioned. Women who speak up in public fora are called 'aggressive', 'militant', 'trouble-makers' and worse," says columnist Shobhaa De, who for years has occupied a place at the conference table. "I make sure I am heard loudly and clearly when I sign up for these panels. I turn the 'feeble' questions around when required. If it's an important enough panel discussion, I don't care if I am there as a 'token woman'  I make sure I have my say regardless." Dictionary for dudes: Mansplaining: When a man explains something to a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing. Or as Urban Dictionary puts it: telling a woman she's wrong, even when she actually is Manspreading: When a man sits with his legs wide apart, invading the space of the occupant next to him. However, as UB points out, when women set large purses and shopping bags next to them and take up another seat, it goes unnoticed and is generally dismissed Manslamming: When a man slams into a woman while walking because he won't alter his course Manterrupting: The unnecessary interruption of a woman by a man, often in the workplace Bropriate: When a man appropriates a woman's ideas and passes them off as his own</text>

	<text>In his latest work, The Gene, an Intimate History, Pulitzer-winning author and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee examines the role of heredity in our lives On October 6, 1942, five years before my father's family left Barisal, my mother was born twice in Delhi. Bulu, her identical twin, came before her, placid and beautiful. My mother, Tulu, emerged several minutes later, squirming and crying murderously. The midwife must, fortunately, have known enough about infants to recognize that the most beautiful are often the most damned: the quiet twin, on the edge of listlessness, was quite severely undernourished and had to be swaddled in blankets and revived. The first few days of my aunt's life were the most tenuous. She could not suckle at the breast, the story runs (perhaps apocryphally), and there were no infant bottles to be found in Delhi in the forties, so she was fed through a cotton wick dipped in milk, and then from the caul of a cowrie shell shaped like a spoon. A nurse was hired to tend to her. When the breast milk began to run dry at seven months, my mother was quickly weaned to let her sister have its last remnants. Right from the onset, then, my mother and her twin were living experiments in genetics  emphatically identical in nature and emphatically divergent in nurture. My mother  the "younger" of the two by minutes  was boisterous. She had a slippery, mercurial temper. She was carefree and fearless, fast to learn and willing to make mistakes. Bulu was physically timid. Her mind was more agile, her tongue sharper, her wit more lancing. Tulu was gregarious. She made friends easily. She was impervious to insults. Bulu was reserved and restrained, quieter and more brittle. Tulu liked theater and dancing. Bulu was a poet, a writer, a dreamer. Yet the contrasts only highlighted the similarities. Tulu and Bulu looked strikingly similar: they had the same freckled skin, almond-shaped face, and high cheekbones, unusual among Bengalis, and the slight downward tilt of the outer edge of the eye, the trick that Italian painters used to make Madonnas seem to exude a mysterious empathy. They shared the inner language that twins often share. They had jokes that only the other twin understood. Over the years, their lives drifted apart. Tulu married my father in 1965 (he had moved to Delhi three years earlier). It was an arranged marriage, but also a risky one. My father was a penniless immigrant in a new city, saddled with a domineering mother and a half-mad brother who lived at home. To my mother's overly genteel West Bengali relatives, my father's family was the very embodiment of East Bengali hickness: when his brothers sat down to lunch, they would pile their rice in mounds and punch volcanic holes in it for gravy, as if marking the insatiable, perpetual hunger of their village days in the form of craters on their plates. Bulu's marriage seemed a vastly safer prospect by comparison. In 1966, she was engaged to a young lawyer, the eldest son of a well-established clan in Calcutta. In 1967, Bulu married him and moved to his family's sprawling, decrepit mansion in South Calcutta, with a garden already choked by weeds. By the time I was born, in 1970, the sisters' fortunes had started to move in unexpected directions. In the late 1960s, Calcutta began its steady descent into hell. Its economy was fraying, its tenuous infrastructure heaving under the weight of waves of immigration. Internecine political movements broke out frequently, shuttering the streets and businesses for weeks. As the city convulsed between cycles of violence and apathy, Bulu's new family hemorrhaged its savings to keep itself afloat. Her husband kept up the pretense of a job, leaving home every morning with the requisite briefcase and tiffin box  but who needed a lawyer in a city without laws? Eventually, the family sold the mildewing house, and moved into a modest two-room flat  just a few miles from the house that had sheltered my grandmother on her first night in Calcutta. My father's fate, in contrast, mirrored that of his adoptive city. Delhi, the capital, was India's overnourished child. Bolstered by the nation's aspirations to build a mega-metropolis, fattened by subsidies and grants, its roads widened and its economy expanded. My father rose through the ranks of a Japanese multinational firm, clambering swiftly from lower-to upper-middle class. We vacationed in Europe. We learned to eat with chopsticks and swam in hotel pools in the summer. When the monsoons hit Calcutta, the mounds of garbage on the streets clogged the drains and turned the city into a vast infested swamp. One such stagnant pond, festering with mosquitoes, was deposited yearly outside Bulu's house. She called it her own "swimming pool." There is something in that comment  a lightness  that was symptomatic. You might imagine that the sharp vicissitudes of fortune had reshaped Tulu and Bulu in drastically different ways. On the contrary: over the years, their physical resemblance had dwindled to the point of vanishing, but something ineffable about them  an approach, a temperament  remained remarkably similar and even amplified in its convergence. Despite the growing economic rift between the two sisters, they shared an optimism about the world, a curiosity, a sense of humor, an equanimity that borders on nobility but comes with no pride. When we traveled abroad, my mother would bring home a collection of souvenirs for Bulua wooden toy from Belgium, fruit-flavored chewing gum from America that smelled of no earthly fruit, or a glass trinket from Switzerland. My aunt would read travel guides of the countries that we had visited. "I've been there too," she would say, arranging the souvenirs in a glass case, with no trace of bitterness in her voice. There is no word, or phrase, in the English language for that moment in a son's consciousness when he begins to understand his mother  not just superficially, but with the immersive clarity with which he understands himself. My experience of this moment, somewhere in the depths of my childhood, was perfectly dual: as I understood my mother, I also learned to understand her twin. I knew, with luminous certainty, when she would laugh, what made her feel slighted, what would animate her, or where her sympathies or affinities might lie. To see the world through the eyes of my mother was to also see it through the eyes of her twin, except, perhaps, with lenses tinted in slightly different colors. What had converged between my mother and her sister, I began to realize, was not personality but its tendency  its first derivative, to borrow a mathematical term. In calculus, the first derivative of a point is not its position in space, but its propensity to change its position; not where an object is, but how it moves in space and time. This shared quality, unfathomable to some, and yet self-evident to a four-year-old, was the lasting link between my mother and her twin. Tulu and Bulu were no longer recognizably identical  but they shared the first derivative of identity.

	<text>In the sixties, it was hard for a brown man to find a room to let, writes Farrukh Dhondy. Today, Asian fans are donning City's blue and white colours and cheering the club Tom Hanks, superstar, placed a ten pound bet some months ago on a football team called Leicester City. The bookies were at that time offering odds of 1 to 5,000 against them winning the Premier League title. Last week Hanks collected half a million pounds Sterling. The dust hasn't settled yet on Leicester City's unpredicted and spectacular victory. Writers, politicians and other Toms, not to mention Dicks and Harriets are now claiming to be the club's supporters. Julian Barnes, Booker-prize winning novelist, was given space on the front page of the Guardian newspaper to boast about his residence in Leicester and allegiance to the city's football team. Alistair Campbell, Tony Blair's notorious press handler and spin-doctor, wrote a piece saying he was present at the club's final game and was patronisingly pleased to see the spectator stands filled with Asian faces. I too once lived in Leicester. I was at the time writing a post-graduate thesis on Rudyard Kipling at Leicester University and before I enrolled I took the train up from London to find myself a room to live in. This was in 1968 and I did the obvious thing  I went to estate agents who sent me to houses where there were single rooms to let. I must have gone to three or four of these, rung the bell, only to be told that the accommodation had, unfortunately, just been let. Farrukh Dhondy After the third or fourth such rebuttal, I deduced that there was a possibility that the renters didn't like my face or race. I went back to the estate agent in something of a rage and placed my accusation against their clients in as respectful a way as I could. They said they couldn't help. As I walked out of the agent's office I was followed down the street by a secretary from the office. She had overheard the conversation and was sympathetic. She said the only advice she could give me was to go to the 'Asian area' of the city and look for notice boards advertising rooms to let. I asked her where these Asian areas were and she directed me to Narborough Road. I found such a notice board and after one or two phone calls found a room and put a deposit down. At the time the area was populated by Punjabis, mostly Indian and some Pakistani. It was the year of mass migration of Asians from Kenya and later, under the compulsion of Idi Amin's regime, from Uganda. For some reason, a large number of these immigrants, mostly of Gujarati origin, came to Leicester. Over the decades the city became one of the hubs of Asian migration and today it is a multiracial, multicultural city and has elected as its MP, one Keith Vaz, an Indian Christian. The city has, since I was there, changed in very many ways. It now boasts several theatres which put on serious and frivolous Asian entertainment. Highfields, one of the central areas of the city, with ageing Victorian housing stock was settled by mainly Pakistani immigrants. It used to be the red light district and in the eighties the Muslim community made a well-publicised and understandable move to clear the streets of sex-workers. The prostitutes formed a loose union and fought back, asserting the fact that they were there before the Asians came and besides a major part of their clientele was from the community that opposed them. The dispute was settled by a compromise  the girls wouldn't solicit on the streets. In the days when I was turned away on the doorstep while looking for a room, I would in London or Leicester stay away from the streets on the days when a football match was scheduled. British football fans were notorious for their rowdiness and racism and when moving about in gangs singing and shouting raucously were an intimidating lot. I wasn't anywhere near mobs of Leicester fans, known affectionately as 'Foxes', when they celebrated their victory but every TV channel and news report featured the events, outside the stadium and in the streets of the city. It was unusual to see so many Asian fans wearing Leicester's blue and white coloured shirts, shouting slogans, singing silly songs and wrapping themselves in Leicester city scarves. During Margaret Thatcher's Prime Ministership, her lieutenant, Norman Tebbit formulated what became known as the 'Tebbit test' for immigrants: when Britain was playing Pakistan, India or the West Indies at cricket, which team did the British immigrant support? Leicester City is unlikely to be pitted against an Indian or Pakistani football team in the near future, but if it is, its fans, all its fans, will, it's certain pass a modified Tebbit test as true Foxes. City Guide You know Leicester City won the Premier League against staggering odds. But there's more to the place than football First of all, it's 'Lester' not 'Lay-ces-ter' It has the highest number of British Indians in the UK  28.3% of the population of 3,29,000. No wonder, their Diwali celebrations are the biggest outside India Only 50.6% of the population identifies as white, according to the 2011 census It is home to the first Jain temple established in the West It is also home to David Atttenborough and his son Richard And it's the resting place of Richard III</text>

	<text>The MP town rings with the legend of a 19th-century wolf boy whose tale inspired Kipling. Sunday Times goes searching in the jungle of The Jungle Book In Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, Mowgli the man-cub is said to be reared in 'Seeonee hills' by a pack of wolves. Now a burgeoning township in Madhya Pradesh, replete with schools, banks and markets, present-day Seoni bears no semblance of a jungle. Around 122 years ago when the book first came out, it's said the area was part of one big forest. That has now been reduced to the Kanha and Pench sanctuaries connected by a fast-depleting forest corridor. While Kipling's was a work of fiction, it's said to have been inspired by Sir William Henry Sleeman's pamphlet, An Account of Wolves Nurturing Children in Their Dens, which describes a wolf-boy captured near Seoni in 1831. Sleeman was a British soldier and administrator and is known for his work in suppressing thuggery. We found a mention of the wolf-boy named 'Seeall' in Mervyn Smith's Sport and Adventure in the Indian Jungle, which describes his capture and behaviour in captivity. "I have reason to believe that he was the original of Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli," the author writes. It is an intriguing story, one that inspires a trek to Mowgli-land, made even more famous by Disney's latest take on the classic. While Mowgli is a pervasive theme in the district  from his caricatures on bus stands, to an annual Mowgli Mahotsav and even a dedicated statue at the collector's office, few know of the wolf-boy's legend. The only clue is talk about a cave on the outskirts of Kanhiwada, a village that finds mention in the original tale. Sure enough, 3km from Kanhiwada, in a village called Chhui, there's an inconspicuous forest department board that points towards "Amodagadh, the karmasthali of the wolf-child Mowgli". "I have driven past this point numerous times in the last five years. Never have I noticed it before," says Shourabh Ghosh, co-founder of Kohka wilderness camp. Twelve kilometres of dirt track lie ahead. No wonder nobody bothers to find this "tourist spot". The track twists and turns amid fields, and ends up running straight into the forest corridor. The search now feels like a Hardy Boys' unravelling of a mystery shrouded in urban legend. The road poetically ends in a fork. The path to the right, leads to the top of a hillock. A closer inspection reveals the jungle in The Jungle Book. "A hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide," Kipling wrote. We've reached Council Rock  the meeting place of the wolf pack that adopted Mowgli. In the Jon Favreau film, Neel Sethi is not considered 'wolf' enough to join the meetings though he tries hard to be as fast and agile as the other cubs. Looking down from the spot where Akela held court, the Wainganga seems to split the mountain in two. Smooth rocks  some the size of cars  dot the ravine trapped between two almost-vertical cliff walls. Look closely, and one can see why Shere Khan couldn't escape the buffalo herd led by Mowgli that trampled him to death (in the book). This could be the gorge where it all ended. Could it also be the real wolf boy's den? Local legend says so, and PRO of Seoni, Babita Mishra, agrees fervently. "That's the spot where Mowgli was captured," she says, referring to the 1831 incident. Why wasn't it developed as a tourist spot then? There was a plan but it got caught in red tape, she says. Although Kipling never visited Seoni, his book borrowed heavily from Robert Armitage Strendale's books Seonee, Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, and Denizens of the Jungle. Subharanjan Sen, field director of Pench tiger reserve, believes the Amodagadh story is pure conjecture. In the book, Mowgli may have been the target of Shere Khan, but today the tigers of Pench are the ones in danger. Ten tiger deaths have been reported in the past eight months, the last one as recent as March-end when a tigress and her two cubs were found poisoned to death. "Karakal has almost disappeared from this area; about 50 wild buffaloes must be left in surrounding areas; a concerted effort has helped Barasingha numbers pick up in Kanha since the 1960s, when they stooped to a mere 65," says Sen. Moreover, the corridor is thinning. A comparison of forest cover maps from a 1913-26 survey and recent years shows clear signs of deforestation, especially significant around the western edge of Kanha national park. We head back to the fork and take the left this time, 45 gigantic stone steps down to the river bank. Questions about Mowgli's den to the handful of people bathing there draw blanks. "But there is a cave of a Batekhari Baba here," says a fisherman. The famed Mowgli cave is now occupied by a self-proclaimed godman, who has covered the cliff walls with his preachings. He's been meditating there since 1977, the graffiti declares. Dressed in allblack, a white mask and dark shades, this ascetic is keen to tell stories of his chardham yatra on foot, but the moment I ask him about the wolf boy, his 'inner peace' disappears. The choicest of expletives are used to describe Kipling's saga. "There never was a Mowgli," he spits. Whatever the baba's view, somewhere down the river bend, the legend of Mowgli rustles on the jungle floor.</text>

	<text>The revolutionary is fast turning into an urban pop culture icon with his face on everything from bags and bric-a-brac to mugs and mobile covers. Capitalism Zindabad! Ravi Shekhar, a 19-year-old undergrad at Delhi University with a swagger and sideburns, recently picked up some Bhagat Singh merchandise online  a screen-printed T-shirt and a backpack. Of course he knows who Singh is but no, he didn't know he was recently in the news. "What for?" he asks. "He was called a 'revolutionary terrorist'? Cool." About a week ago Shekhar's alma mater stopped the sale and distribution of the Hindi edition of historian Bipan Chandra's book India's Struggle for Independence, capitulating to ABVP protests over the book's references to Bhagat Singh as a revolutionary terrorist. Whether or not the rest of the country's 18-35-year-olds approve of, or even know of the disputed description, the protagonist himself has their unequivocal vote. For young hipsters, Singh is a desi daredevil, a rebel with a cause, a man of the hour. Literally. He gazes out from watches and wall clocks, but he's also on mugs, wallets, cushions, laptop skins, key-chains, lamps, mobile covers and even wall decals, bearing either of the two versions of his iconic image  turbaned or hatted. The more abstract art pictures him in fractals, or simply with the legend 'Shaheed' or 'Inquilab Zindabad' and a grim noose; some only feature a waxed moustache, shorthand like Gandhi's wire-rim glasses. The universe of Bhagat Singh merchandise on e-commerce sites has exploded in the last year or two, generating new product forms every month. "I come from Punjab, where Bhagat Singh is very popular, so I thought people elsewhere would love him too. I believe his rebelliousness appeals to young people," says Puneet Gupta, co-founder of the merchandise e-store Poster Guy, which retails goods printed with graphic art sourced from designers across the country. Their 'Bhagat Singh' range debuted around Independence Day last year. Raj Kiran Singh, 32, is banking on this home-grown hero-worship. The founder of the bobble and figurine company India Bobbles developed a 5-inch epoxy resin action figure, brandishing a pistol (presumably a stance from his storming of the Central Assembly). On the pedestal is the legend 'Purna Swaraj'. "Sales haven't been good," he admits, "Of the 250 figurines we produced, 100 are still unsold, but that's probably because we overpriced them at Rs 899." The entrepreneur hasn't given up  a bobble head of Bhagat Singh is next. Gupta hopes to build brand Bhagat. "People here wear Che Guevara, but they don't know him; he's just a fashion statement. We're trying to make Bhagat Singh the new Che for Indians." As with anti-capitalist Che, the irony of branding Marxist Bhagat is stark. The global journey of Argentine icon-turned-logo Che Guevara, from Cuban political symbolism (his image was first used by Castro in 1967), to student radicalism (by French student activists in 1968), to mute marketer of everything from condoms to kerchiefs, is a study in the protean power of the icon. Che's classic image was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda in 1960 at a state funeral. Bhagat's famous hatted picture was shot on April 3 1929, at Ram Nath Photographers, at Kashmiri Gate, Delhi. It was meant to solidify his image as a secularist, and disseminated to the press after the April 8 assembly bombing. In India, Gandhi has always been the nation's default national icon  a mutable symbol of freedom, native industry, nationalism and non-violence  deployed by politicians of all stripes, socialists and capitalists hawking sentimentalism. While Bhagat Singh appears to have only recently crossed the threshold of urban pop culture. Professor Y S Alone, who teaches visual studies at JNU's School of Arts and Aesthetics, recalls post-Independence wall calendars that figured the 23-year-old, sometimes in the company of co-conspirators and fellow martyrs Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar. Though Gandhi didn't approve of their anarchy, he too was corralled into the calendars along with the triumvirate. "Post '95 Bhagat Singh returned to prominence because of his political appropriation by the BJP. The commoditisation of a hero is the consequence of his political appropriation," Alone goes on to say. After the Vajpayee government folded in 2004, Bhagat Singh was back on the shelf, only to be dusted down in 2014, when he was hailed as a 'desh bhakt' and 'virat purush' by the campaigning BJP. But do youth shoulder this 'virat purush' on their sleek slingbags as a symbol of patriotism, machismo or vague rebellion? "I hope the image means pride and resistance, but not empty nationalism," ventures Professor Aditya Mukherjee, co-author of the embattled Hindi reader, Bharat ka Swatantrata Sangharsh. "But resistance to what? For Bhagat Singh, it was resistance to imperialism and capitalism. We've seen Ram, who is supposed to be brave and truthful, being used to instigate communal killings. I shudder to think to what ends Bhagat Singh can be employed." Having said that, the academic would rather see Indian hipsters flaunt Singh than Elvis Presley. "It's a small but good step; it shows our youth can count Indian revolutionaries among their heroes, not just American celebrities." The Bhagat Singh you didn't know The only Bhagat Singh India knows is the anti-imperialist revolutionary, but few are aware he had a namesake on another continent. While one Bhagat fought to rid his country of a foreign hand, the other struggled to be naturalized in a foreign land. Bhagat Singh Thind was the older of the two by 15 years. He was born in Amritsar but travelled to America in 1913 to pursue higher studies. Five years later he was recruited by the US Army to fight in World War I, and was even promoted to acting sergeant. In 1918 he applied to the US government for citizenship, which technically only 'free white persons' and those of African descent could apply for. However, several high caste, light-skinned immigrants managed to bypass this because of their skin colour. Thind too was granted citizenship, but it was rescinded four days later. He made two more attempts  in 1923 the matter even reached the Supreme Court, which ruled against him  until his last attempt bore fruit in New York. This March, the Asian-American theatre group, East West Players, staged a play based on Bhagat Singh Thind in schools and libraries in LA. "Part of my fascination with Thind came from the fact that he actually does not occupy a place of prominence in the Indian diaspora," says Mayank Keshaviah, the playwright, "So I felt as if I were uncovering a hidden gem of a story."</text>

	<text>Mansur Ali has spent his life in a border enclave in Cooch Behar. Avijit Ghosh meets the 77-year-old who says he is going to feel like 18 when he gets inked on May 5 Mohammad Mansur Ali Miah has spent his entire life in Poaturkuthi, a quiet village on the edge of Cooch Behar in north Bengal. And yet, the shifts in the sub-continent's geo-politics meant that his country kept changing. He was born in pre-Independence India, grew up in East Pakistan and turned into a senior citizen in Bangladesh. And last July, when India and Bangladesh exchanged enclaves, he became an Indian citizen again. On May 5, Mansur Ali  that's his shorter name on the Aadhar card  will stamp the ballot paper for the first time in his life. "I am 77, but that day I will be just 18," jokes Ali, a community leader. A lifetime in a chitmahal (enclave) means living in one country and being surrounded by another. It's a life of denial and desperation but Ali is not bitter about the cruel punches life threw at him. Ali was born in a family of landowners in 1939. "My grandfather had 39 bighas of land laden with mango trees," he recalls. He went a school in nearby Lauchapra village. Then Partition happened. "There was looting for weeks," Ali says. After Partition, Poaturkuthi became a part of East Pakistan surrounded by Indian villages. He couldn't go to Lauchapra anymore. For some years, he studied in a mediocre local school. "Then my family created a fake address, gave me a fake name and got me admitted to Choudhuryhaat High School on the Indian side in 1956. When I completed matriculation, a teacher offered me a job in a hospital with a monthly salary of Rs 100. But I refused though I knew that my Indian degree was not valid in Dhaka." Like all enclaves, Poaturkuthi was ignored by the state: no development, no electricity and no police. "We were sitting ducks for miscreants," says Ali. In 1966, his father was shot at during a dacoity at his house. Ali recalls getting a taxi and with the help of relatives from across the border, taking his father to MJN hospital in Cooch Behar. "The doctor looked at him and asked, 'Are you a dacoit?' My father replied, 'No. I am from the other side of the border.' He was arrested. But he was also treated for his wounds. Police stood guard outside his ward as he recovered. Later he was produced in court. He was asked to either pay a fine of Rs 5 or spend a week in jail. "But a customs officer helped us out. If this had happened today, my father might have had to spend months in jail. But after that, cross-border interactions became infrequent," says Ali. There was much bonhomie on both sides of the border when Bangladesh was born in 1971, especially because Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were on great terms. When the India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement was signed in 1974, enclave-dwellers hoped their problems would be solved. "But Mujib was killed in 1975 and Indira, in 1984. The issue went into cold storage. Those were hard times. We were often accosted and blackmailed at bazaars and haats if we went to the other side for some work or shopping. Many trespassers were caught and jailed," he says. In 1994, the Bharat-Bangladesh Enclave Exchange Coordination Committee (BBEECC) was formed. There was slow progress on the political and diplomatic fronts too. Finally, last year the two states agreed to an exchange of enclaves. In all, 111 enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi ones in India, involving about 37,000 people, were ready for the swap. On the midnight of July 31, last year, life came full circle for thousands like Ali. He was born in undivided India under British rule and now, he was an Indian citizen again. "The whole village was awake all night  what we experienced cannot be described in words," says Ali, who has six sons and a daughter. Now everyone is waiting for May 5, the day Dinhata constituency, of which Poaturkuthi is a part, goes to vote in the ongoing West Bengal assembly elections. Forward Bloc and Trinamool are strong contenders. But the BJP flag also flutters in this Muslim-dominated village. Like other enclaves, Poaturkuthi was promised a financial package. And, of course, electricity. "We waited 68 years for freedom. Now we are waiting for development and power," says Ali.</text>

	<text>They were once boys from the 'naka' rapping about their city from its chawls and gullies. Now, Divine and Naezy are stars with their songs about politics and poverty making waves at home and abroad Divine aka Vivian Fernandes once played 'fillers' at college shows. Today, besides a major label contract, he has a viral video Jungli Sher with over a million views, and packed shows in London. The 25-year-old, who still lives in the slums of Andheri's JB Nagar, also made history as the first Indian rapper  he rapped freestyle in Hindi  for BBC 1 radio show host and rapper Charlie Sloth's iconic 'Fire in the Booth' series. Then there's Naved Sheikh, who at 13, was transformed by Sean Paul's Temperature when he first heard it spun by a DJ in his Kurla chawl. He went to a cybercafe the next day, printed out the lyrics and memorised them. In 2014 as a 22-year-old, Naved's alter-ego Naezy unleashed his frustration in a DIY video  Aafat  that was shot on zero budget on an iPad. Aafat has since racked up more than 4.7 lakh views on YouTube. It made Naezy the subject of the documentary Bombay 70 and got him a deal from Only Much Louder, India's biggest alternative culture promoter and management agency. His latest video, Haq Hai, has ratcheted over 30,000 views in just over a week. These two rappers and their rap-to-riches stories are also the inspiration for Zoya Akhtar's next project, Gully Boy that (if whispers) are to be believed, will feature Ranveer Singh as a rapper. It will have Naezy collaborate on lyrics with poet and lyricist Gulzar. Nothing confirms the entry of a subculture into the mainstream like a big Bollywood production. But how did these two young men, who rap in Bombaiya, tapori style, catch the nation's ears? The slums and chawls of Mumbai have always been a fertile ground for bhasha (language) rap, a style adapted from American rap but Indianised, that found a willing community online. But Naezy and Divine  who collaborated on the 2015 hit, Mere gully mein  told an authentic and original story that people have identified with all over the country. File photo of Naezy. "Mere gully mein represented the emergence of real, Indian hip-hop. It echoed the same story that gave birth to hip-hop in New York  the story of the streets," says Tej Brar, a self-confessed hip-hop fiend and head of talent at OML. Indians are familiar with rap and hip-hop. Songs like 50 Cents' It's ma birthday and Eminem's Slim Shady have been played on rotation in every coffee shop, club and birthday party while the current crop of Punjabi rappers have ensured that everyone can lip sync to at least one song about daaru, dope-shope and brown rang girls. But Mere gully mein is different. The new-age desi rappers talk about corruption, lackadaisical governments, police brutality, family apathy, militancy and any issue that pushes them to speak out. (Divine compares Mumbai's citizenry to a herd of goats ready to be slaughtered by butcher-politicians). Quite a change from the kind of superficial, materialistic, aspirational hip-hop that surrounds us today. "Delhi had a bustling Punjabi rap/hip-hop scene. But they made songs about cars, alcohol, girls. We rapped about our gully, our city. It was genuine, authentic Indian hip-hop," says Divine, on a high after performing at the first-ever BBC Asian Network Festival at Eventim Apollo in London, which also featured popular singers like Kanika Kapoor and Badshah. By speaking in a language that everyone from a roadside hawker to a rickshaw guy to a businessman would understand, and issues that affect everyone, these rappers became a window into the reality that is contemporary India. "Hip-hop is modern-day protest music. Cleverly, through rhyme, you can speak your mind. That's the universal appeal. And the environment is ripe for it," says Cyrus Oshidar, managing director and creative director at 101india.com, a youth content portal that recently released a 12-part hip-hop documentary series called Hip-Hop Homeland. The series will next document the hip-hop scenes in Punjab and Shillong. Naezy, who recently released a song called Haq Hai, believes that hip-hop can be a game-changer. "Hip-hop ek aisa zariya hai jo hamare desh main bhi badlav la sakta hai (hip-hop is a way to bring about a change in our country). The masses think that hip-hop is about daaru, nasha, bling and swag but if you really look at hip-hop's antecedents, it was used to bring about a revolution. I want to remove people's misconceptions and rewrite the history of Indian hip-hop," Naezy declares quite ambitiously. Whether or not hip-hop brings about social change, the music industry is banking on its star, Divine, to rope in more talent and audiences. Sony Music India, which has signed on Divine, is confident that hip-hop is a key space in India. "Rapping and hip-hop both have picked up considerably here over the last couple of years. Rappers like Bohemia founded the genre in India, Divine, on the other hand, is slowly taking raw and real rap to the mainstream audiences. We will be signing more talent soon," says Rohan Jha, lead pop music, Sony Music India. Brar says it like it is: "2016 is the year of desi hip-hop." Divine: 25 (aka Vivian Fernandes) Chart-topper: Jungli Sher Performed at the inaugural BBC Asian Network Festival, London His video Jungli Sher scored 1 million views on YouTube Raps in Bambaiya Naezy: 24 (aka Naved Sheikh) Chart-topper: Aafat His video Aafat racked up over 4.7 lakh views on YouTube Will collaborate with lyricist Gulzar on Zoya Akhtar's hip-hop film Gully Boy Raps in Hindi and Urdu</text>

	<text>Even as India's first PM is scrubbed out from textbooks, his reputation is being savaged on the internet * Jawahar, the Arabic word for pearl, could not have been chosen by any Kashmiri Brahmin as a name for his child. * Jawaharlal Nehru's grandfather was Ghiasuddin Ghazi, a kotwal of the Mughals, who changed his name to Gangadhar Nehru. * Nehru was born in a brothel in Allahabad. * Nehru got a Catholic nun pregnant, and was indebted to the church for spiriting her away from India. He died of syphilis. * Amitabh Bachchan is his son. Welcome to the virtual world of Nehru vilification. Entirely unhinged from reality, these wild stories about India's first prime minister, who laid the foundations of its democracy, are nonetheless the default on the internet. Unlike the academic challenge of changing details in textbooks, the Web is a terrain for the taking. "Anything that questions dominant historical views is going to find visibility and virality online," says digital media scholar Nishant Shah. Crackpot stories about Nehru have circulated for decades - for instance, former RSS chief K S Sudarshan has claimed that Nehru killed Gandhi. But "these are voices that never made it to the mainstream. Now, because there is such a preponderance of them online, these rumours take on a life of their own," says Rohit Chopra, media studies professor at Santa Clara University, who works on online Hindutva. This is particularly problematic because for many people now, reality is what they can find through Google, he says. Nehru, of course, is highest on the list of hate objects for Hindutva extremists. "After Partition, and even more after Gandhi's murder, Nehru was convinced that India must not in any circumstances become a Hindu Pakistan. He saw the RSS as dangerous because of its demonising of minorities, and repeatedly and publicly attacked it," says historian Ramachandra Guha. And the RSS continues to attack him right back. The hegemony of his ideas, and the persistence of his bloodline are both intolerable to them. "Indira's, Rajiv's, Sanjay's, Sonia's and Rahul's mistakes (real or imagined) are retrospectively attached to Nehru," says Guha. On YouTube, a search for Nehru throws up smear after smear. The first, declaring him "Hindustan ka sabse ayyash aadmi", was watched 40,16,640 times at last count. These stories lay bare the campaign against him  Nehru must be cast as Muslim, westernised and dissolute, to discredit him. To establish him as a philanderer, there is a patchwork of images of Nehru at innocuous moments, with Jacqueline Kennedy and Mrinalini Sarabhai, embracing his sister at the airport, lighting a woman's cigarette. Last year, Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Centre for Internet and Society, caught sneaky edits to the Wikipedia entries of Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru, emanating from a central government IP address. Recently, a patently fake and misspelt "historical" letter did the rounds, where Nehru supposedly described Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal. The right wing has mastered the arts of seeding misinformation, says Shah. Their claims do not come from one author, but from many different users, each adding layers to the rumours. Then, he says, "It is a matter of faith through repetition, rather than truth through inquiry". While such conspiracy theories sprout all around the world, in India, they dominate search results, says Prakash. Apart from forums that rationally disagree with Nehruvian economics, foreign policy or defence, or make credible assertions about his positions, there are voices that simply slander Nehru. "Many kinds of right-wing animosities, economic, cultural and those that are reacting to the actions of the Nehru Gandhi family, come together in this attack," observes Prakash. These ideas have also taken root, to some extent. A startup employee unconnected to any political party recently set up a Twitter handle called Nehruvian, trying to counter such propaganda. He explains why he was stirred into action - "On a train to Lucknow, I was reading The Discovery of India, when a young man in his twenties asked me, "kyon padh rahe ho is chor ki kitaab?" And yet, there is no way to counter motivated rumours, short of undesirable censorship. Propaganda is a legitimate activity, and any rebuttal is also likely to be confined to its own echo chamber, Shah points out. Rather, what is needed is a new digital literacy, the "capacity to sift trustworthy information, to look critically at the sources they come from", says Prakash. As for Nehru, it may not be easy for textbook warriors of keyboard guerrillas to dislodge him. If after 52 years, there's still so much panic about his legacy, there must be something very durable about it."</text>

	<text>Whether it's the Mercedes hit-and-run in Delhi or the antics of the chaddi baniyan gang in Mumbai, police are increasingly relying on CCTV footage to solve crimes. Sunday Times looks at how the small picture is getting bigger In case after high-profile case, cameras have been the big stars of Delhi police investigations in recent months. After the Civil Lines hit-and-run case, where a 17-year-old driving a Mercedes was caught on camera speeding away from his victim, reliable witness to the crime came from a nearby CCTV. A few weeks ago, in the Vikaspuri lynching on Holi eve that threatened to take on communal colours, it was CCTV footage that clinched the case. Across India, police officials reel off cases where CCTVs have made all the difference in identifying offenders and speeding up investigations. "Petty crimes like snatchings have been brought down by 50% in areas like Chandni Chowk since 2014," estimates Madhur Verma, DCP (north), Delhi Police. "Even if the face cannot be fully recognised, the timing shown on the CCTV grabs, and proof of the accused being present at the spot, can be useful corroborating evidence for the court," says DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni, explaining how CCTV helped nail the infamous "chaddi baniyan gang" in Borivli, Mumbai. CCTV cameras have proliferated across our public spaces in the last few years, mutely observing our movements. It's not just the police; shops, companies and individuals install them too, and these come in handy for law enforcement. For instance, Delhi has about 1,79,000 CCTV cameras installed around the city, out of which 4,000 have been placed by the Delhi government, and the rest by private agencies who collaborate with the Delhi Police under its 'Eyes and Ears' scheme. "Cameras are a fact of life around the world, there's no going back for the police or for anyone else," says N Ramachandran, a former IPS officer, now president of the Indian Police Academy think-tank. Whether London, Boston or Bengaluru, it is often a terrorist attack that shocks a city into ramping up its CCTV network. After the Church Street attacks, the police got cracking on surveillance, using crime-mapping techniques and shortlisting vantage points. While they currently use 300 cameras, the police believe the figure must be taken up to 2,500 to keep a better eye on the city. But does CCTV control crime? To that question, there is only one unsatisfying answer  it depends. The debate is torn between those who see CCTVs as the embodiment of an eerie Orwellian warning, and those who believe that the more cameras there are, the less crime there will be. Studies, though, suggest that CCTV has specific and narrow uses. Obviously, it helps catch people who have committed an offence, after the event. CCTV networks, though, have no noticeable impact on crime rates according to several reviews in the US and UK. The UK is the most monitored nation in the world, but as a Home Office study in 2005 concluded, there was no statistically significant reduction in crime, once other variables like seasonal and national trends, and other police initiatives, were factored in. While CCTVs are not easy to isolate as a determining factor in crime control, they are demonstrably effective in some contexts. They can reduce some kinds of disorder and petty crime, particularly in car parks and public transit. Micro-level analyses of aspects like environmental features, camera line-of-sight, enforcement activity, and camera design suggest that the power to deter crime depends greatly on how the CCTV sites are chosen, and police operations designed. The downsides are well known. The more mundane footage there is, the harder it is for police to sift through. There is often a displacement effect  the presence of a camera pushes the crime off-stage into other areas, or prompting criminals to change tactics in pursuit of the same ends (ie, rather than carry out a drug transaction on the street, arrange online and deliver). What's more, CCTVs can be gamed. In Mumbai, the police has found out that criminals apply toothpaste or flash a torchlight at the lens, or cover up with helmets and burqas, or even steal the digital video recorder in the CCTV. These cameras have to be constantly maintained. "Many believe that CCTV installation is a one-time investment, but it needs to be serviced to yield results," says S. David, who runs an electronics shop and sells CCTV cameras in Chennai's Ritchie Street. If there is no overwhelming impact on crime prevention, why are India's security forces investing so heavily in CCTVs, and is it worth the inevitable tradeoff with privacy? More worryingly, it is doing so without any comprehensive regulation on their use. Before this technology of databases and recording, "we seldom had situations where a police official or private detective was trailing you all day, recording your movements, which is more or less the situation with CCTVs now," says Pranesh Prakash of the Centre for Internet and Society. "Yes, you're in a public space, but that doesn't denude you of privacy". But as Farhad Manjoo, a prominent tech blogger in the US, pointed out, the benefits outweigh our fears about privacy. "When you weigh cameras against other security measures, they emerge as the least costly and most effective choice. In the aftermath of 9/11, it's impossible for you to get into tall buildings, airports, many museums, concerts, and even public celebrations without being subjected to pat-downs and metal detectors. When combined with competent law enforcement, surveillance cameras are more effective, less intrusive, less psychologically draining, and much more pleasant than these alternatives," wrote Manjoo in Slate. What we need is public oversight over the surveillance apparatus  in other words, we need to watch how they watch us. If there is clear respect for the principles of proportionality, accountability and transparency, "there need not be a conflict between ethical and effective use of these cameras," says Ramachandran.

	<text>You can see them in almost every village in drought-hit Marathwada  people, especially women and children, walking miles to fetch a single pot of water. But tiny Patoda, on the fringes of water-starved Aurangabad city, is different. It is surrounded by arid villages but people here just go to the water ATM nearby to get their share of potable water. Patoda's residents have learnt a valuable lesson  that water is more precious than money. They follow strict rules about usage and water audits are stringent. Households have water meters and the entire village recycles every drop of waste water it generates. So effective is its water conservation model that Patoda has now become a model for the rest of Marathwada. "It didn't happen overnight. We have been working for the last 10-12 years to ensure that every raindrop is saved and no water, not even waste, flows out of our village. The water balance sheet you see today is the result of strict discipline," says Bhaskar Pere-Patil, who developed the water model which has won 22 state and national awards. "The drought in Marathwada is man-made. People have failed to make efficient use of available water or recycle it. If Israel can perform miracles in its arid land, why can't we?" Pere-Patil asks. Patoda's story is the stuff film scripts are made of. It used to be a filthy village that suffered perennial water shortage. Pere-Patil, who has only studied till Class VII, was once a local hooligan who terrorized villagers into voting for him as sarpanch. In the years when he headed the village, he did nothing for it. Then one day, 10 years ago, Pere-Patil happened to overhear villagers talking about him. "I was shocked to learn that people saw me as some kind of a wild animal. I realized that they showed me deference only because I had money and muscle. I would earn their respect only if I did something for them," says Pere-Patil. Not only did he decide to change himself, but he also set about driving change in the village. His first initiative was to stop open defecation. Then came the troubling issue of water. "Initially, we went along only because we were afraid of him. But after some time, we realized that he is genuinely trying to change himself and the village," say the women. They soon joined his mission. The Kham River, which flows past the village, had been reduced to a nullah with unchecked release of sewage and effluents. The wells had no potable water and the government water supply scheme was neither enough nor potable. "We were forced to look elsewhere for a solution. We could not generate water, but we could certainly conserve what we get. The first step was saving rainwater by building several bunds across the nullahs. Today, no rain water flows out of our village. Percolation has recharged the aquifers and the water table has risen," says Pere-Patil. Once water was available in village wells, the gram panchayat decided to set up a water filtration plant on its own. Then came the concept of a water meter and ATM machine. Though there were government funds for various schemes the core contribution came from the villagers. Today, the gram panchayat provides 20 litres of filtered mineral water free to all the 581 families that use ATM cards. The machine operates 24x7 through the year. "It will never be empty. We have deposited all our effort in it," says youngster Ravindra Jadhav as he inserts a card into the slot to draw 20 litres of water. Additional filtered water is available through metered water supply at Rs 5 per 1,000 litres. Water from the government supply scheme and some wells is used for washing and cleaning. How they did it: * Bunds built to save rain water * Stabilisation ponds set up. Here, multiple forms of bacteria and algae act together to clean waste water which is then used for farming ?

	<text>l Jan 21, 2015: Gangster Sukha Kahlon is gunned down in Phagwara by a rival gang. The killers dance around his bloodied body, shoot a video and post it online. On the Facebook page of Kahlon, who was facing 40 criminal cases, RIP messages pour in and many swear revenge. l Feb 20, 2016: Ravi Khwajke, a sarpanch, is shot dead at a marriage function in Ludhiana. Notorious hitman Davinder Bambiha takes 'credit' for the murder on his FB page, gets over 500 'likes'. l April 30, 2016: Gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky is shot dead near Parwanoo in Himachal triggering an online war among criminals to hog credit. Welcome to the ganglands of Punjab where rival gangsters are not only bumping off each other on the streets but also boasting about their crimes on social media while projecting themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods. Many of these bandolier-sporting and gun-toting gangsters call themselves 'Lions of Punjab'; some have pictures of Khalistani icon Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as their FB cover photo. For them, a murder is not complete until they take responsibility for it online for all to know and 'like'. Last month when gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky, who faced multiple criminal cases and had contested the 2012 Punjab assembly elections from Fazilka and almost won, was slain near Parwanoo, it sparked off hectic online activity among criminals. A day later, gangster Jai Pal, an ex-cop's son from Ferozepur who is on the run, posted that he was the one who had actually killed Rocky, a claim the cops are taking seriously given his crime record. The same day friends and followers of Rocky created 'RIP Jaswinder Singh Rocky'  thousands posted messages on the page, calling Rocky a 'legendary man' and swearing revenge. Many of the gang-related murders in the last four years were instigated on Facebook  the killers boasted about their deed and humiliated rivals by posting messages on the pages of their victims. The hate messages are not removed by gangs and continue to feed their hatred for years. The celebratory video clip made by Kahlon's killers went viral last year. Even those in high-security jails across Punjab have been updating their FB accounts, taking credit for various crimes. But prison officials insist these are being operated by their supporters outside. ADGP (Prisons) M K Tiwari says, "We raided three jails after the killing of gangster Rocky but did not recover any SIM or phone, including in Nabha Jail, where gangster Vicky Gounder, who claimed responsibility for Rocky's killing, is lodged." Rajesh Gill, professor of sociology at Panjab University, says it's a worrying trend. "Some youngsters continue to eulogize militancy and believe that guns and violence are the easiest and shortest way to fame. This is also reflected in popular Punjabi songs, which are all about guns and killings," he says. Incidentally, the Punjabi Sahit Akademi had recently passed a resolution against Punjabi songs that glorify gun culture, saying such songs brainwash youngsters into believing there is pride and glory in crime. Gangsters also post messages of courage and fearlessness on their pages, portraying themselves as brave do-gooders on the wrong side of the law. Jitender Mohan, professor emeritus of psychology, Panjab University, says 'showing off' and bragging are part of Punjabi culture. "These gangsters are also desperate attention seekers and have found that the easiest way to fame, rather infamy, is through guns and false bravado," says Mohan. Is there no stopping them? According to IGP (cyber crime) P K Sinha, the cyber cell has been tracking the activities of gangsters online and action will be taken soon. "We are in the process of approaching Facebook headquarters in California through MHA to request them to disable some of the accounts. We are also exploring legal ways under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which authorizes law enforcement agencies to act against people using the internet against the sovereignty of the state," he adds. In the meantime, the gangs seem to be plotting their next hit. A day after Rocky's murder in Himachal, gangster Jaipal sent a chilling warning to rival gangs and cops in a message on FB: "The game has just begun. Just Wait and Watch." (With inputs from Vaivasvat Venkat in Ludhiana) Online lives of dead gangsters Shera Khuban: Headed the Gounder gang and was killed by Punjab police in Sept 2012, allegedly on a tipoff from Rocky's gang members. His FB account continues to be operational and posts are updated regularly. The FB page of Gounder gang has over 5,000 likes and members post important and frequent updates here Happy Deora: A close pal of gangster Jai Pal and later Rocky, Happy was killed allegedly by Shera Khuban in July 2012. RIP messages still continue to pour in on his FB page Sukha Kahlon: Nicknamed himself 'Sharpshooter', had over 10 FB pages, some of them by his fans, and many continue to be operational. After his murder, his FB page had issued warnings to two Punjab cops. One of his FB pages introduces him as "25 pindaaaa ch charcha... Jatt te 302 da parcha... (Most talked about in 25 villages...This Jat has a murder case against him) Lovely Baba: Part of the Gounder gang, he was killed, allegedly by gangster Sukha Kahlon in 2014.

	<text>PARIS: Researchers said Tuesday they had uncovered fossils showing that complex life on Earth began more than 1.5 billion years ago, nearly a billion years earlier than previously thought. But the evidence, published in Nature Communications, immediately provoked debate, with some scientists hailing it as rock solid, and others saying they were wholly unconvinced. After first emerging from the primordial soup, life remained primitive and unicellular for billions of years, but some of those cells eventually congregated like clones in a colony. Scientists even took to calling the later part of this period the "boring billion", because evolution seemed to have stalled. But at some point there was another huge leap, arguably second in importance only to the appearance of life itself, towards complex organisms. This transition progressively gave rise to all the plants and animals that have ever existed. Exactly when multi-cell eukaryotes, organisms in which differentiated cells each contain a membrane-bound nucleus with genetic material, showed up has inflamed scientific passions for many decades. The new study is sure to enrich that tradition. "Our discovery pushes back nearly one billion years the appearance of macroscopic, multicellular eukaryotes compared to previous research," Maoyan Zhu, a professor at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, told AFP. The fossils were uncovered in Hebei Province's Yanshan region, where Mao Zedong and his communist army hunkered down during World War II before coming to power. Zhu and colleagues found 167 measurable fossils, a third of them in one of four regular shapes, an indication of complexity. The largest one measured 30 by eight centimetre (12 by three inches). Taken together, they are "compelling evidence for the early evolution of organisms large enough to be visible with the naked eye," said Zhu. "This totally renews current knowledge on the early history of life." Up to now, eukaryotes of comparable size have not shown up in the fossil record until about 600 million years ago, when a multitude of soft-bodied creatures inhabited the world's oceans. Phil Donoghue, a professor of palaeobiology at the University of Bristol, described the discovery as a "big deal". "They are not the oldest eukaryotes, but they are certainly the oldest demonstrably multicellular eukaryotes," he told AFP. Their very existence 1.56 billion years ago would mean that "oxygen levels were sufficiently high to allow for such large organisms to subsist." But other experts were more sceptical. "There is nothing here to suggest that the specimens are eukaryotic, as opposed to bacterial," said Jonathan Antcliffe, a senior researcher in the University of Oxford's department of zoology. bacteria are, by definition, unicellular, and do not have distinct nuclei containing genetic material. Antcliffe suggested the fossils more likely corresponded to colonies of bacterial cells, rather than a single complex organism. Truly multicellular creatures display three-dimensional form in which only some cells are in direct contact with the environment. This is "critically important for function because it introduces transport problems for oxygen, nutrients, and signaling molecules" needed by the internal cells, Andrew Knoll of Harvard University explained in an article reviewing scientific literature on the origins of complex life. Another researcher, Abderrazak El Albani of the University of Poitiers in France, said there simply wasn't enough detail in the study to back up the claim. "The morphological measures, on their own, are absolutely insufficient to tell us if these organisms were multicellular, eucaryotes or complex," he told AFP when asked to comment. El Albani is himself no stranger to controversy on this topic. A 2010 study he published in Nature's flagship journal claiming to have discovered the remains of 2.1 billion year old cell colonies in Gabon has been widely challenged, including by Zhu and Antcliffe, who described it as "largely discredited."</text>

	<text>A man whose penis was removed because of cancer has received the first penis transplant in the United States, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Thomas Manning, 64, a bank courier from Halifax, Massachusetts, underwent the 15-hour transplant operation on May 8 and 9. The organ came from a deceased donor. "I want to go back to being who I was," Manning said on Friday in an interview in his hospital room. Sitting up in a chair, happy to be out of bed for the first time since the operation, he said he felt well and had experienced hardly any pain. "We're cautiously optimistic," said Dr. Curtis L. Cetrulo, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and a leader of the surgical team. "It's uncharted waters for us." The surgery is experimental, part of a research program with the ultimate goal of helping combat veterans with severe pelvic injuries, as well as cancer patients and accident victims. If all goes as planned, normal urination should be possible for Manning within a few weeks, and sexual function in weeks to months, Cetrulo said. Manning welcomed questions and said he wanted to speak out publicly to help dispel the shame and stigma associated with genital cancers and injuries, and to let other men know there was hope of having normal anatomy restored. "Don't hide behind a rock," he said. He said he was not quite ready to take a close look at his transplant. He will have to take several anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life. One of them, tacrolimus, seems to speed nerve regeneration and may help restore function to the transplant, Cetrulo said. Another patient, his penis destroyed by burns in a car accident, will receive a transplant as soon as a matching donor becomes available, Cetrulo said. Surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine are also planning to perform penis transplants, and have had a combat veteran, injured in Afghanistan, on the waiting list for several months. Cetrulo estimated the cost at $50,000 to $75,000. Both hospitals are paying for the procedures, and the doctors are donating their time. Worldwide, only two other penis transplants have been reported: a failed one in China in 2006 and a successful one in South Africa in 2014, in which the recipient later fathered a child. Veterans are a major focus of transplant programs in the United States because suicide rates are exceptionally high in soldiers with severe damage to the genitals and urinary tract, Cetrulo said. "They're 18- to 20-year-old guys, and they feel they have no hope of intimacy or a sexual life," he said. "They can't even go to the bathroom standing up." Given the psychological toll, he said, a penis transplant can be lifesaving. Cetrulo said the team would most likely perfect its techniques on civilian patients and then move on to injured veterans. It will also train military surgeons to perform the transplants. The Department of Defense, he said in an email, "does not like to have wounded warriors undergo unproven techniques - i.e., they do not want them to be 'guinea pigs,' as they have already sacrificed so much." His team is working on ways to minimize or even eliminate the need for anti-rejection medicines, which transplant patients typically have to take. That research is especially important for veterans, he said, because many are young and will risk serious adverse effects, like cancer and kidney damage, if they have to take the drugs for decades. From 2001 to 2013, 1,367 men in the military suffered so-called genitourinary injuries in Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense Trauma Registry. Nearly all were under 35 and had been hurt by homemade bombs, commonly called improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Some lost part or all of their penises. The Massachusetts General team spent three years preparing for the penis transplants. The team did meticulous dissections in a cadaver lab to map out anatomy, and operated on five or six dead donors to practice removing the tissue needed for the transplants. Manning's operation involved about a dozen surgeons and 30 other health care workers. Dr. Dicken Ko, a team leader and the director of the hospital's regional urology program, said the team had not planned a set number of transplants. Instead, he said, the hospital would evaluate candidates one at a time and decide whether to allow surgery. For now, he said, the transplants will be limited to cancer and trauma patients, and will not be offered to transgender people. An accident at work in 2012 brought Manning to the hospital, and ultimately to the transplant team. Heavy equipment had fallen on him, causing severe injuries. The doctors treating him saw an abnormal growth on his penis that he had not noticed. Tests revealed an aggressive and potentially fatal cancer. Penile cancer is rare, with about 2,030 new cases and 340 deaths expected in the United States this year. If not for the accident, Manning said, "I would've been in the ground two years ago." Doctors said that to save his life, they would have to remove most of his penis, in an operation called a partial penectomy. Manning's urologic oncologist, Dr. Adam S. Feldman, estimated that a few hundred men a year needed full or partial penectomies because of cancer. Manning was left with a stump about an inch long. He had to sit to urinate. Intimacy was out of the picture. He was single and was not involved with anyone when the cancer was found. After the amputation, new relationships were unthinkable. "I wouldn't go near anybody," he said. He continued: "I couldn't have a relationship with anybody. You can't tell a woman, 'I had a penis amputation.'" Some people close to him urged him to keep the operation a secret, but he refused, saying that was like lying, and he had nothing to be ashamed of. "I didn't advertise, but if people asked, I told them the truth," he said, adding that a few male friends made "guy talk" jokes at his expense, but that it toughened him up. "Men judge their masculinity with their bodies," he said. Before he had even left the hospital after the amputation, he began asking Feldman about a transplant. No one at the hospital was considering the idea yet, and Feldman admits that he thought it was a bit outlandish. But Manning never gave up hope. "I kept my eye on the prize," he said. Soon Cetrulo and Ko began talking about transplants. About three years later, Feldman called Manning to ask if he still wanted the operation. After a battery of medical tests, interviews and psychological grilling - typical for transplant candidates, to make sure they understand the risks and will take anti-rejection medicine - Manning was on the waiting list. Two weeks later, a donor with the right blood type and skin tone became available. Manning was stunned that it had happened so fast. Cetrulo credits the New England Organ Bank, which asks families of some dying patients to consider organ donation. The organ bank said the donor's family wished to remain anonymous but had extended a message to Manning saying they felt blessed and were delighted his recovery was going well. Organ banks do not assume that families who donate internal organs like kidneys and livers will also be willing to give visible or intimate parts like a face, hands or a penis. Those requests are made separately. Several families have agreed to allow the penis to be removed, and none have declined, said Jill Stinebring, the organ bank's regional director of organ donation services. So far, Manning has had one serious complication. The day after his surgery, he began to hemorrhage and was rushed back to the operating room. Since then, his recovery has been smoother, he said. Manning has no regrets. He looks forward to going back to work and hopes to eventually have a love life again. "If I'm lucky, I get 75 percent of what I used to be," he said. "Before the surgery I was 10 percent. But they made no promises. That was part of the deal."</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: High blood pressure can significantly raise the risk of developing vascular dementia , a disease which affects around 7 lakh people in India, a new study found. Researchers in the new study have found that high blood pressure was associated with 62 per cent higher risk of vascular dementia between the ages of 30-50. The conclusion was arrived at after the medical records of more than four million people were analysed and studied. The new study conducted by George Institute for Global Health (GIGH) which was published in the journal of the American Heart Association. A common form of dementia caused by an impaired supply of blood to the brain such as may be caused by a series of small strokes. "Vascular dementia rates are increasing all over the world and will pose a significant economic and social burden in both developed and developing countries. So these results are particularly important," said lead author of the study, Kazem Rahimi who is also the deputy director of GIGH. The GIGH statement said vascular dementia affects around 700,000 people in India and is caused by reduced blood supply to the brain due to diseased blood vessels. "We already know that high blood pressure can raise the risk of stroke and heart attack. What makes this study significant is that, for the first time it has shown that high blood pressure is also associated with a significantly higher risk of vascular dementia," said Vivekanand Jha, executive director GIGH. The team at GIGH analysed the medical records of 4.28 million people in the UK and found over a seven year period 11,114 people developed vascular dementia. The study found patients aged 30-50, who had high blood pressure, had a 62 per cent higher risk of vascular dementia, and a 26 per cent higher risk at age 51-70. The study also found that high blood pressure was still a risk factor even after adjusting for the presence of stroke, the leading cause of vascular dementia. "Our results suggest that lowering blood pressure, either by exercise, diet or blood pressure lowering drugs, could reduce the risk of vascular dementia," Rahimi said. GIGH in the statement said that high blood pressure causes problems by damaging and narrowing the blood vessels in the brain and over time raises the risk of a blood vessel becoming blocked or bursting.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: In a pioneering effort, a team of researchers has genetically engineered a clone of the Zika virus strain . According to them, cloning the virus can help in the development of counter-measures and exploring how or whether the Zika virus has evolved to spread more quickly and cause more severe diseases in people. "The Zika clone, together with mosquito infection models and the Zika mouse model, represent a major advance towards deciphering why the virus is tied to serious diseases," said lead author Pei-Yong Shi, professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, US. "The new clone is also a critical step in developing a vaccine and antiviral drug against Zika," Shi added in a paper published in journal 'Cell Host and Microbe'. In the study, the team first individually cloned five genome fragments and then assembled them together to form the Zika virus clone. The researchers then used the Zika mouse model to demonstrate that the cloned virus infected the mice and gave them neurological disease. The team fed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, one of the mosquito types known to transmit Zika, with human blood infected with either the parental Zika virus or the "man-made" Zika virus and found that the number of infected mosquitoes was similar. A number of possible factors that may account for the current Zika virus epidemic can now be tested with the clone, the researchers noted.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: India successfully test-fired indigenously developed nuclear capable Prithvi-II missile on Wednesday. The short-range surface-to-surface missile was tested from test range at Chandipur in Odisha. Such training launches clearly indicate India's operational readiness to meet any eventuality. Inducted into India's armed forces in 2003, Prithvi II, it is the first missile to be developed by DRDO under India's prestigious IGMDP (Integrated Guided Missile Development Program) is now a proven technology. The twin-engine Prithvi-II is 8.56 metre in length, 1.1 metre in width and weighs 4,600 kg. It has the ability to dodge enemy missiles. The battlefield missile has a flight duration of 483 seconds and a peak altitude of 43.5km. Notably, Prithvi is India's first indigenously-built ballistic missile. Prithvi-II has been designed to operate with both liquid and solid fuels and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads. The last user trial of Prithvi-II was successfully conducted on February 16, 2016, preceded by a trial on November 14, 2014.</text>

	<text>WAGGENINGEN: Establishing a human colony on the Moon and travelling to Mars has been the stuff of dreams since the dawn of the space age. But these visions face many hurdles. How can humans survive for months or years in the ultra-hostile environment of space? What, for instance, will they eat? Agricultural researchers at a Dutch university say they are taking the first steps towards providing an answer. They are growing vegetables in soils similar to those found on the Moon and Mars, looking for ways of helping space pioneers grow their own crops. "When people go to the Moon and Mars they also have to eat, and it's easiest for them to grow their own food," said Wieger Wamelink, surrounded by several dozen plants in a special greenhouse at Wageningen, an agricultural university in central Netherlands. "We wanted to use real Martian and lunar soil," to see if plants would actually grow in it, Wamelink told AFP. Of course, getting real lunar and Martian potting soil is an impossible task. But an Internet search revealed an unlikely supplier: NASA. The US space agency makes ground similar to that on the Moon from sand found in an Arizona desert, while Mars' crimson "soil" is scooped from a volcano in Hawaii, Wamelink told AFP. The first experiments started in 2013 after Wageningen received an order of 100 kilograms of NASA's imitation "space soil" -- at a hefty price of 2,000 euros. Wamelink stuck tomatoes, peas, cress and other plants in pots containing the simulated soil... and crossed his fingers. To work in this soil "was very special. Nobody, not even NASA, could tell us what would happen," even just by simply adding water, he said. The imitation ground at first was a little "reluctant" to absorb water, but soon turned out to be good potting soil. Like the actor Matt Damon in the science fiction movie "The Martian", Wamelink watched with amazement as his "space veggies" grew bigger day-by-day. "Especially in the Martian soil, plants were growing very fast and very good. They even started to flower, something that we never anticipated," Wamelink said. The 50-day experiment was written up in the science journal PLOS One in August 2014. An essential question however remains whether these unusual vegetables are safe to eat. Martian and lunar soil, including NASA's own imitation, may contain heavy metals that are harmless to plants but could prove deadly to humans. Wamelink has come up with a possible solution. If analyses show that the vegetables contain arsenic, mercury or iron making them unfit for human consumption, the soil can be purified by growing other plant species such as violets which absorb the poisons. Wamelink concedes that the experiment has a drawback -- it is being conducted in non-sterile conditions on Earth where only the nutrient quality of the soil is being assessed. "There's much more to test," Wamelink admitted. Extremely cold temperatures -- dropping to minus 62 degrees celsius on Mars -- as well as a lack of oxygen means that lunar or Martian vegetables and fruit could only be grown in a closed and controlled environment. The facility would have to be pressurized to normal atmospheric conditions on Earth, heated and lit, and protected from cosmic radiation, which damages plant DNA. That points to a "space greenhouse" -- a type of container, buried underground and kitted out with solar panels and LED lighting. Water should be no problem as it is found as ice on both the Moon and Mars, said Wamelink. Other questions which need answers include the presence of friendly bacteria to help plant growth and what happens to plants that grow in low gravity. NASA plans a human trip to Mars within the next 10 to 15 years or so but similar plans are also being pursued by billionaire Elon Musk and the Dutch company Mars One, tentatively aiming to set up human colonies on the Red Planet. Technology and the know-how to keep astronauts alive on Mars still has a long way to go said Christophe Lasseur, a European Space Agency (ESA) "Life Support" expert, who deals with metabolic aspects of space travel. Lasseur believed Wamelink's research of growing plants in space soils "is not a priority". He said other requirements for space survival like the proper infrastructure to grow similar vegetables in laboratories was far more essential to provide "maximum reliability" for future teams. "We must regard a plant as a piece of technology and understand exactly what happens to it first. All chemical, microbiological and physiological aspects (of plants in extraterrestrial conditions) need to be understood and mapped... We cannot take risks."</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: After several years of development work, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) will, on Monday, launch the re-usable launch vehicle technology demonstrator (RLV-TD) 70-km from earth and hope to bring it back. A successful test launch, which has been postponed multiple times in the last two-and-a-half years, will go a long way in giving Isro a technology that will reduce the launch cost to one tenth of the present expenditure. Isro chairman AS Kiran Kumar had told TOI last month that all tests barring the acoustics test were already done and the vehicle  an aircraft like object that could fly out of the earth's atmosphere and come back  was to be moved to Sriharikota for the launch. Officials in Isro confirmed that the launch is scheduled for 9.30am on Monday. "The vehicle is already in Sriharikota and the launch has been scheduled for Monday morning. The only reason it can be postponed is if the weather in general and wind speed in particular is not conducive for the launch." "Once launched, the vehicle will be guided by our scientists from ground stations and it will also be guided back to land about 500 km from the coast of Chennai," the official said. "The vehicle, a prototype, is a scaled down version about one sixth the size of the intended demonstrator, which is why we need a perfect wind speed," an official explained. The vehicle will be launched on a Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) booster, a version lower than the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The launch vehicle will weigh 90 tonne, while the RLV-TD weighs 300-kg. The winged RLV-TD has been configured to act as a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies like hypersonic flight, autonomous landing, powered cruise flight and flight using air breathing propulsion towards realising a Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) fully reusable launch vehicle. There are two advantages to this technology: It is a crucial part of the proposed manned mission of Isro and it will cut the cost of space launches to one tenth of the present cost. The RLV-TD is part of the pre-launch testing of the proposed human space programme to be carried out for which the UPA-led government had sanctioned Rs 145 crore. Isro has already successfully completed the testing of the crew module, another important technology for the human space programme, last year. Multiple use of vehicle * Launch scheduled for 9.30am on Monday * Isro will test a winged vehicle that'll go 70-km into space and come back * It will be guided to land back in the Bay of Bengal 500-km from Chennai's coast * Technology once proven will cut launch costs to 1/10th of present prices * Design Theory of vehicle aims at multiple uses of vehicle * No such technology presently exists anywhere in the world</text>

	<text>LONDON: Inspired by the 'liquid wire' technique in spider webs, scientists have created novel composite fibres which extend like a solid and compress like a liquid. Pulling on a sticky thread in a spider's web and letting it snap back shows that the thread never sags but always stays taut - even when stretched to many times its original length. This is because any loose thread is immediately spooled inside the tiny droplets of watery glue that coat and surround the core gossamer fibres of the web's capture spiral. "The thousands of tiny droplets of glue that cover the capture spiral of the spider's orb web do much more than make the silk sticky and catch the fly," said Fritz Vollrath from the Oxford University in UK. "Surprisingly, each drop packs enough punch in its watery skins to reel in loose bits of thread. And this winching behaviour is used to excellent effect to keep the threads tight at all times, as we can all observe and test in the webs in our gardens," Vollrath said. The novel properties observed and analyzed by the scientists rely on a subtle balance between fibre elasticity and droplet surface tension. The team was also able to recreate this technique in the laboratory using oil droplets on a plastic filament. This artificial system behaved just like the spider's natural winch silk, with spools of filament reeling and unreeling inside the oil droplets as the thread extended and contracted. "While the web is simply a high-tech trap from the spider's point of view, its properties have a huge amount to offer the worlds of materials, engineering and medicine," said Herve Elettro, a doctoral researcher at the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie in France. "Our bio-inspired hybrid threads could be manufactured from virtually any components," Elettro. "These new insights could lead to a wide range of applications, such as microfabrication of complex structures, reversible micro-motors, or self-tensioned stretchable systems," he said. The study was published in the journal PNAS.</text>

	<text>BOSTON: A cancer patient has received the first penis transplant in the US, a Boston hospital said on Monday. Massachusetts General Hospital has confirmed that Thomas Manning of Halifax, Massachusetts, received the transplanted penis in a 15-hour procedure last week. The organ was transplanted from a deceased donor. The New York Times first reported the transplant on Monday. Dr Curtis Cetrulo, who helped lead the surgical team, tells the newspaper that normal urination should be possible for the 64-year-old. Sexual function would be possible in weeks to months. The Times reports most of Manning's penis was removed during his battle with penile cancer. The world's first penis transplant was performed at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa in December 2014. That patient had his penis amputated three years earlier after complications from a circumcision performed in his late teens. The university near Cape Town said in announcing the transplant in March 2015 that the 21-year-old patient, whose name was not released, made a full recovering following the nine-hour surgery and regained all function in the transplanted organ. A man in China received a penis transplant in 2005. That operation also appeared to be successful, but doctors said the man asked them to remove his new penis two weeks later because of psychological problems experienced by him and his wife.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) has deployed a bread loaf-sized Miniature X-Ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat from an airlock on the International Space Station to study the Sun's soft x-rays that can affect our communications systems. Soft X-rays can disrupt the Earth's upper atmosphere and hamper radio and GPS signals travelling through the region. The intensity of the soft x-ray emissions is continuously changing over a large range with peak emission levels occurring during large eruptions on the Sun called solar flares. MinXSS will operate for up to 12 months and the data will also help scientists understand the physics behind solar flares. The soft X-rays carry information about the temperature, density and chemical composition of material in the Sun's atmosphere, allowing scientists to trace how events like flares and other processes heat the surrounding material in the Sun's atmosphere. CubeSats are a new, low-cost tool for space science missions. Instead of the traditional space science missions, CubeSats are designed to take narrowly targeted scientific observations, with only a few instruments. For example, MinXSS uses a commercially purchased X-ray spectrometer for a detector and an extendable tape measure as a radio antenna. MinXSS was launched via the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative programme on December 6 last year aboard Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft through NASA's Commercial Resupply Services contract.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The Europa ocean on Jupiter's icy moon may have the Earth-like balance of chemical energy necessary for life, even if the moon lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a new Nasa study suggests. Europa is strongly believed to hide a deep ocean of salty liquid water beneath its icy shell. Whether the Jovian moon has the raw materials and chemical energy in the right proportions to support biology is a topic of intense scientific interest. The answer may hinge on whether Europa has environments where chemicals are matched in the right proportions to power biological processes. Life on Earth exploits such niches. In a new study, scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California compared Europa's potential for producing hydrogen and oxygen with that of Earth, through processes that do not directly involve volcanism. The balance of these two elements is a key indicator of the energy available for life. The study found that the amounts would be comparable in scale; on both worlds, oxygen production is about 10 times higher than hydrogen production. The work draws attention to the ways that Europa's rocky interior may be much more complex and possibly Earth-like than people typically think, according to Steve Vance, a planetary scientist at JPL and lead author of the study. "We're studying an alien ocean using methods developed to understand the movement of energy and nutrients in Earth's own systems. The cycling of oxygen and hydrogen in Europa's ocean will be a major driver for Europa's ocean chemistry and any life there, just as it is on Earth," said Vance. Ultimately, Vance and colleagues want to also understand the cycling of life's other major elements in the ocean: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. The researchers calculated how much hydrogen that could potentially be produced in Europa's ocean as seawater reacts with rock, in a process called serpentinisation. In this process, water percolates into spaces between mineral grains and reacts with the rock to form new minerals, releasing hydrogen in the process. Researchers considered how cracks in Europa's seafloor likely open up over time, as the moon's rocky interior continues to cool since its formation billions of years ago. New cracks expose fresh rock to seawater, where more hydrogen-producing reactions can take place. In Earth's oceanic crust, such fractures are believed to penetrate to a depth of 5 to 6 kilometres. On present-day Europa, the researchers expect water could reach as deep as 25 kilometres into the rocky interior, driving these key chemical reactions throughout a deeper fraction of Europa's seafloor. The other half of Europa's chemical-energy-for-life equation would be provided by oxidants - oxygen and other compounds that could react with the hydrogen - being cycled into the Europan ocean from the icy surface above. Europa is bathed in radiation from Jupiter, which splits apart water ice molecules to create these materials. The research was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</text>

	<text>SYDNEY: In a first, a team of physicists is using artificial intelligence (AI) to run a complex experiment to create an extremely cold gas trapped in a laser beam known as a Bose-Einstein condensate, replicating the experiment that won the 2001 Nobel Prize. Bose-Einstein condensates are some of the coldest places in the universe, far colder than outer space and typically less than a billionth of a degree above absolute zero. They can be used for mineral exploration or navigation systems as they are extremely sensitive to external disturbances, which allow them to make very precise measurements such as tiny changes in the Earth's magnetic field or gravity. Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, along with German-born theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, founded the basis for Bose-Einstein statistics. It describes the statistical distribution of identical particles with integer spin, now called subatomic particle or the "God particle" Boson. Britain's Peter Higgs and Belgian Francois Englert won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on the "God particle". "I didn't expect the machine could learn to do the experiment itself, from scratch, in under an hour," said co-lead researcher Paul Wigley from the Canberra-based Australian National University (ANU). The experiment was developed by physicists from ANU and University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy (UNSW ADFA). "A simple computer programme would have taken longer than the age of the Universe to run through all the combinations and work this out," Wigley added. The artificial intelligence system's ability to set itself up quickly every morning and compensate for any overnight fluctuations would make this fragile technology much more useful for field measurements. "You could make a working device to measure gravity that you could take in the back of a car, and the artificial intelligence would recalibrate and fix itself no matter what," noted co-lead researcher Dr Michael Hush from UNSW ADFA. The team cooled the gas to around one microkelvin and then handed control of the three laser beams over to the artificial intelligence to cool the trapped gas down to nanokelvin. Researchers were surprised by the methods the system came up with to ramp down the power of the lasers. "It did things a person wouldn't guess such as changing one laser's power up and down and compensating with another," said Wigley. "We now plan to employ the artificial intelligence to build an even larger Bose-Einstein condensate faster than we've seen ever before," noted Dr Hush in a paper published in the Nature group journal Scientific Reports.</text>

	<text>COLOGNE, Germany: Humans could set foot on Mars within decades if they wanted to, according to the German astronaut who has been tapped to become his country's first commander of the International Space Station. Alexander Gerst said the space station offers a unique opportunity to test the technology needed to explore other planets, especially if its lifetime is extended beyond 2020. "It is very clear to me that those manned missions to the moon and Mars, human missions, will happen," he told The Associated Press in an interview at the European Space Agency's astronaut training center in Cologne, Germany. "But we need the decision as a society. And once we do that we are ready to go, basically." Gerst said the recent Hollywood movie "The Martian"  starring Matt Damon as an astronaut fending for himself on the red planet  offers a realistic glimpse of the not-too-distant future. "It shows us what we can possibly reach in a few years' time," he said. "I'm actually quite excited by the fact that us humans, we could fly to Mars, and maybe you and I will live to see it." The 40-year-old volcanologist  an expert on volcanos, not the planet Vulcan from Star Trek  is scheduled to take command of the space station in May 2018, four years after his first mission, it was announced Wednesday. NASA aims to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Astronauts have been living continuously aboard the 250-mile (402-kilometer) -high International Space Station since 2000. This month, the space station hit the milestone of 100,000 orbits around Earth  the equivalent of 10 round trips to Mars, or almost one way to Neptune. Following NASA's longest human spaceflight yet, American Scott Kelly returned in March from a 340-day voyage with Russian Mikhail Kornienko. Scientists hope the results from wide-ranging medical tests will offer guidance on how the body will cope during the much longer Mars expeditions. Gerst will be the second European Space Agency astronaut in charge of the orbital outpost, after Belgian pilot Frank De Winne, reflecting Europe's growing interest in space. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was present for the announcement and who is a scientist by training, said recently it was "right and important" that space exploration should play a key important role in her country's high-tech strategy. The European Space Agency saw its budget increase almost 20 percent this year to 5.25 billion euros ($5.96 billion) and the agency is on course to activate Europe's satellite navigation system Galileo _ a rival to the American GPS, Russia's Glonass and China's Beidou systems  this decade. Earlier this year, ESA chief Jan Woerner suggested establishing a village on the moon once the International Space Station reaches the end of its lifetime. There are no concrete plans for this yet, though, and experts say the space station hasn't outlived its usefulness _ over 100 experiments are conducted during each mission to the space station. Gerst said the flying laboratory can help test whether humans are physically and psychologically capable of spending long periods of time in deep space and also how to conserve precious resources on Earth. "In this year, we decide whether to continue the International Space Station until 2024," he said. "Whether Europe is part of that and whether we will use that investment that we made in the past. So it is important not to stop investing in this field."</text>

	<text>LONDON: Psilocybin , the psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms, may one day be an effective treatment for patients with severe depression. It will be useful to treat patients who fail to recover using other therapies, scientists said on Tuesday. A small-scale pilot study of psilocybin's use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said. Of 12 patients given the drug, all showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven continued to show a positive response at three months. Five remained in remission beyond the three months. Robin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London's department of medicine , said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking. Many patients described a profound experience and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world. "But we shouldn't get carried away with these results," he told reporters at a briefing in London. "This isn't a magic bullet. We're just learning how to do this treatment." Magic mushrooms grow worldwide and have been used since ancient times, both for recreation and for religious rites. British researchers led by David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, have been exploring the potential of psilocybin to ease severe forms of depression in people who don't respond to other treatments. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that some 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression, a common mental disorder characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, tiredness, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, and poor concentration. Many patients respond to treatment with antidepressants and cognitive behavioural therapy, but around 20 per cent don't get better and are classed as having treatment-resistant depression. Psilocybin acts on the serotonin system, suggesting it could be developed for treating depression. But hallucinogenic drugs can also cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so Nutt's team wanted to find out if psilocybin could be given safely. The trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They all went through a full screening process before being allowed to participate and they were fully supported before, during and after they received psilocybin. The patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart. Blood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored during each session, and the patients were seen by a psychiatrist the next day and one, two, three and five weeks after the second dose. Carhart-Harris said no serious side effects were reported during the study, although all volunteers said they were slightly anxious before and during initial drug administration. "Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place," he said. "I wouldn't want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky." Nutt said the results showed that psilocybin "is safe and fast acting, so may - if administered carefully - have value for these patients."</text>

	<text>New geologic mapping in the Himalayan mountains of Kashmir suggests that the region is ripe for a major earthquake that could endanger the lives of as many as a million people, according to an Oregon State University statement. Scientists have found that the Reasi fault near Jammu has been building up pressure for some time, suggesting that when it does release or "slip", the resulting earthquake may be large  as much as magnitude 8.0 or greater. Scientists started looking at this fault more closely following the 7.6-magnitude earthquake in 2005 on the nearby Balakot-Bagh fault in the Pakistan side of Kashmir, which was not considered particularly dangerous because it wasn't on the plate boundary. The 2005 Kashmir earthquake killed about 80,000 people in Pakistan and India. Results of the new study, which was funded by the National Science Foundation of US, have been accepted for publication by the Geological Society of America Bulletin, and published online. "What we set out to learn was how much the fault has moved in the last tens of thousands of years, when it moved, and how different segments of the fault move," said Yann Gavillot , lead author on the study who did much of the work as a doctoral student at Oregon State University. "What we found was that the Riasi fault is one of the main active faults in Kashmir, but there is a lack of earthquakes in the more recent geologic record. The fault hasn't slipped for a long time, which means the potential for a large earthquake is strong. It's not a question of if it's going to happen. It's a matter of when." Gavillot said a major earthquake at the Riasi fault could have a major impact on Jammu, the Indian capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which has a population of about 1.5 million people. Another 700,000 people live in towns located right on the fault. "There are also several dams on the Chenab river near the fault, and a major railroad that goes through or over dozens of tunnels, overpasses and bridges," Gavillot said. "The potential for destruction is much greater than the 2005 earthquake." There is direct evidence of some seismic activity on the fault, where the researchers could see displacement of the Earth where an earthquake lifted one section of the fault five or more meters - possibly about 4,000 years ago. Written records from local monasteries refer to strong ground-shaking over the past several thousand years. But the researchers don't have much evidence as to how frequent major earthquakes occur on the fault, or when it may happen again. "The Riasi fault isn't prominent on hazard maps for earthquake activity, but those maps are usually based more on the history of seismic activity rather than the potential for future events," said Andrew Meigs, a geology professor in OSU's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and co-author on the study. "In actuality, the lack of major earthquakes heightens the likelihood that seismic risk is high." The researchers say 50 percent of the seismic "budget" for the fault can be accounted for with the new information. The budget is determined over geologic time by the movement of the tectonic plates. In that region, the India tectonic plate is being subducted beneath the Asia plate at a rate of 14 millimeters a year; the Riasi fault accounts for half of that but has no records of major earthquakes since about 4,000 years ago, indicating a major slip, and earthquake, is due. "In the last 4,000 years, there has only been one major event on the Riasi fault, so there is considerable slip deficit," Meigs said. "When there is a long gap in earthquakes, they have the potential to be bigger unless earthquakes on other faults release the pressure valve. We haven't seen that. By comparison, there have been about 16 earthquakes in the past 4,000 years in the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Northwest coast of the United States."</text>

	<text>LONDON: Sexual conflict between males and females can lead to changes in the shape of their genitals, finds a new research conducted on burying beetles. The findings showed that beetles genitals change shape when mating rates are high as females try to keep males at bay. "It's fascinating how genital evolution can happen so fast - in ten generations - showing how rapidly evolutionary changes can occur," said Paul Hopwood from the University of Exeter in Britain. The conflict over how often mating takes place could lead to males evolving longer penis-like organs and females larger 'claws' on their genitalia, within ten generations. Also, changes in one sex were reflected by changes in the shape of the other sex, showing there was co-evolution. "Our results show that sexual conflict over mating can lead to co-evolutionary changes in the shape of the genitals of burying beetles," added Hopwood. Sexual conflict over mating occurs because, whilst having lots of sex is usually good for a male -- as it increases the number of offspring he is likely to produce -- it is not so good for a female because she only needs to mate a few times to fertilise all her eggs. In addition, too much sex can be costly for female burying beetles as it reduces their ability to provide parental care. For the study, published in the journal Evolution, the researchers artificially selected pairs of burying beetles for either high mating rates or low rates for ten generations. The research found that this artificial selection resulted in changes in the shapes of both male and female genitalia. "Our research demonstrates the general importance of conflicts of interest between males and females in helping to generate some of the biodiversity that we see in the natural world," Hopwood noted.</text>

	<text>LOS ANGELES: Scientists have identified a 'sunscreen gene' that may help protect against melanoma , the deadliest form of skin cancer. Researchers found that melanoma patients with deficient or mutant copies of the 'UV radiation Resistance Associated Gene' are less protected from harmful ultraviolet rays. "If we understand how this UV-resistant gene functions and the processes by which cells repair themselves after ultraviolet damage, then we could find targets for drugs to revert a misguided mechanism back to normal conditions," said Chengyu Liang from University Of Southern California (USC) in the US. More than 90 per cent of melanoma skin cancers develop because of cell damage from exposure to UV radiation, researchers said. "People who have the mutated UV-resistant gene or low levels of the UV-resistant gene may be at higher risk of melanoma or other skin cancers, especially if they go sunbathing or tanning frequently," said Liang. "Our study suggests that the UV-resistant gene may serve as a biomarker for skin cancer prevention." Researchers used data from 340 melanoma patients. The study also included two experimental groups with either reduced levels of the UV-resistant gene or a mutant copy of that gene in melanoma cells and 50 fly eyes. The control groups were melanoma cells or fly eyes with normal copies of the UV-resistant gene. Scientists gave a UV shot to cells carrying the normal UV-resistant gene and cells carrying defective copies of it. After 24 hours, cells carrying normal versions of the gene had repaired more than 50 per cent of the UV-induced damage. In contrast, the defective samples repaired less than 20 per cent of the damaged cells, researchers said. "That means when people sunbathe or go tanning, those who have the normal UV-resistant gene can repair most UV-induced DNA burns in a timely manner, whereas those with the defective UV-resistant gene will have more damage left unrepaired," said Liang. "After daily accumulation, if they sunbathe or go tanning often, these people will have increased risk for developing skin cancers such as melanoma." Researchers were able to show a correlation with increased risk of cancer. Scientists first discovered the UV-resistant gene nearly two decades ago in relation to a disease called Xeroderma Pigmentosum, which makes people extremely sensitive to sunlight and puts them at high risk toward developing skin cancer. Researchers have now identified what the UV-resistant gene does and how it operates in a general population, said Yongfei Yang from USC. "We found the expression level of the UV-resistant gene is related to melanoma patients' survival and metastasis stages," said Yang. "Lower levels of the UV-resistant gene means a lower survival rate and advanced metastases stages." The findings were published in the journal Molecular Cell.</text>

	<text>PUNE: Hypertension is a very common but a grossly neglected disease. Untreated hypertension can lead to serious complications like brain stroke, kidney failure, and congestive heart failure and retinal problems. ENT specialist Siddharth Yande said, "Not many people know that obstructive sleep apnoea, a sleep disorder, is also a risk factor for hypertension. Proper treatment in time can definitely help control hypertension and reduce the risk of complications." "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is a serious sleep disorder in which there are obstructive episodes in sleep leading to a drop in blood oxygen levels during sleep. He added that obese people who have obstructive sleep apnoea should be extra careful of hypertension and any hypertensive person who has snoring must get himself or herself checked for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome,"Yande said. To avoid this, screening for hypertension and proper treatment for the same is a very important step, say experts. Pune chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has decided to take a small step by checking blood pressure of patients free of cost May 17. The state IMA has requested all its 37,000 plus members to volunteer free BP checkup at their clinics and hospitals.</text>

	<text>CHANDIGARH: Tension prevailed in Bhustala village of Kurukshetra after drunken youths of Rajput and other upper castes prevented a groom hailing from Dalit community from paying obedience in their temples on Saturday night. One cop was hurt while brokering peace between two warring groups. Additional police deployment has been made. A case of prevention of atrocities against SC and ST Act at Jhansa police station of Kurukshetra. Kurukshetra senior superintendent of police (SSP) Simardeep Singh claimed that situation is under control and additional police deployment has been made. "Police parties are on lookout for those involved in Saturday disturbance. Meanwhile, now family is performing the rituals," said SSP. According to information the incident occurred at the pre-wedding functions of a family, which happens to be from Valmiki community, a Dalit caste. While the family and friends were planning to take out ghurcharhi, some youths from Rajput community warned them against using chariot and mares. As they went on with celebration, the upper caste men did not allow them to offer prayers in temples constructed by upper castes. Meanwhile, police was informed and the family was pursued to complete rituals by offering prayers in Valmiki temple. Upset Dalit youths too started assembling and uneasy calm prevailed. Even the two communities men clashed in presence of cops and representatives of district administration.</text>

	<text>SRINAGAR: Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has revealed that he and his team-mates skipped dinner after their gut-wrenching one-run defeat against India in the recently concluded World T20. Mortaza, who is holidaying in Kashmir, interacted with the local youngsters. "We were very upset with that defeat. None of us had dinner that evening. Losing is a part of the game and we did not want to lose that match," Mortaza was quoted as saying by a local website, when a local boy asked about Bangladesh not being able to score two runs off the last three balls during their group league encounter against India. It was a chance encounter for the locals with the Bangladeshi captain as he stopped by at a village on Srinagar-Sonamarg road on Sunday. "On his way back to summer capital (Srinagar) from Sonamarg, he saw a few youngsters playing cricket at Kullan. Mortaza stopped the vehicle and met the players," the website report stated. The seamer gave some tips to the young players and even displayed his skills by bowling a few deliveries.</text>

	<text>Surat: Gold jewellery sector in India is not shining as per the latest report published by World Gold Council (WGC) for the first quarter of 2016. The gold jewellery demand in India, according to WGC report, hit a seven-year low of 88.4 tonnes, a 41 per cent year-on-year decline in the first quarter of 2016. This is 44 per cent below the five-year quarterly average for India of 156.7 tonnes and indicates the extent of troubles faced by the market during the quarter, which included the month-long strike by the jewellers demanding abolition of 1 per cent excise duty levy. According to the report, the sharp rise in the local gold prices through a number of key levels was discouraging in itself. The anticipation of a correction in prices and of a reduction in customs duty on gold kept jewellery demand tepid in February. However, the final blow came in the budget release on February 29 with Union finance minister proposing increase in customs on gold dore and one per cent levy of excise duty on jewellery articles. The decision to impose excise duty led to widespread strike by jewellers. The jewellery showrooms, bullion traders and manufacturing units in most of the states across the country downed their shutters demanding rollback of excise duty. The strike continued for almost 40 days from March 1. Sources said marriage season had already started by the end of March and that consumers were unable to buy jewellery at a time of such uncertainty. This, however, drastically reduced the demand for gold jewellery in the Indian market, thereby reflecting in the first quarter demand in 2016. "It's not only gold jewellery, but diamond-studded jewellery segment also suffered due to the nation-wide strike for over 40 days. Now things have settled down and we hope for better business in the coming quarters," Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) regional chairman Dinesh Navadiya said. SGCCI's gems and jewellery committee chairman Nainesh Patchigar said, "Again the soaring gold price has become a big deterrent for gold jewellery consumers in India. The price volatility is keeping consumers away from doing heavy purchases of jewellery. The trend of low-budget jewellery is picking up where consumers are preferring 18 carat gold jewellery."</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Donald Trump poured more than $7.5 million of his own money into his presidential campaign in April, bringing his total personal investment to more than $43 million since he declared his candidacy, new campaign finance reports filed late Friday show. The billionaire businessman, who swatted away 16 Republican rivals and relied heavily on wall-to-wall media coverage of his outsized personality and often inflammatory remarks, reported spending about $56 million during the primary, which lasted until his final two rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, dropped out of the race at the beginning of May. In April alone, Trump spent nearly $9.4 million, according to his monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission. Trump's largest expense in April, about $2.6 million, was for advertisements. The campaign also spent more than $930,000 on direct mail. Other big-ticket items included roughly $585,000 in airfare paid to Trump's TAG Air Inc. While much of Trump's money has come from his own pocket, he reported about $1.7 million in donations last month. Those contributions have come largely from people buying Trump's campaign merchandise, including the red ``Make America Great Again'' ball caps, and giving online through his campaign website. Trump didn't begin developing a team of fundraisers until recently, after he became the presumptive GOP nominee. Almost all of Trump's personal investment has come in the form of loans. That leaves open the possibility that he can repay himself now that he's aggressively seeking donations. A new fundraising agreement he struck with the Republican National Committee and 11 state parties explicitly seeks contributions for his primary campaign. Yet Trump said in a statement this week that he has ``absolutely no intention'' of paying himself back. Instead, he will be able to use any primary money he raises, in increments of up to $2,700 per donor, on expenses such as salaries, advertising and voter outreach over the next nine weeks. After the GOP convention in late July, Trump will officially become the nominee and be restricted to spending money that's earmarked for the general election. His likely rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, has a head start on building a war chest for the November election. She partnered with Democratic parties months ago and has been raising millions of dollars for them. In April alone, she collected almost $800,000 in campaign money for the general election. By contrast, Trump will hold his first campaign fundraiser next week, an event in Los Angeles where the minimum price of admission is $25,000, according to the invitation. Those donations are to be split among Trump's campaign and his Republican Party allies. In addition to the Trump campaign's financial health, the filings also show that when Cruz dropped out, money wasn't the issue: He had $9.4 million in his campaign coffers at the end of April, just days before his defeat May 3 in the Indiana primary prompted him to end his bid. At the time, Cruz said he left the race because he saw no path forward.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Donald Trump's inflammatory presidential campaign and the prospect of the brash-talking tycoon actually becoming commander-in-chief has left progressive Americans obsessing about one thing: moving to Canada. Stars from Cher to Lena Dunham have declared their intention to head north if the former reality star, famous for insulting Muslims and Mexicans, and under the microscope for alleged sexism, reaches top office. According to one recent Morning Consult/Vox poll, 28 percent of Americans would "likely" consider moving to another country if Trump wins in November. Google said the search "how can I move to Canada?" surged 350 percent on March 1 when Trump won seven Republican state elections. Money makers on both sides of the border have turned the hype into a savvy marketing tool. "Leaving he country if TRUMP is elected PRESIDENT? Give me a call and LET'S GET YOUR HOME SOLD!!" advertised one US realtor. A millennial entrepreneur in Texas set up dating site Maple Match promising to help Americans "find the ideal Canadian partner to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency." The site is the brainchild of 25-year-old Joe Goldman, who always wanted to set up a dating site but used the Trump bandwagon to drive publicity. While actual introductions and dates are a way off, Goldman says that more than 30,000 people hungry for love have already signed up. "The Donald Trump campaign for president has provided us with an opportunity to make something positive," he told AFP. "But ultimately Maple Match itself is not political. It's about bringing Americans and Canadians together." After Cape Breton Island, off the tip of Nova Scotia, offered a refuge to Trump-hating Americans earlier this year, visitors to its tourism site exploded from 65,000 last year to 600,000, says tourist chief Mary Tulle. US academic Neda Maghbouleh moved to Toronto three years ago with her husband when they were offered attractive faculty jobs at a university. Their daughter was born in Canada, the couple have acquired permanent residency and now they want to sponsor Maghbouleh's parents to join them. "My urgency and fear was really stoked by this election. It was a feeling that we need to be very proactive about this," she said. Businessman Nuri Katz, who helps people acquire second citizenship, says "tens" of clients have given Trump as a reason for wanting to relocate, but warns that there are huge obstacles to actually getting up and moving. "All this anecdotal talk about moving to Canada, it's really tough," he told AFP during a business trip to New York. "It's not going to be a flood of people just driving into Canada and saying 'here we are'," he said. Sortable, a web advertising company in Ontario, targeted US-based developers by cheekily offering "a safe place for smart, nice people" looking for an alternative to a Trump presidency earlier this year. But while the ad generated a lot of interest, the company has yet to recruit any Americans although talks are ongoing, says digital marketing officer Brenden Sherratt. Canada has tightened immigration procedures for many categories of people, although it has been liberal in accepting Syrian refugees. Americans opposed to Trump hardly meet the UN definition of a refugee, Katz warned. "It is a tough argument to make that you are being politically persecuted in the US," said Katz, president at Apex Capital Partners Corp. "Canada started accepting American political refugees? Boy, China would have a field day with that. Could you imagine?" Katz says Dominica in the Caribbean is the cheapest place for Americans to buy second citizenship -- yours for an investment of $100,000. He has also signed up his first American client for Cyprus, where nationality can be acquired in three months for a one-off investment of 2.5 million euros ($2.8 million). But Americans are a minority of those shopping for a second nationality and although a record number are renouncing citizenship, often for a combination of financial and political reasons, Katz says the industry is "tiny." And even if Americans have itchy feet, their country remains a premier destination for foreigners, particularly Chinese. An investor program grants green cards to those who invest at least $500,000 and create 10 full time jobs. But it's so inundated that the wait time is eight years, Katz said. As the daughter of Iranian immigrants, Maghbouleh grew up feeling lucky. "The US in so many ways is still the promised land for so many people," she admitted.</text>

	<text>PARIS: The girl, speaking in the lilting accent of southern France, appeared in government ads describing how she was recruited by Islamic State extremists during her quest for religion, then encouraged to quit school and go to Syria, and finally to plot a suicide attack against a synagogue at home. "I have a hard time even admitting now that I was indoctrinated," she says to the camera in the ad before breaking down, describing how she tried to recruit others. The teen, known as Lea, was meant to be the poster child of a nascent program in France aimed at de-radicalizing young people to stem their flow to Syria. But the jihadi rehab didn't work. Six times she reconnected with the extremists, and six times she called her counselor in tears to apologize. The seventh time, late in 2015, landed her in jail. France's effort is one of many around the world trying to break the hold Muslim radicals have on their recruits by figuring out what drew them to the groups in the first place. The United States has launched its first formal effort in Minnesota, on the orders of a federal judge. But it's not clear how effective the programs can be in the long term. France alone has nearly 2,000 people like Lea about 600 who have left for Syria, but far more who are involved in jihadi networks at home. Across Europe, an estimated 5,000 people have joined extremist fighters in Syria, and about a third of them have returned. Most, experts and government officials say, will cause no harm. Dounia Bouzar, who runs France's jihadi rehab program, works with more than 1,000 young people flagged as potential extremists. Lea's story, she said, is more the rule than the exception. Islamic State and al-Qaida extremists don't break off contact just because someone is caught and the young people themselves have a hard time pulling away from what she described as their 'online tribe.' "A young person who reconnects, that's normal," she said. "Monday, they come to bear witness and save others. Wednesday, they denounce someone who wants to leave and say, save him. And Friday, they re-connect and threaten your life." There is no reasoning with someone in the thrall of a jihadi group, those who run the program say, so the recruits have to experience tangible doubts about the jihadi promises they once believed. Bouzar said that can mean countering a message of anti-materialism by showing them the videos of fighters lounging in fancy villas or sporting watches with an Islamic State logo. Or finding someone who has returned from Syria to explain that instead of offering humanitarian aid, the extremists are taking over entire villages, sometimes lacing them with explosives. Only once doubts are seeded can young would-be jihadis themselves reason their way back to their former selves, she said. In the United States, a young Minnesota man who admitted he planned to go Syria to join the Islamic State group is among the first to take part in Minnesota's de-radicalization program, the first of its kind in the United States. In early 2014, just after turning 18, Abdullahi Mohamud Yusuf applied for a fast-track passport with a vague plan to go to Istanbul. He was stopped at the airport in May 2014, but remained free. He enrolled in community college, got a job, then was arrested in November that year on two terrorism charges for trying to join Islamic State. Yusuf, now 20, stayed in a halfway house while his case was pending and remained there after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He went back to jail after a box cutter was found beneath his bed. His lawyer says his client did not know anything about it. The program enlists the expertise of Daniel Koehler, a German researcher who works with would-be jihadis and their families. In the U.S., participants are already charged with terrorism offenses, and the goal is to assess their risk of backsliding and give them the tools to keep from slipping back into the networks that once drew them in. It's a form of psychological warfare, he said before leaving to evaluate the Minnesota suspects. What neither Koehler nor Bouzar will offer is immunity from charges. In the case of the Minnesota program, participants are already in the federal justice system. The program is initially being offered to Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. In France, Bouzar only deals with people who have not travelled to Syria. Nearly all the jihadis who return from the war zone are mostly voluntary and numbering around 250. The are jailed immediately. This is a sore subject for her, because, as she puts it "we just run after those who have repented" to offer the most persuasive arguments against joining. "I think the government is afraid of being manipulated," said Bouzar, who has an annual budget of around 600,000 euros ($676,000). "At the same time, I think for most of those who returned, it's because they saw the reality and it didn't correspond to their dreams. There's nothing better than someone who has escaped Daesh." That is why she placed so much hope in Lea's recovery, even though she knew the risk that Lea would reconnect with recruiters. One unexpected voice to emerge is that of Mourad Benchellali, a French former Guantanamo inmate cleared of terror links who now lectures to groups of young people throughout France and Belgium, including in Brussels' Molenbeek neighborhood, home to so many of the Paris and Brussels attackers. Benchellali, who was captured in 2001 after being misled into a trip that landed him in an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan, recounts his five years of imprisonment without rancor. And it's the lack of bitterness that may resonate the most. He has returned to the French prison where he was held after being released from Guantanamo, this time to persuade inmates not to turn to violent extremism. French prisons in particular have been pilloried as breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism. In Molenbeek, he has talked to a population of young people of immigrant backgrounds who feel cut off from mainstream Belgians. He said many in the West just think of violent punishment like beheading and cutting off hands when they hear about Islamic Sharia law. "The problem is that reality is more complicated. Sharia is above all a complete system. It's a political system, a judicial system, an entire system. Everyone has a role to play," Benchellali said at a recent round table on radicalization. "So they have a real alternative. It's not just getting married. They're being offered an entire new life when they arrive. They get a new worth." That is especially true for those already caught up in a spiral of crime, unemployment and alienation, said Steve Lambert, a Brussels lawyer linked to jihadi cases. "Carrying out an attack is an exit strategy by default, after being closed off by all the failures you've caused in your life," Lambert said. "Nothing is simple and there are no absolutes, but there has to be a solution," he added. "Every time we harden ourselves, we create new martyrs for the cause." Finding out what motivates the slide into violent extremism is crucial to instilling doubts and ultimately changing minds, as is a risk assessment, said Koehler, who has worked directly with several dozen families in six countries. The French de-radicalization sessions are conducted in rented rooms, the five participants only told the location 10 minutes in advance because, Bouzar said, Islamic State recruiters "are hounding them, trying to geo-locate us. No cellphones are allowed." In Minnesota, the program started in April with risk evaluations of Yusuf and five others who have pleaded guilty to terror charges. Koehler evaluated their level of engagement in terror activities and chances of relapsing, and the federal judge overseeing their cases will use that information and other factors to determine their sentences. Koehler will also come up with recommendations, such as counseling or mentoring, to keep these men on the right track. The judge could use those recommendations as conditions of the men's parole meaning they could be taken back into custody if they don't follow the program. In March, U.S. District Judge Michael Davis said the program could also be expanded to other terror defendants, including those being released from prison and re-entering society. The goal is to keep the community safe while helping the young men become productive members of society. Koehler will also train U.S. probation and pretrial officers, who will be responsible for supervising the defendants once they are out of prison. But on the minds of law enforcement are cases like that of a young Frenchman known as Abu Oussama, seen in extraordinary hidden camera footage captured by an undercover documentary filmmaker. Flagged to police by his father, detained in Turkey trying to reach Syria, he was imprisoned in France for five months until authorities determined he was no longer a danger, he says. Yet the young man says he is plotting an attack on his homeland. "They said since I was de-radicalized, since I was quiet..." he says, giggling toward the camera he cannot see. "It's all part of the ruse, brother."</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The Solar Impulse 2 aircraft landed in Dayton, Ohio on Saturday the latest leg of a record-breaking trip to circle the globe without consuming a drop of fuel, hours after taking off from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The solar-powered plane piloted by Swiss businessman Andre Borschberg arrived at 9.56pm (0156 GMT on Sunday) at Dayton International Airport after a flight that lasted a 16 hours and 34 minutes, aimed at promoting renewable energy, a live video feed showed. The slow-moving, single-seat plane with the wingspan of a Boeing 747 cuts a flimsy figure, but it has traversed much of the globe in stages since taking off March 9, 2015 from Abu Dhabi, with Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard alternating as pilots. The aircraft clad in thousands of solar cells, the sole source of energy for the flight, reached its destination more than an hour ahead of schedule.</text>

	<text>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE: US President Barack Obama on Sunday headed for his first visit to Vietnam, a trip aimed at sealing the transformation of an old enemy into a new partner to help counter China's growing assertiveness in the region. Four decades after the Vietnam War , Obama - the first US leader to come of age after a conflict that bitterly divided America - will seek to deepen defense and economic ties with the country's communist government while also prodding them on human rights, aides say. Pressure has mounted for Obama to use his landmark visit, which begins on Monday, to roll back a 32-year-old arms embargo on Hanoi, one of the last vestiges of wartime animosity. Lifting the ban - something Vietnam has long sought - would anger Beijing, which resents US efforts to forge stronger military bonds with its smaller neighbors at a time of rising tensions in the disputed South China Sea. But there was no immediate word of a final US decision on the issue. Vietnam's poor human rights record remains a possible sticking point, but the Obama administration appears increasingly swayed toward giving Hanoi some leeway to build its deterrent against China. "Nobody has any illusions," said Evan Medeiros, Obama's former top Asia adviser. "This trip sends important signals to China about US activism in the region and growing US concern about Chinese behavior." Closer military cooperation with allies and partners has been a major thrust of Obama's strategic "rebalance" toward the Asia-Pacific region, a centerpiece of his foreign policy. Obama's Vietnam visit comes just days after Chinese fighter jets carried out what the Pentagon said was an "unsafe" intercept of a US military reconnaissance plane in the South China Sea. Beijing is pursuing territorial claims there that conflict with those of Vietnam and several other countries. Obama will be the third consecutive US president to visit Vietnam since diplomatic relations were restored in 1995. "What we want to demonstrate with this visit is a significant upgrade in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam ... even as we have areas of difference," said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. Washington wants Vietnam to open up more on the economic front and also move closer militarily, including increased port visits by US warships, possibly with access to the strategic harbor at Cam Ranh Bay, US officials say. But even as the two sides look forward, there will be reminders of the past. Obama will be accompanied by Secretary of State John Kerry, who after a tour in Vietnam as a young Navy officer burst onto the scene as an antiwar protester in the 1970s. At the first stop of Obama's three-day visit, Hanoi, the seat of communist rule, he will meet Vietnam's new president, Tran Dai Quang, its new prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong. Obama won't be able to avoid prominently displayed images and busts of the late Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, revered by many of his compatriots but widely reviled in the United States during the war. The conflict involving US combat forces was estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and 58,000 American troops. In the country's commercial hub, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, Obama will meet entrepreneurs, a chance to tout Hanoi's role in a trans-Pacific trade pact he has championed. But the name of the city, the capital of South Vietnam during the war, evokes searing images for many Americans of a final frantic US airlift in 1975. While Vietnam wants warmer ties, some officials are suspicious that the United States seeks to undermine their one-party rule. Obama plans to meet dissidents amid US concerns about the government's heavy-handedness toward opponents. Hanoi released a Catholic priest, one of its longest-serving prisoners, on Friday, in a possible gesture ahead of Obama's visit.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama is leaving on a weeklong, 16,000-mile trip to Asia as part of his effort to pay more attention to the region and boost economic and security cooperation. He'll spend three days in Vietnam, with stops in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, for meetings with top leaders, a speech on US-Vietnam relations, visits to cultural treasures and sessions with civic leaders and entrepreneurs. From Vietnam, he heads to Japan for a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations and a historic visit to Hiroshima. Along the way, Obama will make a big push for the 12-nation trans-Pacific trade agreement, which includes the US, Vietnam and Japan. The deal is stalled in Congress, but Obama hopes it will one day increase trans-Pacific trade and make it easier for US workers and companies to compete in Asia. The deal faces strong opposition from the leading 2016 presidential candidates and other critics, who say it doesn't do enough to protect US workers from unfair competition. A key sticking point during Obama's stay in Vietnam will be human rights. Five Republican senators sent the president a letter yesterday labeling Vietnam "one of the most repressive regimes in the world" and urging Obama to press Vietnamese leaders to do more to respect freedom of religion and expression and other human rights. The letter was signed by Sens Marco Rubio of Florida, John Boozman of Arkansas, John Cornyn of Texas, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Hours before Obama's scheduled departure, Vietnam granted early release from prison to a Catholic priest who is one of its most prominent dissidents. The move is widely viewed as a goodwill gesture before the president arrives in Hanoi late tomorrow night for an official visit. The Catholic archdiocese of the central city of Hue reported on its webpage that it welcomed the return yesterday of the Rev Nguyen Van Ly from prison. Ly, 70, has served several long terms in prison or under house arrest for promoting political and religious freedoms in the communist nation. Obama's final year in office is heavy with foreign travel as he conducts what amounts to a long, global farewell tour. He's already made a historic trip to Cuba and visited Saudi Arabia, Germany and England. He's due to make a daytrip to Canada next month, attend a NATO summit in Poland in July and expected to become the first president to visit Laos in the fall. (</text>

	<text>LOS ANGELES: A giant NASA fuel tank completed its final journey on Saturday, with crowds cheering on its parade along Los Angeles streets to a science center where it will go on display with the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour. The orange tank, weighing 65,000 lb (29,500 kg) and 154 feet (47 meters) in length, is the only one of its kind. It was never used in a shuttle launch, which would have blown it to pieces. The California Science Center called the parade of the fuel tank, which stands about three stories tall when towed on its side by a truck, "ET Comes Home," in a play on the "external tank" name and the 1982 movie "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial." The tank, ET-94, arrived at the center after a 16-mile (26-km) journey, the center said on Twitter. Its arrival capped a trip that started in New Orleans aboard a barge that passed through the Panama Canal and docked at Marina del Rey on Wednesday. The transport was a sequel of sorts to the 2012 mission to tow Endeavour from the Los Angeles airport to the science center, a feat witnessed by 1.5 million. Crowds were smaller this time, but rows of spectators and children in homemade astronaut helmets lined the curbs along the route to see the tank pass and pose for selfie pictures with it. A dozen U.S. astronauts, including Garrett Reisman and Sandra Magnus, made appearances along the journey. "It's been a very smooth ride," said Science Center spokeswoman Shell Amega. The tank is longer than the Statue of Liberty from torch to the feet. But it is neither as wide nor tall as the space shuttle, allowing it to squeeze more easily through the streets of the second-largest U.S. city. At various points, light poles were swung around to allow the fuel tank to pass. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) donated the tank. It was designed to carry propellants to thrust a space shuttle into orbit and then detach before disintegrating as it fell to the ocean.</text>

	<text>NAYPYIDAW: United States secretary of state John Kerry is set to meet Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday for her new civilian government's first high level talks as Washington recalibrates its relationship with the former pariah state. The meeting comes days after the US lifted a host of financial and trade embargoes in recognition of dramatic political changes that saw landmark elections sweep Suu Kyi and her party into office after decades of junta rule. Suu Kyi, the foreign minister, also holds the newly-created position of state counsellor to enable her to steer the government despite a junta-scripted constitution that bars her from the presidency, a role now held by her longtime ally Htin Kyaw. Myanmar president's office spokesman Zaw Htay said Kerry would only meet Suu Kyi, without giving details of the topics under discussion. "He will meet the state counsellor, not the president," he told AFP, explaining that Htin Kyaw is yet to return from a summit in Russia. According to the US state department, Kerry's brief trip to Myanmar is to show "support for the new democratically-elected, civilian-led government" as well as to "further democratic and economic reforms". US President Barack Obama has made two visits to the Southeast Asian nation in recent years, seeking to widen engagement with the country as it embarked on a stunning transition towards democracy after half a century under a repressive military government. Myanmar still faces huge challenges, including decrepit infrastructure, conflicts in resource-rich borderlands, religious tensions and the continued influence of the army and junta-era cronies, who still dominate the economy. American investment in Myanmar remains relatively small compared to other nations, although some US companies including Coca-Cola and Pepsi, fast food restaurant KFC and carmakers Chevrolet and Ford have already established a sales presence. Washington rolled back many of its sanctions to reward reforms since the end of outright military rule in 2011, but retains scores of names on its blacklists as it seeks to push further changes and promote human rights. The latest sanctions rollback further eases constraints on trade. It opened up all Myanmar banks to American business, while also extending indefinitely permission made in December enabling firms to import through Myanmar's ports and airports, many of which are operated by cronies still on the blacklist.</text>

	<text>Hubballi: Panic gripped Annigeri town in Dharwad district after a BJP leader received three extortion calls demanding Rs 30 lakh, failing which he and his son would be murdered. Meanwhile, some miscreants attempt to set fire to two bikes parked in a house belonging to the leader. It is learnt the first call was received by Shivayogi Basetteppa Surakod, a former TMC member and chairman of a standing committee, at 9.30pm Thursday. He got two other calls on Friday morning. Annigeri police said Surakod was in Hubballi when he got the first call. "He neglected the threat and reached his home in Annigeri late Thursday night. When his dog started barking at 2.40am, his family members awoke and saw a person pouring petrol on bikes parked in the house. When they opened the door, the person fled in a car," they added. Surakod has said in his complaint that the caller threatened him in Hindi. "The number from which I got calls on Thursday and Friday is the same. The caller said if we fail to pay up Rs 30 lakh, he will murder me and my son," Surakod added. PSI PF Kanakannavar said a case was registered on Friday morning. The link between the threat c all and burning of bikes is yet to be ascertained, he added. Deputy SP Sharanappa Olekar and other officials visited Surakod's house and took up investigation.</text>

	<text>LUOYANG: Fifty years after Mao Zedong unleashed the decade-long Cultural Revolution to reassert his authority and revive his radical communist agenda, the spirit of modern China's founder still exerts a powerful pull. Millions of people were persecuted, publicly humiliated, beaten or killed during the upheaval, as zealous factionalism metastasized countrywide, tearing apart Chinese society at the most basic level. Student groups tortured their own teachers, and children were made to watch mobs beat parents condemned as counter-revolutionaries. Gangs engaging in "armed struggle" killed at least a half million people, while countless more, unable to cope with relentless persecution, committed suicide. It was only in 1981 - five years after Mao's death - that China's government officially pronounced the Cultural Revolution "a catastrophe". In the ancient city of Luoyang, the old, the poor and the marginalized gather daily in the main public square to profess nostalgia for the political movement, while downplaying that period's violent excesses. In the marble halls of power in Beijing, Cultural Revolution-era song-and-dance performances are being revived. China's liberals see ominous signs of a society tugged backward by ideological currents. "Either it's because people have forgotten the Cultural Revolution or are increasingly dissatisfied with social conditions, but since the mid-1990s these kinds of ideas have been gaining currency," said Xu Youyu, a former Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher. Maoists have largely embraced President Xi Jinping as one of their own, though he has never endorsed their views outright. The nuances of his personal ideology - especially on economic matters - remain a cipher. Many see encouraging echoes of Mao's political style in Xi's crusade against corrupt party bureaucrats, and in his staunchly populist rhetoric, nationalistic bent and repeated demands for ideological conformity. But the surge in Maoist sentiment and distrust of the status quo points to the complex risks facing Chinese leaders. The legitimacy of the Communist Party is staked upon both Mao's legacy and a tacit promise of bettering people's lives. Those two pillars may prove difficult to maintain as China navigates a painful economic transition that threatens to shed countless miners and factory workers and widen social inequality. While China went through similar reforms a decade ago, the economy was growing much faster at the time and citizens lacked organizational tools such as the Internet and social media platforms. Grassroots Maoism has been "blossoming in every corner" in the past few years as social media has taken off, said Han Deqiang, a prominent Maoist lecturer and professor at Beihang University in Beijing. "Many consider General Secretary Xi Jinping a leftist, so we are certainly rising, even if we cannot vote or demonstrate under the Chinese system," Han said.</text>

	<text>HONG KONG: Hong Kong student pro-democracy leader Joshua Wong was among five protesters detained on Thursday after they ran onto a motorway to intercept the motorcade of a top Chinese official during a highly-charged visit to the city. Their bid came on the final day of a three-day trip by Zhang Dejiang, who chairs China's communist-controlled legislature, where frustrated protesters have been kept out of sight behind barricades in a security lockdown. Zhang's visit is the first by such a senior official for four years and comes as concerns grow that freedoms are under threat in semi-autonomous Hong Kong as China tightens its grip. Police chased the group of five protesters as they ran along a major highway in eastern Hong Kong which had been cleared for Zhang, with Wong carrying a sign calling for "self-determination". The group were detained before Zhang's motorcade emerged from the motorway tunnel. The protesters were all members of Demosisto, a political party led by Wong, who became the face of major pro-democracy rallies in 2014. A video posted on the party's Facebook page showed the group being chased on foot and pinned to the ground by traffic police. "(Protesters) rushed out near the tunnel front to voice out the demand of self determination and the anger of people against the interference of the Chinese government," Demosisto's Agnes Chow said in a statement. Demosisto confirmed five of its members, including Wong and fellow high-profile young activists Nathan Law and Oscar Lai, were detained by police after the incident. Hong Kong police had no immediate comment. Zhang's visit was ostensibly for an economic conference, but has been widely seen as a conciliatory effort after frustration over lack of political reform sparked a fledgling independence movement, condemned by authorities in both Hong Kong and mainland China. During the trip, Zhang sought to reassure Hongkongers the city would not be "mainlandized" but hit back at activists calling for more autonomy, labelling them separatists.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: China is deploying more troops on the border with India while modernizing its nuclear force and improving its strike capabilities, the Pentagon has said, even as the Obama administration challenged Beijing's assertion that New Delhi does not meet the criteria to be a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The state department, referring to Obama's statement in 2015, said India "meets missile technology control regime requirements and is ready for NSG membership". The shadow play between Washington, Beijing, and New Delhi was very much in evidence on Friday as the US defence establishment highlighted China's growing military strength in the region, ostensibly with an eye on courting India as a strategic counterweight. "We have noticed an increase in capability and force posture by the Chinese military in areas close to the border with India ," US deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia Abraham Denmark said during a news conference after Pentagon submitted its annual 2016 report to the US Congress on 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'. "It's difficult to say how much of this is driven by internal considerations to maintain internal stability, and how much of it is an external consideration." But as far as Washington is concerned, he added, it would continue to enhance bilateral engagement with India "not in the China context but because India is an increasingly important player" by itself. "We are going to engage India because of its value," Denmark said. Beijing increasing military presence A series of reports and remarks from Washington amid continuing tensions with China is coming just ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit alongside India's own issues with Beijing, notably its use of Pakistan to needle India on issues such as terrorism and access to advanced nuclear technology. But in a report to the US Congress, the Pentagon warned of China's increasing military presence including bases in various parts of the world, in particular Pakistan  with which it has a "longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests". China's expanding international economic interests are increasing demands for the PLA Navy (PLAN) to operate in more distant seas to protect Chinese citizens, investments, and critical sea lines of communication, it said, adding, "China most likely will seek to establish additional naval logistics hubs in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and a precedent for hosting foreign militaries." READ ALSO: Indian, Chinese armies resolve to maintain peace in border meet The US navy itself is now working even more closely with the Indian Navy , outlining the emerging contours of efforts to dominate the sea lanes in the Indian Ocean through which some 60% of the world's energy trade passes. Meanwhile, Washington also endorsed India's claim for a membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group that the China-Pakistan axis has been thwarting . "I'd point you back to what the President said during his visit to India in 2015, where he reaffirmed that the US view was that India meets missile technology control regime requirements and is ready for NSG membership," State Department spokesman John Kirby said when asked about reports about Beijing and Islamabad joining hands to stall India's NSG membership. China has claimed that many members of the 48-nation NSG share its view that signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is an "important" standard for the group's expansion, an assertion that Washington does not agree with. The western world's support for India's membership is based in part on its sterling non-proliferation record, which Pakistan, as a rogue proliferator, and China as an illegal enabler, cannot match. All these issues are being thrashed out in private ahead of PM Modi's visit to Washington on June 7-8 in what promises to be one of the most consequential visits by an Indian leader to the US.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: President Pranab Mukherjee will visit China from May 24 to 27 during which he will hold talks with the top Chinese leadership, the foreign ministry here said on Wednesday, announcing the first trip to the country by an Indian Head of State in six years. Mukherjee will be visiting China at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Mukherjee will arrive in the highly industrialized Chinese city Guangzhou on May 24. The city has strong business links with India. Besides interacting with the Indian community, which has over 3,000 businessmen, Mukherjee will also address India- China Business Forum to highlight the investment opportunities in India. Top Chinese officials of the province are expected to attend the event. A number of Indian and Chinese businessmen are also expected to take part in the event, official sources said. Later, he will arrive in Beijing on May 25 and attend a reception hosted by The Chinese People's Friendship Association for Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). On May 26, he will address a meeting at the Peking University and later hold talks with Xi and also meet Premier Li Keqiang along with other Chinese leaders before leaving for home on May 27. Mukherjee's visit would set off a series of high-level visits between the two countries as they seek to deepen bilateral engagement despite differences like China's attempts block India's bid at the UN to get JeM chief Masood Azhar banned. The President's visit, which is a reciprocal visit to Xi's trip to India in 2014, will be followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Chinese city of Hangzhou to take part in the G20 leaders summit to be held on September 4 and 5 this year. Xi is expected to travel to India to take part in the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) summit scheduled to be held in Goa from October 15-16 this year. Modi had made a high-profile visit to China last year.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: China on Thursday rejected US claims that its fighter jets maneuvered unsafely when they intercepted an American Navy reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea , and demanded that the US end such missions close to the Chinese territory. The Chinese jets monitored the US plane from an acceptable distance and operated in a safe and professional manner, foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists at a regularly scheduled news briefing. "According to the related Chinese authorities, the US allegation is not true,'' Hong said. Frequent reconnaissance missions by US Navy vessels' aircraft off the Chinese coast "jeopardizes China's sea and air safety,'' Hong said. "We urge the US to immediately stop spying activities and prevent such events from happening again,'' he said. The Pentagon said two Chinese J-11 fighters flew within about 15 meters (50 feet) of the US EP-3 Aries aircraft on Tuesday, forcing the US pilot to descend sharply to avoid a collision. It said the US plane was conducting routine operations in international airspace. Chinese jets fly close to US spy planes, says Pentagon Two Chinese tactical aircraft carried out an "unsafe" intercept of a US military aircraft on May 17, the Pentagon said. The incident took place in "international airspace" as the US maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft carried out "a routine US patrol" in the South China Sea, the statement said. It characterized the incident as an unsafe intercept and said it is being reviewed. The US has sought to prevent such confrontations through frequent communication and the signing of an agreement on handling unexpected encounters at sea and in the air. However, such incidents may now be on the increase as the US challenges China's claims that its newly created artificial islands in the South China Sea enjoy legal rights to territorial seas and airspace. China says it is entitled to keep watch over such airspace and seas. China has long been irked by US reconnaissance missions off the Chinese island province of Hainan, which sits at the northern end of the South China Sea and is home to a number of highly sensitive naval and air installations. In 2001, a collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a US surveillance plane in which the Chinese pilot was killed and the American crew detained on Hainan led to a crisis in US-China relations.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: China's defense ministry criticized a US report assessing its island-building efforts in the South China Sea , saying it "hyped up" China's so-called military threat. The US Defense Department's annual report on China's military activities had "wilfully distorted China's national defense policy," said ministry spokesman Yang Yujun, adding that the US was too suspicious. China expressed its "strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition" to the Pentagon report , Yang said. He added,"China follows a national defense policy that is defensive in nature." He further informed,"China's deepening military reforms and its strengthening of weapons and equipment building are aimed at maintaining sovereignty, security and territorial integrity and guaranteeing China's peaceful development." The report to the US Congress on Friday said that China was focused on developing and weaponizing the islands it has built in the disputed waters of the South China Sea so it will have greater control over the maritime region without resorting to armed conflict. It accused China of "increasingly assertive efforts to advance its national sovereignty and territorial claims" and a lack of transparency about its growing military capabilities that are causing tensions with other countries in the region. Yang said that it was the United States that had been "frequently sending military aircraft and warships to the South China Sea to make a show of force."</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Asking the US to respect the efforts by China and India to resolve their boundary dispute peacefully, a top Chinese official on Monday said the two nations are wise enough to deal with it after the Pentagon accused Beijing of deploying more troops along the Sino-India borders . "The Chinese side is committed to safeguarding peace and tranquility of the border areas between China and India and resolving the boundary question through negotiation with India," the Chinese foreign ministry said in a written response to PTI here about a Pentagon report alleging that Beijing has increased defence capabilities and deployed more troops along the borders with India. The US military report also warned of increasing Chinese military presence in various parts of the world, particularly in Pakistan. "China and India are wise and capable enough to deal with this issue. It is hoped that other country would respect efforts made by China and India for the peaceful settlement of dispute, rather than the opposite," the foreign ministry said, apparently referring to the US. Now, high-end SUVs for quick movement of Indian troops at China border ITBP DG said while the force has several types of four-wheelers, including those with 4x4 drive facility for high-altitude driving at its border locations, SUV platforms, which are powered by diesel-run heavy-duty engines were required for quick movement in these mountainous areas. Villagers along China-India border receive suspicious calls from 'spies' US deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia Abraham M Denmark had said that "we have noticed an increase in capability and force posture by the Chinese military in areas close to the border with India." "It is difficult to conclude on the real intention behind this," Denmark said on Saturday after submitting Pentagon's annual 2016 report to the US Congress on 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'. "It is difficult to say how much of this is driven by internal considerations to maintain internal stability, and how much of it is an external consideration," he said in response to a question on China upgrading its military command in Tibet. On Sunday, the Chinese defence ministry expressed "strong dissatisfaction" and "firm opposition" to the Pentagon report which also alleged that China is focusing on the militarisation of the artificial islands built by it in the disputed waters of the South China Sea in a bid to assert its control. Skirting any references to allegations of increasing troops presence along the Sino-India border, the defence ministry accused the Pentagon's annual report as misrepresentation of China's military development.</text>

	<text>CAM RANH BAY, Vietnam  The ghosts of the Vietnam War have finally faded at the strategic port of Cam Ranh Bay. More than 40 years ago, US forces left this massive base where Marines landed, B-52s loaded up for bombing raids, and wounded US soldiers were treated. Now, some Vietnamese say they are yearning for the US military to return. "On Facebook, there was a question recently: What do you want from President Obama's visit?" said Vo Van Tao, 63, who fought as a young North Vietnamese infantry soldier against the United States. "Some people said they wanted democracy. I said I wanted the Americans to come back to Cam Ranh Bay. A lot of people agreed with me." President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive Sunday in Vietnam, the third visit by a US president since the war ended. The big question he is expected to answer is whether Washington will lift a partial arms embargo and allow Vietnam to buy lethal weapons from the United States. The Communist government has long asked for the ban to be revoked, and US access to Cam Ranh Bay could be part of the payoff. For the White House, the decision on lifting the embargo has come down to a debate over trying to improve Vietnam's poor human rights record versus enabling Vietnam to better defend itself against an increasing threat from China in the South China Sea. Washington has for years made lifting the ban contingent on Vietnam's improving human rights for its people, and has prodded Vietnam to allow more freedom of speech and to release political prisoners. But as tensions with China have escalated in the South China Sea, the sentiment in the Obama administration has shifted toward lifting the ban, American officials familiar with the discussions said. Vietnam's government, pressed by an ever more powerful China, knows it cannot stand up to Beijing alone and is cautiously moving toward increased ties with the United States. Despite their shared communist ideology, Vietnam and China fought over islands in the South China Sea in the 1970s and '80s. Two years ago, China sent an oil rig into disputed waters close to the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both countries, leading to clashes at sea and anti-Chinese riots in Vietnamese cities. More recently, China has built artificial islands with military runways in the South China Sea just 300 miles from the Vietnamese coast. Vietnam's needs dovetail with those of the United States, which has been encouraging maritime states in Southeast Asia to better defend themselves, an effort partly aimed at keeping the United States from being dragged into a direct naval conflict with China. The prospect of access to Cam Ranh Bay, where the Vietnamese have built a new international port, provides another enticement for lifting the ban. A US presence there would allow US forces to use the port on the western edge of the South China Sea, complementing US facilities in the Philippines on the sea's eastern edge. "If the United States can get regular access to Cam Ranh Bay, it would be very advantageous to maintaining the balance of power with China," said Alexander L. Vuving, a Vietnam specialist at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. "If something happens in the South China Sea, it takes a while for the US to get there. China can get there more quickly." The Vietnamese, who shun alliances and forbid foreign bases, have made clear they would not entertain exclusive use of the facilities by the United States but would allow it to share the base with others. Singaporean and Japanese vessels this year were the first to use the facility. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured Hanoi during a recent visit to Vietnam that Washington was not seeking a base here. Lifting the embargo would go a long way toward shoring up Washington's credibility among conservatives in the Vietnamese military who fear the Obama administration sees improved relations as a way to bring multiparty democracy to Vietnam, experts said. "To get over the resistance of the Vietnamese military, the US has to show its good intentions by lifting the arms embargo," Vuving said. Doing so would "open the door" to closer military cooperation, he said, and access to Cam Ranh Bay would most likely follow. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a Senate hearing last month that he favored lifting the embargo. But the human rights side of the equation remains problematic for a country Human Rights Watch describes as one of the world's most repressive. Last week, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Tom Malinowski, met with human rights leaders and government officials in Hanoi for a final human rights assessment before the Obama visit. The State Department said he urged Hanoi to "release political prisoners without condition" and make other human rights improvements. Vietnam still has more than 100 political prisoners, activists here say, including bloggers and lawyers whose only crime was to criticize the government. A US official who was briefed on the visit said there had been positive signals from the Vietnamese. Blinken had praised the government in a speech last month for "some progress" on human rights, notably allowing independent trade unions for the first time. Surprisingly, a leading dissident has come out in favor of lifting the arms embargo, telling Malinowski the issue should not be linked to the release of political prisoners. "If Obama lifts the embargo totally that would be great for Vietnam and Vietnam-US relations," said Nguyen Quang A, the founder of the Civil Society Forum in Hanoi. "The Communists say the US needs to respect our legitimacy and don't make trouble. That's the negative from our point of view. But the positive is it starts a new era with the United States." Lifting the embargo is not expected to produce a windfall for US defense suppliers. Since Washington partly lifted the embargo in 2014, allowing the purchase of nonlethal equipment for maritime defense, Vietnam has not acquired any US equipment, not even coastal radar systems for its coast guard, said Carl Thayer, a defense analyst in Canberra, Australia, who specializes in Vietnam. This was largely for lack of money, he said. It would also be costly for Vietnam to switch from heavy equipment made in Russia, long Vietnam's main arms supplier, to US-made equipment. But Vietnam wants to diversify from its reliance on Russian arms. It is using India to train its crews on Russian-built submarines, and is looking to Israel for some weapons. Last week, Vietnamese officials met with US military suppliers, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, at a symposium in Hanoi to discuss the needs of the Vietnamese military. Christopher Sfedu, who attended the meeting and is director of international expansion for EDI-USA, a Philadelphia-based supplier of communications equipment, said communications software appeared to be near the top of the military's wish list. The Russians still have privileged rights at Cam Ranh Bay, using the base for tanker aircraft that refuel reconnaissance flights over Guam. Protected on its southern and eastern flanks by hills looming up from the South China Sea, Cam Ranh Bay juts inland for 20 miles, the largest sheltered harbor in Southeast Asia, and its most strategic because of its deep water. For Tao, a local resident, the return of the Americans cannot happen fast enough. "The Vietnamese people are very angry at the Chinese airstrips in the Spratlys," he said, referring to the disputed islands in the South China Sea. "We figured out it will take them only one hour to come and bomb Saigon."</text>

	<text>China's government fabricates about 488 million social media comments a year - nearly the same as one day of Twitter's total global volume - in a massive effort to distract its citizens from bad news and sensitive political debates, according to a study. Three scholars led by Gary King, a political scientist at Harvard University who specialises in using quantitative data to analyse public policy, ran the first systematic study of China's online propaganda workers, known as the Fifty Cent Party because they are popularly believed to be paid by the government 50 Chinese cents for every social media post. Contrary to popular perception inside China, the Fifty Cent Party avoids engaging in debates with critics and doesn't make fun of foreign governments. Instead, it mostly works to distract public attention away from hot topics by highlighting the positive, cheering the state, symbols of the regime, or the Communist Party's revolutionary past. Although those who post comments are often rumored to be ordinary citizens, the researchers were surprised to find that nearly all the posts were written by workers at government agencies including tax and human resource departments, and at courts. The team based their findings on leaked archives of 2013 and 2014 e-mails from the Internet Propaganda Office of Zhanggong, a county-level district of nearly half a million people in Ganzhou City, in Jiangxi, a province in southeast China King and his team pulled out 2,341 e-mails of which more than half contained a Fifty Cent post, totaling 43,797 posts that formed a benchmark for identifying other propaganda posts. They were able to identify Fifty Centers by cross referencing names from leaked e-mails with online social media profiles.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Pakistan's powerful army chief Gen Raheel Sharif met top Chinese leadership here and assured them to provide full security to the ambitious $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through restive Balochistan province. General Sharif, who is in China on a two-day official visit, on Monday met Premier Li Keqiang and vice President of the Central Military Commission Fan Changlong, the highest military official of the People's Liberation Army which is headed by President Xi Jinping. During his meeting with Li, Sharif appreciated Pakistan's profound friendship with China and stressed that the Pakistani side expects achievements from the CPEC and is ready to provide security for cooperation. General Sharif discussed with Chinese officials the measures to improve military cooperation, exponentially enhance training exchanges, defence technology and intelligence sharing and security of the CPEC, Pakistan military spokesman Lt Gen Asim Bajwa said. Li met Sharif to enhance bilateral economic and security ties, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported today. Military-to-military relations have reinforced China-Pakistan ties, especially economic cooperation, Li said, calling on both sides to strengthen high-level contact and deepen exchanges in various fields. The economic corridor is not only a flagship project between the two sides, but also conducive to development and prosperity of the whole region, Li said. Pakistan is readying a special force of 4,000 security personnel to protect Chinese nationals working at various projects in Punjab province, including the CPEC project. Already over 17,000 security personnel from the army and other security forces have been engaged to ensure foolproof security of Chinese nationals working across the country. The ambitious 3,000-kilometre CPEC project was launched last year to link western China to southern Pakistan through a network of roads, railways and pipelines. Sharif's trip to Beijing followed last month's visit of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar who held extensive talks with top Chinese leaders and military officials. His visit comes in the backdrop of assertions by Pakistan that it will raise its concerns at the international level over India's successful test of supersonic interceptor missile. Expressing concern over India's interceptor missile test, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz said it will disturb the balance of power in the region. He added that Pakistan will continue to upgrade its defensive capabilities by acquiring advanced technology. India is enjoying the cooperation of the US, as Washington thinks a strong New Delhi is vital to contain China, he was quoted as saying by the Dawn. Pakistan would raise its voice at the international level against these developments, Aziz said.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: As China's strongest critic Tsai Ing-wen assumed power in Taiwan on Friday and pledged democracy and close ties with the US, a wary BEIJING warned her against seeking independence and said the 'One-China policy' remained the corner-stone of its relations with other countries. Tsai, 59, took the oath as the new President of Taiwan in Taipei . She is the head of the Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates Taiwan's independence from the mainland. "Once again, the people of Taiwan have shown the world through our actions that we, as a free and democratic people, are committed to the defence of our freedom and democracy as a way of life," Tsai said in her address after taking oath. Referring to Taiwan's ties with China, the island's first female President said the "stable and peaceful development of the cross-Strait relationship must be continuously promoted". She called on on both sides to "set aside the baggage of history, and engage in positive dialogue, for the benefit of the people on both sides." According to experts what Tsai said in her speech is unlikely to satisfy Beijing. It sees eventual unification with the island as non-negotiable. With tensions rising in the South China Sea, Beijing is keen for Taiwan to be its ally rather than be aligned with rival claimants to the disputed islets in the sea. "If 'independence' is pursued, it will be impossible to have peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits," the Taiwan Affairs Office said hours after Tsai was sworn in. "Independence is the greatest disaster for the peaceful development of peace in the Taiwan straits and the peaceful development of cross-straits relations." Commenting on Tsai's swearing in, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chun Ying said, "I want to emphasis that 'One China policy' is widely recognised by the world and one-China principle is important corner stone and prerequisite for China to develop relations with other countries. What ever political changes Taiwan may go through, the Chinese government will remain unchanged in sticking to the One-China principle and oppose the Taiwan independence or one China or one Taiwan." While refraining from any critical remarks against Tsai, Hua reacted guardedly to her remarks to raise the profile of Taiwan by improving trade ties with democratic countries like the US and Japan, which Beijing considers as rivals. "With regard to foreign relations between Taiwan and other countries the one-China policy is a prerequisite and basis for relations China and other counties," she said. "We have no objection to Taiwan's unofficial trade relations with other countries. We are opposed to other countries signing official agreements with Taiwan. For any trade arrangements they should be discussed through pragmatic cooperation between the two parts." Tsai was elected after strongly opposing the Beijing-friendly policy of outgoing President Ma Ying-jeou. With her coming to power, concerns have arisen in China about future course attempts to normalise cross straits relations. China and Taiwan split in 1949. But Beijing has always seen the island as a rebel province awaiting reunification.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON/BEIJING: Beijing demanded an end to US surveillance near China on Thursday after two of its fighter jets carried out what the Pentagon said was an "unsafe" intercept of a US military reconnaissance aircraft over the South China Sea . The incident, likely to increase tension in and around the contested waterway, took place in international airspace on Tuesday as the plane carried out "a routine US patrol," a Pentagon statement said. A US defense official said two Chinese J-11 fighter jets flew within 50 feet (15 meters) of the US EP-3 aircraft. The official said the incident took place east of Hainan island. "Initial reports characterized the incident as unsafe," the Pentagon statement said. "It must be pointed out that US military planes frequently carry out reconnaissance in Chinese coastal waters, seriously endangering Chinese maritime security," China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei Hong told reporters. "We demand that the United States immediately cease this type of close reconnaissance activity to avoid having this sort of incident happening again," Hong said. Speaking at a regular press briefing, he described the Pentagon statement as "not true" and said the actions of the Chinese aircraft were "completely in keeping with safety and professional standards." "They maintained safe behavior and did not engage in any dangerous action," Hong said. The encounter comes a week after China scrambled fighter jets as a US Navy ship sailed close to a disputed reef in the South China Sea. Another Chinese intercept took place in 2014 when a Chinese fighter pilot flew acrobatic maneuvers around a US spy plane. The intercept occurred days before President Barack Obama travels to parts of Asia from May 21-28, including a Group of Seven summit in Japan and his first trip to Vietnam. China claims most of the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have overlapping claims. Washington has accused Beijing of militarizing the South China Sea after creating artificial islands, while Beijing, in turn, has criticized increased US naval patrols and exercises in Asia. The Pentagon statement said the Department of Defense was addressing the issue through military and diplomatic channels. China's defense ministry said in a fax that it was looking into reports on the incident. "Dangerous intercepts" In 2015, the United States and China announced agreements on a military hotline and rules of behavior to govern air-to-air encounters called the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES). "This is exactly the type of irresponsible and dangerous intercepts that the air-to-air annex to CUES is supposed to prevent," said Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. Poling said either some part of China's air force "hadn't gotten the message," or it was meant as a signal of displeasure with recent US freedom of navigation actions in the South China Sea. "If the latter, it would be very disappointing to find China sacrificing the CUES annex for political gamesmanship." Zhang Baohui, a security expert at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, said he believed the encounter highlighted the limitation of CUES, and shows that Chinese pilots would still fly close to US surveillance planes if needed. "Frankly, we're always going to see these kinds of incidents as China will always put the priority on national security over something like CUES whenever it feels its interests are directly threatened," he said. The encounter took place in international airspace about 100 nautical miles south of mainland China and about 50 nautical miles east of Hainan island, a Pentagon spokesman said in a statement issued later on Thursday. Regional military attaches and experts say the southern Chinese coast is a military area of increasing sensitivity for Beijing. Its submarine bases on Hainan are home to an expanding fleet of nuclear-armed submarines and a big target for on-going Western surveillance operations. The Guangdong coast is also believed to be home to some of China's most advanced missiles, including the DF-21D anti-ship weapon. The Pentagon last month called on China to reaffirm it has no plans to deploy military aircraft in the Spratly Islands after China used a military plane to evacuate sick workers from Fiery Cross Reef, where it has built a 9,800-foot (3,000 meter) runway. In April 2001, an intercept of a US spy plane by a Chinese fighter jet resulted in a collision that killed the Chinese pilot and forced the American plane to make an emergency landing at a base on Hainan. The 24 US air crew members were held for 11 days until Washington apologized for the incident. That encounter soured US-Chinese relations in the early days of President George W Bush's first administration. Last month, the Pentagon said that Russia had intercepted a US Air Force aircraft over the Baltic Sea in an "unsafe and unprofessional" way.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: As many as 53 people were killed and 16 others listed missing in natural disasters across China last month which affected more than 5.6 million people and caused direct economic losses of about $550 million. The disasters included drought, earthquakes, floods, forest fires, gales and hail, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday, citing a Ministry of Civil Affairs statement released on Friday. They caused about 3.6 billion yuan (about $550 million) in direct economic losses, it said. More than 53,000 people had to be relocated, 28,000 of whom needed emergency assistance, while about 6,000 houses collapsed, mostly in southern regions hit by floods, the report said. Overall damage was generally less than in the same period last year, during which 68 people were killed.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: An extremely rare round of heavy torrential rainfall stated to be once in more than 200 years has lashed a Chinese city in Guangdong province in which eight people were killed and four others listed missing. Xinyi, a small, county-level city in Maoming received 429.5 millimetres of rainfall in just six hours, according to the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters. Eight people died and four others were reportedly missing in Xinyi. The provincial civil affairs department has declared the second highest state of emergency and dispatched working teams to Xinyi. Relief supplies including 200 tents and 10 tonnes of rice have been sent to the disaster-hit areas, state run Xinhua news agency reported. The rainstorm abated yesterday afternoon and stopped in the evening. But local authorities still warned of geological disasters in mountainous area.</text>

	<text>TAIPEI: Tsai Ing-wen was sworn in as Taiwan's first woman president on Friday, with the export-driven economy on the ropes and wary Communist Party rulers in China watching for any move towards independence by an island it considers its own. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won parliamentary and presidential elections by a landslide in January on voter backlash against creeping dependence on China. The DPP, which has traditionally favoured independence from China, takes over after eight years under China-friendly Nationalist Ma Ying-jeou. Wearing a cream blazer with dark trousers, Tsai pledged to defend the country and abide by the constitution of the Republic of China, Taiwan's formal name, as she took the oath of office, which was carried on live TV broadcast. "The favourable interaction will be broken," said Chang An-lo, a pro-unification leader, rallying about 400 supporters outside the DPP headquarters this week. Taiwan's main index was up a bit in cautious trade ahead of her speech. It slid to over three month lows last week with foreign investors net selling shares this month so far on political and economic worries. The trade-reliant economy, which counts China as its biggest trading partner, is struggling to shake off last year's recession as prolonged weakness in global demand weighs on Asian exporters. China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. It is deeply distrustful of the DPP, whose charter includes a clause promoting "a sovereign and independent Republic of Taiwan". Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communists in China in 1949. China has pressured the new Taiwan government to stick to the "one-China" principle agreed with the Nationalists. That allows each side to interpret what "one China" means. The Communists say they rule all of China including Taiwan, while the Nationalists maintain Taipei is the ruler. Tsai has said she will maintain the status quo, but stops short of referring to "one China". During the inauguration ceremony, performers will pay tribute to demonstrations that have been key to the DPP's rise, including the 2014 Sunflower Movement protests. The DPP is distrustful of growing economic dependence on China and champions Taiwan's own history. Tsai, partly of aboriginal descent, will take the stage in front of the presidential office, a life-size replica of which Taiwan has said has been built in China and used for attack practice. "We have emphasized ... our hope that both sides will continue to show flexibility going forward in the name of maintaining peace and stability," said Daniel Kritenbrink, senior director for Asian Affairs at the White House's National Security Council, earlier this week. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but is also Taiwan's biggest ally and arms supplier.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The concluding sessions of the Indo-US workshop on air pollution on Wednesday ended with heated exchange of words. Ranged on two sides were Sunita Narain, head of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and some experts from the US. The verbal duel broke out after one of the experts suggested that the state that burns crop stubble, contributing to air pollution can be sued for doing so. But both agreed on a stringent strategy that ensures accountability needed to reduce air pollution levels. Narain said many participants at the workshop were acting like India has just realized that there is an air pollution problem. "If you want to work here, you have to respect the action that is already happening here. The reason farmers in Punjab and Haryana burn crop stubble is because there are no economic incentives to stop burning. They don't have machinery that will allow them to bail it and plough it back. Please don't lecture us unless you are sensitive to the challenges here," Narain said, adding that "local and global pollution are intrinsically linked. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector in US is increasing. You can help us fix local and we can work together to fix the global problem," she said. During the group discussion to arrive at final recommendations, participants discussed if India could have policy where state governments are given deadlines to meet air quality standards . If they failed to meet the deadlines, they could be penalized by withholding central funds for various projects. US has a similar policy and experts suggested that India could also implement such a system but it would require suitable legislation to enforce such a plan. Laki Tisopulos of South Coast Air Quality Management District (SQAMD), one of the panelists said Indian air pollution control agency is not strong and policy "way too dispersed." The way ahead could be to empower the central pollution control board (CPCB) with necessary resources and set deadlines or clean air targets to the existing national air quality monitoring programme (NAMP). There could also be a third party verification to the process. "It will take legislative action to do this," he added. Some participants in the audience said such a policy may be difficult in India considering that political systems are very different in every state here. "Each country has to devise their own pathway. But if there is a time frame people start taking it seriously," Tisopilos added. Narain said such a system already exsists in India but implementation is poor. She spoke about the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) which classifies different parts of the country based on pollution, toxicity and other parameters and series of interventions kick in based on the ranking, like no further projects will be allowed in areas ranking the worst. "But the data available was very poor so even decision making has been poor. We don't have a full proof way of finding out whether the interventions are working," Narain said. Narain told TOI that she agrees in principle with the US model where investments are cut down to an area that is highly polluted. "It forces accountability. It is a good model but we need to have basics in place." C Arden Pope III, economist from the Brigham Young University said it was critical to acknowledge that "combustion sources like coal burning, diesel exhaust, transportation are driving the health effects." IIT Kanpur professor, Mukesh Sharma cited a study published in Nature to say that combustion sources are six times more harmful than crustal particles like dust. US embassy officials told TOI that following the announcement of an agreement to cooperate on air pollution during President Obama's visit to India last January, the North India office of the embassy had requested for proposals to carry forward the agreement. Research Triangle Institute (RTI), North Carolina was selected to organize the workshops and a grant was given to them. "The recommendations will be consolidated and then used to move forward on air pollution control. We are open to criticism and different views in the forum," they said. The embassy will also start debates on climate change in various Indian universities soon. US embassy tries to keep dirty air away: Some Indian participants took exception to US embassy's claims that it is trying to ensure that polluted air from outside doesn't enter the embassy premises by insulating it and making certain changes in the architecture, while some others felt it was scientific and smart. Liam Fitzgerald, Resource Conservation Unit, US Embassy made a presentation on how the embassy in its various offices has put in place systems to identify leaks in the "building envelope of residences and offices" and residences are tested for rate of leakage. He also said about a million dollars have been invested in the air quality control program for offices and residences of staff in India. Their maintenance programme also includes inspection to uncover or unblock any fresh air ducts in the buildings.</text>

	<text>UNITED NATIONS: Nearly 40 million Indians will be at risk from rising sea levels by 2050, with people in Mumbai and Kolkata having the maximum exposure to coastal flooding in future due to rapid urbanisation and economic growth, according to a UN environment report. The Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-6): Regional Assessments said that the worst impacts of climate change are projected to occur in the Pacific and South and Southeast Asia. It said focusing on the population at risk from sea level rise by 2050, seven of the 10 most vulnerable countries worldwide are in the Asia Pacific region. India tops the chart with nearly 40 million people in the country projected to be at risk from rising sea levels, followed by more than 25 million in Bangladesh, over 20 million in China and nearly 15 million in the Philippines. It said that changes in settlement patterns, urbanisation and socio-economic status in Asia have influenced observed trends in vulnerability and exposure to climate extremes. The report said that in many coastal areas, growing urban settlements have also affected the ability of natural coastal systems to respond effectively to extreme climate events, rendering them more vulnerable. "Some countries, such as China, India and Thailand, are projected to face increased future exposure to extremes, especially in highly urbanised areas, as a result of rapid urbanisation and economic growth," it said. It listed Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guangzhou and Shanghai in China, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Yangon in Myanmar, Bangkok in Thailand, and Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong in Vietnam as projected to have the largest population exposure to coastal flooding in 2070. "Many of these cities are already exposed to coastal flooding, but have limited capacity to adapt due to their fixed location," it said. The report, published ahead of the UN Environment Assembly taking place in Nairobi next week, said the worst impacts of climate change are projected to occur in the Pacific and South and Southeast Asia. In 2011, six of the ten countries most vulnerable to climate change worldwide were in Asia and the Pacific. The report said livelihoods can be impacted negatively by natural disasters, economic crises and climate change. On coastal areas highly exposed to cyclones and typhoons the poor tend to be more exposed to natural disasters because they live on hazardous land. Evidence suggests that climate change and climate variability and sea-level rise will exacerbate multi-dimensional poverty in most developing countries. By 2050, areas of storm surge zones are expected for Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, with a combined total of over 58 million people at risk.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Terming the latest WHO report on air pollution "misleading", environment minister Prakash Javadekar said India would soon come out with air pollution data of major cities across the US and Europe so that people know the whole picture. He said the Centre's decision to publish pollution data of other countries was not to counter but to create awareness. Referring to the report which listed 30 Indian cities among the 100 most polluted cities in the world, Javadekar said the WHO report had not factored in various key pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and benzene while analysing air quality and wondered why western countries focused more on India and some other nations and not on themselves. The WHO report, which is based on 2012-13 data, was prepared taking into consideration PM (particulate matter) 10 and PM 2.5 and listed Delhi as the 11th most polluted city in the world. To categorise cities as polluted based on only PM 2.5 was misleading, Javadekar said, as there were eight other major pollutants which had adverse impact on health. "There is ozone pollution, benzene pollution, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide pollution among eight major pollutants. All have adverse impact on health. On each parameter, each pollutant, there are different cities in the world which are bad and good," he told a news agency in an interview on Tuesday. Expressing surprise why western countries only focused on India and some other nations and not themselves, the minister said, "Every citizen has the right to have full knowledge. PM 2.5 is not the only pollutant. There are many cities in the western countries as well which are suffering. So let citizens know that pollution problem is all over, in different categories and degrees."</text>

	<text>SYDNEY: As many as 70 crocodile heads were found dumped and left to rot in a freezer in a small town in northern Australia, media reported on Tuesday. A group of children found the freezer that had been left behind a local shop at a small town called Humpty Doo, 40 km southeast of Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), reported Xinhua. Authorities said at least 50 crocodile heads - but as many as 70 - had been stuffed inside the freezer. NT national parks and wildlife officers have joined the investigation. Crocodiles are considered a protected species in Australia and anyone convicted of killing the animal faces a fine of $55,779 or five years in jail. A limited number of permits are issued each year for local hunters to kill or remove crocodiles that pose a danger to the community. Crocodile skin is incredibly valuable in the global fashion industry.</text>

	<text>KANPUR: Soon the visitors to the Allen Forest (Kanpur zoo) will get a chance to see fox and clouded leopard. This will be for the first time that the zoo will house a fox and a different specie of a leopard. Also, visitors will be able to see chinakaras (a type of deer) and stump-tailed macaque (a kind of a monkey). These animals will come to Kanpur zoo under the animal exchange programme with other zoos in the country. While a pair of fox and two pairs of chinkaras will come from Rewari zoo in Haryana, Assam zoo will give stump-tailed macaque and leopard, one pair each. The Kanpur zoo will give one Himalayan black bear, a pair of hyena and one pair of blackbuck (a type of deer) in exchange. Talking to TOI, Kanpur zoo director Deepak Kumar said that this animal exchange with Rewari and Assam zoos has been finalised and the acceptance from principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) Rupak De has been received. He said both the zoos have also agreed to give us our demanded animals. Kanpur zoo will soon house a fox and clouded leopard for the first time. He said that now the acceptance for exchange is to be sought from Central Zoo Authority (CZA) for which application has been moved. On being asked when will these animals will reach Kanpur zoo, Kumar said that it may take 15-30 days for the acceptance from CZA and the transfer of animals to take place. The clouded leopard is a cat which has been classified as Vulnerable in 2008 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its total population size is suspected to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with a decreasing population trend, and no single population numbering more than 1,000 adults.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Giving a major fillip to its Ganga rejuvenation efforts, the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) - a central body to implement the government's Namami Gange scheme - has approved projects worth Rs 2446 crore for development of 'ghats' and crematoriums at various places along the river in four states and along its tributary Yamuna in Delhi. The projects will be implemented along the river stretch from Haridwar to Uttarakhand border, Garhmukteshwar in Uttar Pradesh, Buxar, Hajipur and Sonepur in Bihar, Sahibganj, Rajmahal and Kanhaiya 'ghat' in Jharkhand. "These projects have been carved to improve the facilities of 'ghats' and crematoria for reduction of pollution into the river. All the projects will be implemented under centrally sponsored scheme of Namami Gange. The central government will bear 100% costs", said an official statement. All these projects were approved by the Empowered Steering Committee (ESC) of the NGRBA on Tuesday. The ESC is chaired by secretary, ministry of water resources and has members from the ministries of environment and forests, finance, urban development and power and representatives from state governments of the five Ganga Basin states -- Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. The project is also meant for afforestation along the banks of river Ganga. However, additional fund of Rs 2294 crore for afforestation under 'Forestry Intervention in River Ganga' scheme of the Centre will be approved later. The ESC on Tuesday also appraised the 'Detailed Project Report' (DPR) on the 'Forestry Intervention in River Ganga'. The project will focus on augmenting water flow along with abating the pollutants in river Ganga through appropriate forestry intervention along the banks of river Ganga. The major project components are implementation of forestry interventions in five states, strengthening knowledge management and national capacity for forestry interventions and conservation of rivers and scaling up and replication of successful models of forestry interventions and riverscape. Seeking to rejuvenate the river Ganga through massive plantation exercise, the Centre had in March released the DPR on forestry intervention for the river which will see the five states to plant trees on 83,946 sq km of identified diverse forest areas over the next five years. The project, which is to be implemented during 2016-21 in its first phase with an estimated cost of over Rs 2,294 crore, will help in absorbing water and dealing with soil erosion. As many as 40 types of plants with high water retention capacity, including several shrubs of medicinal value, have been identified for this purpose. The plantation drive will be funded by the Centre under its 'Namami Gange' programme. The same model will later be replicated elsewhere in the country for water conservation through tree plantation drive. Experts believe that the plantation of trees, like walnut and oak, having high water retention capacity will increase the river's water level and enhance its flow in the long run. Plantation along the river and all over the available stretches of land in the Ganga basin is a key component of the 'Namami Gange' programme which was launched last year as a comprehensive approach to rejuvenate the river.</text>

	<text>BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh forest department is considering a proposal to fell over 550 trees to make way for a tiger safari in its Pench national park, known as home to 'Mowgli', a fictional character and protagonist in English writer Rudyard Kipling's 'The Jungle Book'. The forest department has started working on a project to create tiger safari in the park straddling Seoni and Chhindwara districts of the state. It has been proposed to erect a boundary wall which would require pruning of shrubs and felling of 556 trees, according to an order issued by Pench national park's authorities. However, the plan has got stuck for want of permission of Delhi-based National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The decision to cut 556 has, however, been criticised by wildlife activists who termed it as a violation of rules. "We are against the creation of tiger safari inside Pench national park. There has been continuous cases of tiger deaths in Madhya Pradesh. The state government instead of taking steps towards protection of tigers is trying to reduce the green cover and increasing people's activities. The NTCA must reject this plan," said Ajay Dubey, on whose petition Supreme Court had in 2010 banned tourism inside tiger reserves. Pench national park or tiger reserve is known world over as home to 'Mowgli'  a man-cub said to have been spotted there. The park, sprawling over 758 square kms, is located on the southern boundary of Madhya Pradesh, bordering Maharashtra. It has 299 sq kms core area of Indira Priyadarshini Pench national park and the Mowgli Pench Sanctuary. The remaining 464 sq km is the buffer area. There are six tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh  Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Panna, Bori-Satpura, Sanjay-Dubri and Pench  which have about 257 big cats. While the tiger population in the country was estimated at 1,706 in 2010, it had risen to 2,226 in 2014. Madhya Pradesh ranks third  after Karnataka and Uttarakhand  in tiger population in the country.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Pointing out how the work of Ganga rejuvenation is getting delayed due to multiplicity of implementing authorities, the parliamentary Committee on Estimates - chaired by the BJP Lok Sabha member Murli Manohar Joshi - on Wednesday suggested setting up an apex body, headed by the Prime Minister, for better coordination and implementation of all the schemes of the cleaning of the country's national river in a time-bound manner. The Committee suggested that the apex body should also be backed by a legislative framework with statutory power to take decisions on all aspects of river rejuvenation projects -- whether it is land acquisition for sewage treatment plants, maintaining uninterrupted flow of the river or regulation of water withdrawal for industrial, agriculture and domestic use. Speaking on the report of the Committee on Estimates (2015-16), Joshi also flagged as to how construction of dams has become a major stumbling block to the river cleaning exercise as it had affected the natural flow (ecological flow having self-cleaning properties) of the river and suggested that the government should not go ahead with any hydro-power project till the Supreme Court takes a call on the issue. "Damming of the river is quite harmful. It is accepted world over that the dams are damaging the rivers", Joshi said. He also expressed his reservation to the government's ambitious plan of inter-linking of rivers and suggested extreme caution while going ahead with the plan. Joshi, former Union minister, said rivers can be inter-linked on small scale but it is not "practical" to go for large-scale interlinking at the national level. Claiming that thousands of kilowatts of power will be required to run pump sets to lift water from one end to another, he said, "It will require power and money. We are short of power as it is...how will water cross the Malwa plateau? Imagine the number of pumping sets required". He said, had it been practical, then nature itself would have done it. "The rivers would have been inter-connected. But it is not.....Different rivers flow\located in different environments (topographical regions)...So, one should be very careful while pursuing the inter-linking plan " Joshi, however, clarified that river inter-linking is not one of the subjects of the Estimates Committee. The government has identified 30 projects of inter-linking of rivers across the country. However, only three links -- Ken-Betwa, Damanganga-Pinjal and Par-Tapi-Narmada - have been taken up for implementation. Though all necessary works have been completed for linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, the actual works on the ground have not yet started due to absence of certain environmental clearances. Speaking about the apex body on Ganga rejuvenation, Joshi said the Committee noted that the gigantic task of river cleaning cannot be accomplished through a piecemeal and fragmented approach. Specifying need for making effective amendments in various environmental laws, the Committee, having 30 MPs as its members from different political parties, recommended that the ministry of water resources should take appropriate action expeditiously so that a "strong, comprehensive and credible legislative framework is put in place envisaging, among others, the creation of an empowered overarching authority to deal with all aspects of Ganga rejuvenation and for maintaining the pristine purity of the Ganga it is revered for". Joshi said the Committee submitted its report to the Parliament with its recommendation on Wednesday. "Now, it is for the government to act upon it", he said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: International leaders and local officials on Thursday pledged to work hard to stem the rise of global temperatures by investing in public transportation and electric cars, planting trees and switching to solar energy. At a climate action summit, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon urged governments, businesses and civil society to make good on the landmark climate agreement concluded late last year in Paris by more than 170 countries. The deal aims to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius compared with preindustrial times. Ban called on cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and on companies to invest in green technologies with the goal or cooling the planet and ensuring cleaner air and better health. ``We need action now,'' Ban said. ``Temperatures continue to rise. Arctic sea ice is melting fast. Droughts, storms and floods are costing lives and productivity.'' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said governments and corporations should invest in lower-carbon transport systems and switch over from road to rail and water transport. ``Inaction means we will not meet our targets set in Paris, and the global temperature will soar above 2 degrees Celsius,'' Kim said. ``That would spell disaster for us, for our children, and for the planet.'' Earlier, the mayors of major cities around the world announced a program to share their knowledge and know-how to fight hotter temperatures, air pollution and other effects of climate change. ``It's about leadership, energy and passion that will help cool the planet,'' Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed told the conference.</text>

	<text>It's that time of the year again, when students have to make choices that will define their careers. To have many choices is wonderful but when the options are many, and several appear compelling, making an informed decision is a challenge. TOI's 'Mission Admission' guides students through the season. Today's focus: App Designing Today there is an application for anything. App design is a career worth pursuing, say experts The average time spent by an Indian on a smartphone each day is 169 minutes, says a study. And, most of this time is spent on social networking, gaming, browsing, e-mailing, and making transactions. Whether it's a smartphone or a tablet, all of these activities are possible just from one device because of the various applications (apps). Today, there is an application for almost everything, and app-designing is a career worth aspiring. In the past five-six years, the smartphone industry has evolved drastically. While development in hardware is changing rapidly, it is the software, especially the applications, that makes a smartphone more appealing. "Five years ago, app-design was more about Java games and website design. The focus was on desktop applications and utility apps. Mobile and utility apps. Mobile applications become the focus when the smartphone industry boomed and companies started conducting hackathons to recruit people," says R Nadarajan, head, department of applied mathematics and computational sciences, PSG College of Technology. App-design has many components. "There are many factors that a designer needs to consider. The target group, the aim of the app, the functionalities, its novelty, and profitability and ingenuity are to be analysed. The very thought of the general public using the app keeps any developer motivated," Nadarajan says. App design has come a long way. Today, mobile applications are an integral part of our life, as they track your movement, activities, and, at any point, provide a range of information on you, at one tap. "The apps of today are aimed at all facets of life that one can think of and the focus has been on optimisation, cost reduction and improved user experience. Integr tion of data mining and artificial intelligence have played a major a role in providing quality service to users," he says. There are apps a dealing with all facets of life like entertainment, communication, online buying, health, and money. While there are specific courses on app-design, predominantly , most courses are electives or subjects included in the curriculum of circuit engineering branches (electronics, electrical, computer science and information technology). "We have courses offered in the form of open electives to the students of various branches of engineering and technology, on Android app development and iOS n apps development. These course duration is 45 to 60 hours," the principal of Bannari Amman Institute of Technoloogy, Sathyamangalam, Erode, D Saravanan says. There are also courses offered online for beginners. "A plethora of courses are available on Udacity, Youtube, Coursera, and Lynda. Its best recommended for any beginner," Nadarajan says. Besides courses, colleges also train students on app-designing. "We organise hands-on workshops for students. There are online tutorials for students to be in touch with updated technology. And, the best part is making them participate in national and international contests," says the head of the computer science and engineering department, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, P Devaki. With over 10 billion mobile internet devices expected to be in use by 2016, the mobile app industry will grow tremendously to match the demand and keep up with ever evolving technologies, say professors. "Social networking, mobile commerce, context aware marketing, location based services, mobile payment systems and object recognition systems widen up the field's scope," says Nadarajan.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Sukriti Gupta of Montfort Senior Secondary School, a consistent performer in school, emerged the CBSE all India Topper in science stream for class 12. She says she followed NCERT and relied on self-study while preparing for her board exams. "You need to get your basics right and then the rest is not that hard to crack. I have been consistent throughout and that helped me to emerge as a topper. I did not expect this though I was sure that I would do well. This is beyond my expectations. I don't want to get carried away by the emotions at the moment as tomorrow I have JEE mains exams," Sukriti said. Sukriti believes in taking one step at a time and is yet to decide her future plans. "I was more focussed on my board exams and I take one step at a time. It is important to focus on one thing at a time to excel in life. Now that I am through my exams I will take some time out and decide what I really want to pursue. I have appeared for few engineering entrance exams and after their result I will take the final call," she added. Sukriti has scored a total of 497 out of 500. She scored 100 in Physics and Chemistry, and 99 in English, Maths and Computer Science. Born and brought up in Delhi, Sukriti followed a basic routine and never emphasised on the concept of studying for long hours. "I never studied for any specific number of hours. I focussed more on utilising those hours in doing something productive. The credit goes to my school teachers for constantly helping me out and my parents who stood by my side as the pillar of strength," said Sukriti. Her mother Renuka Gupta was a Physics topper of her batch and father Rakesh Gupta was a Rajasthan board topper. "I am feeling great. We never pushed her hard to emerge as a topper and constantly kept motivating her to do better. Now that she has topped on All India level the feeling is great," said Renuka Gupta. Unlike many students who would isolate themselves during board exams, Sukriti says she enjoyed every aspect of her life. "I used to watch TV, play games and travel even during my boards. I don't think so isolating yourself will help. You can't study all the time as it becomes tiring after certain point of time so there is a need for extra curricular activities to keep your mind fresh," she said.</text>

	<text>It's that time of the year again, when students have to make choices that will define their careers. To have many choices is wonderful but when the options are many, and several appear compelling, making an informed decision is a challenge. TOI's 'Mission Admission' guides students through the season. Today's focus: Industrial Design Ever broken a toy car to see how it actually works? Or wondered how a three-legged stool balances itself or how a bicycle moves? If you spent your childhood pondering over how things work or tearing things down, industrial or product design might be the right choice for you. Industrial designers develop concepts and designs for products. They specialise in one product category, such as automobile, furniture or housewares. While product design is often confused with industrial design, experts say product design is a sub topic. Industrial design encompasses anything man-made right from products to complete ecosystems. "With Make in India, innovation has become the buzzword and design thinking is key to innovation," said BK Chakravarthy, professor, head and institute chair professor, industrial design centre (IDC) at IIT Bombay. With technology taking centre stage in most fields, Chakravarthy says students are taught to use design thinking and problem solving skills to address users' needs. From designing a residential garbage collection device to a waterfetching aid for rural women; using ceramics and glass to design housewares; working with leather to design car seats; building an entertainment console for a vehicle; a motorcycle helmet design; design for a metro train or using animation to narrate stories -the possibilities are endless. Most colleges have an entrance exam such as the CEED which is held annually by IITs and the Indian Institute of Science. The test is designed to gauge one's visual thinking, creativity and comprehension skills. Experts suggest maintaining a portfolio of any work that would show an inclination for design. Through the course, students learn to work with different materials using various machines such as looms, dying machines, printing machines, metal and woodwork. Courses are designed to focus on green manufacture or sustainability. Students are trained to go through the process of converting an idea into a reality. A course in industrial design is not just about design though. In most colleges, students get to choose sub disciplines. For example, at Srishti School of Design, while the first year is all about building the foundation, in the 2nd and 3rd years, students can choose which studio they want to work in. "Each discipline offer studios and workshops such as photography, camera for films, public space design, electronics, etc. So a student is free to follow his interest and see how it pairs with industrial design," said Naga Nandini, course leader, Industrial Arts and Design Practices at Srishti School of Design. At IDC, besides tailor-made courses that can be pursued based on one's interest, the course is project oriented. "We try to find practical solutions to real-life issues and a lot depends on how well we understand the end user," said Chakravarthy. For one of their project, students at IDC designed signages for a hospital in the city as part of their project work. What is key to success in a design career is curiosity and the ability to think in a multi-directional view, say experts. The world is a freeway for industrial designers, say experts. From leading a design team as chief design officer to heading an R&amp;D team in any field or going the start-up way by becoming an entrepreneur, the options are numerous.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The health ministry may approach the Supreme Court with issues raised by states regarding implementation of the common medical entrance test this year. In a meeting with state health ministers on Monday, Union health minister JP Nadda discussed issues related to implementation of the court's order asking the Centre to conduct National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to any medical college in the country. While most states are in favour of NEET, some have raised logistics related concerns and sought more time to implement the order, Nadda said. "Most States are in favour of NEET in- principle. However, some States have expressed that there are some logistic issues that are impeding its implementation, and therefore they have desired for some more time," he said after meeting health ministers from about 18 states. States have pointed out that in some states the examination process was either underway or was soon to commence for induction to the state government medical colleges. Also, there were issues about the syllabus of the CBSE being different from what the state boards followed. Moreover, the states also pointed out that NEET should be allowed in regional languages in addition to Hindi and English in order to have parity for the students who have taken the state board exams. This comes in the wake of strong opposition from many members of Parliament during last week against the common entrance test to MBBS and dental colleges. There were also reports that an ordinance may be brought to bypass the Supreme Court ruling. Dismissing reports about ordinance, sources said after proper consultation the health ministry may approach the SC seeking more time to implement NEET for state medical colleges. In a statement, the ministry said concerns of the states shall be collated and soon a future course of action will be worked out. Nadda said the government was committed to bring about transparency in medical education and remove malpractices. The Supreme Court had ruled that starting this academic session, students would have to appear for NEET to seek admission to any medical or dental colleges in the country. Last week, it also turned down a bunch of appeals by states seeking to conduct their own medical admission tests and ruled that "only NEET would enable students to get admission to MBBS or BDS studies".</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Now that CBSE has announced it will declare Class XII board exam results on Saturday, May 21, many feel the board should "defer" it till Monday, May 23. The reason being that the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced is scheduled for Sunday. Students and their teachers fear the board results will impact their performance the next day. "It will definitely impact. That will be the only thing on the kids' minds. How can CBSE declare results a day before the JEE?" asks Keshav Agarwal of Turning Point. There are some posts on social media as well. One Twitter user writes, "Declaring Class 12 result a day before JEE advanced is not good idea. Please defer it for 23 May #CBSE." Over 1.98 lakh had qualified for JEE Advanced. To be fair, not all of them have registered for the exam and many will not be from CBSE board schools. Many JEE Advanced examines from the state or even ISC boards already have their results. However, not everyone thinks CBSE results arriving on Saturday will affect performance in the test on Sunday. RL Trikha from FITJEE points out that candidates know "absolute marks have no meaning for them." "What matters for them are percentiles. And by the time those come, JEE Advanced will be long over."</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The University Grants Commission on Thursday asked central universities to include modules of yoga teaching and training in their bachelor's and master's courses in physiotherapy. In a communication to vice-chancellors on Thursday, UGC secretary Jaspal S Sandhu referred to a a letter received from the Union HRD ministry seeking inclusion of yoga in Bachelors and Masters of Physiotherapy courses from the forthcoming academic session. Last week joint secretary in HRD ministry Ishita Roy had written to the UGC secretary in this regard and also informed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has desired that the possibility of giving preference to candidates with requisite knowledge of yoga, should be explored. The Modi government also wants universities to explore the possibility of a giving preference to candidates who have a certain level of expertise in yoga for admission to the bachelor's course in physiotherapy. Earlier, a government appointed committee on yoga education in universities, headed by HR Nagendra, who is also considered to be the Prime Minister's yoga guru, had recommended yoga syllabus for a 4-year bachelor's course and a 2-year masters course in physiotherapy. The committee had made several recommendations related to setting up of yoga departments in universities. Significantly, it had also recommended that expertise of Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Yogpeeth, S-VYASA Yoga University headed by Nagendra and some other institutes could be used for setting up of these departments.</text>

	<text>Eighth-grade girls are not only as skilled as boys at thinking through problems and using technology to solve them, they may even be a little better, a study released on Tuesday suggests. The findings come from a first-of-its-kind assessment of technology and engineering literacy by the Nation's Report Card. When asked to tackle real-life scenarios such as designing a safe bicycle lane or improving a pet iguana's habitat, 45 per cent of girls and 42 per cent of boys showed proficiency at understanding and using technology, the computer-based assessment found. "The importance here is to use this information to encourage more young women to recognize that they possess these skills, that they should have confidence with these skills," said Bill Bushaw, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board that oversees The Nation's Report Card. And, at a time when women are underrepresented in STEM- Science, Technology, Engineering and Math- jobs, it's important that they know "they can pursue careers not only in the STEM fields but in other fields that require problem solving and critical thinking," he said. The assessment was given to 21,500 eighth-grade students in 840 schools in 2014. It will be repeated in 2018. Among white students, 56 per cent scored proficient or better, compared with 18 per cent of black students and 28 per cent of Hispanic eighth-grade students. Suburban and rural students outperformed students in city schools, the report card said. About 25 per cent of students eligible for free or reduced school lunches scored proficient or above, compared to 59 per cent of students from families with higher incomes. When asked where they learned about building things or understanding how things worked, nearly two-thirds of the students said "family members". About 52 per cent reported taking at least one technology or engineering course in school. Whether they learned technology in or out of school, students with some exposure scored better on the assessment, the report said. "But access to these opportunities from place to place is patchy," said Dr. Tonya Matthews, president and chief executive of the Michigan Science Center, where the report was released. "That's a call for communities to create opportunities where needed, from schools to science centers to after-school programming." One of the test scenarios challenged students to consider speed limits and lane width to evaluate the safety of a bike route. The iguana task had them learning about iguanas and modifying the cage of a class pet named 'Iggy' to keep the creature from being cold, dehydrated or up all night. Bushaw said that the new, interactive nature of the test allowed students to better demonstrate their skills.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Unemployment has entered the health sciences sector. With supply outstripping demand and no work for new dental graduates, India has decided to stop all new dental colleges. The firm stand was taken recently at the general body meeting of the Dental Council of India which grants permission to new institutes. The decision follows requests from several existing colleges that wanted the council to reject fresh proposals for more institutes, as well as the high rate of unemployment among dentists. India currently has 309 dental colleges, which churn out around 26,000 dentists every year. The count was as high as 30,570 in 2010. In 1970, only 8,000 dental students graduated annually. "It would be a good idea to consolidate our numbers now and strengthen the existing institutes," said Dr Mansing Pawar, DCI member and dean of Government Dental College. An exception could be made for states like those in the north-east that do not have any dental college, he added. Some estimates suggest that India has 3 lakh dentists, but there is an imbalance in their spread. In 2004, India had one dentist per 10,000 people in urban areas and one dentist per 2.5 lakh people in the rural areas. It was not long ago that the good times were rolling for dentists. It is now, however, estimated that there will be a surplus of more than 1 lakh dentists in India by 2020. The DCI, on its part, has been trying to trim growth for some time now. In the last two years, it has only permitted new colleges with an attached medical institute to foray into the dental stream. But that was not enough. "Mushrooming of dental colleges in the past few years in India has led to unemployment among Indian dentists. Thousands of dentists are coming out every year with very low prospects of jobs," noted Namrata Dagli in her paper 'Increasing unemployment among Indian dental graduates'. Former acting DCI president Dr Mahesh Verma, who is the current director of the Maulana Azad Dental College, said the time has come to "not vitiate the problem and build on what we have". "Over the years, we have created a huge manpower of dentists and job avenues have shrunk. There is not much opportunity for today's passouts, except if they want to start their own practice, which too isn't easy. It needs money, space, infrastructure and the right attitude," he added. "Self-practice in urban areas is not very easy due to saturation of the dental market. In rural areas, private clinics are not viable because of low awareness of oral health among the rural population. Dental graduates are facing serious financial constraint. Unemployed dentists are left with no choice but to quit their profession and work in call centres or commit suicide," added Dagli, in her paper which appeared in the Journal of International Oral Health.</text>

	<text>The Indian women's hockey team will return to the Olympics after a long gap of 36 years having qualified for next year's Rio Games, courtesy England making it to the final of the EuroHockey Championships. The team spoke with Rohit E David on the challenges they'll face in Rio and their preparations for the Olympics. Now that the team has got a Rio berth, how will it prepare for the big event? Monika, Midfielder: We were adamant this year that we will qualify for the Olympics and we have achieved that. This achievement brings with it a bigger responsibility and we are aware that we have to stand up to it. The challenge ahead will not be easy as all top teams will be featuring in the Olympic Games and we know we have to take the level of our game higher and for this we are ready to work hard and be focused each day for the next whole year. Sunita Lakra, Defender: We have to be focused on the challenge ahead and not let the pressure to get the better of us. We have already started working on our strategies and we have to work on them basis the opponents during the Olympics. Lilima Minz, Midfielder: We have one year's time till the Olympics and we will work on our grey areas. We know we have a tough road ahead. I think we need to work on our defense for the Rio Olympics. We don't want our opposition to penetrate our circle freely. With the help of coaches like Mathias Ahrens, Helen Mary and CR. Kumar we are working thoroughly on our defense. Namita Toppo, Defender: We will analyse every minute of the game and build strategies accordingly so that we do not make mistakes during the tournament. Team coordination will also be our focus as that will be the key. We need to have enough confidence as a team and this will come with rigorous practice sessions. We will keep in mind the strengths of individuals and plan our game accordingly so that it helps us achieve our goal. Is there anything you feel the team needs before the Rio Games? Monika: While each one us is dedicated from here we will need to be more dedicated towards our goal. have to be open and ready to play from different positions. This will be helpful as incase there is a scenario that we have to step into someone else's shoes we know our role instantly. Vandana Katariya, Forward: The need of the hour is practice and practice every day. Even playing more tournaments will help us understand where do we lack and how best to work on the grey areas. Sushila Chandu, Defender: We need to work on our fitness and prepare mentally to absorb the pressure. We will work on concreting on our defence and creating goal scoring opportunities. European teams are physically dominant over the Asian contenders. With Mathias Ahrens, our chief coach, the team is concentrating on the overall fitness. We are trying to pace up our moves and stamina so that we can play the whole 60 minutes with the same speed. Ritu Rani, Midfielder: It's not every day that we get to play the Olympics and now that we have earned this opportunity we have to make it count. For me I will strive to better my play and make myself stronger which will help handle the pressure situations. We need to practice harder and work on our delivery as a unit. What we need is the support of the nation and their belief that we can make it happen. Do you feel that in India more importance is given to the men's team? Monika: That depends on how you take the situation. We have always associated hockey, football and cricket as a men's game and hence this feeling that they are giving more importance. While it is not so because had that been the scenario we would not have got so many opportunities to play and feature in international tournaments. Poonam Rani, Forward: I never felt any difference. Both the teams get equal importance among people. Those who love hockey, they come to see our matches too. Vandana: Yes the men's team has an edge because of their recent feats but I don't think they are given more importance. What are some of the differences you have noticed between men and women team that should be bridged? Monika: There is no difference between the teams. We are given equal opportunities like them. I think we could have a few more tournaments, which will help us better ourselves as we face this new challenge. Sushila: Both the teams are getting proper attention from Hockey India. We are getting the same facilities as the men's team. Right from coaching staff, support staff, accommodation during preparation camps all are same. Deep Grace Ekka, Defender: The men's team has superior defending skills and I feel that we should learn from them. While playing, they cover the whole ground which is very helpful to keep the ball possession and which we need to learn and inculcate. The men's team have got a hockey league, do you feel that women's hockey league is the need of the hour? Lilima: Yes. Players from all over the world participate in these leagues and which gives one a huge platform to play alongside the best players. Also leagues even give you young players who then make it to international arena. Rajani Etimarpu, Goalkeeper: I would be glad to have any good opportunity that comes to me as it will help me grow and a League of course would be a big platform. Savita, Goalkeeper: Definitely, various sports leagues in India have enhanced the game and people are moving beyond cricket. And with no doubts even the men's team has benefited from the Hockey India League which has not only allowed the players to play on an international platform but also have helped them to learn the International game style. The women's team will also love to play in such a league which will help us to develop our skills in a much healthier way. Sunita: Yes it is. A league anywhere allows the players to have a bigger environment to learn from. Whom would you prefer - an Indian or foreign coach and why? Monika: We practice under both. We have Mathias Ahrens as Chief Coach, Roelant Oltmans as High Performance Director, CR Kumar as the Coach, so you can see that there is no dearth of experience from where we can learn and grow. I think very few teams would have this kind of back end support and we are lucky. Vandana: It is the coach that matters and the value that he or she adds. So discriminating between a foreign and an Indian coach will not be right. Sushila: It hardly matters. Nationality has nothing to do with the coach. It's all about how our team grasps what the coach is teaching and how the team is responding to the style of play that the coach expects from us. Namita: Both Indian and foreign coaches have their own set of lessons to teach. Both are an asset for us with their experiences and uniqueness which comes to us as a gift from them. While the foreign coaches have new techniques which can be tried to improve our game, the Indian coaches understand our mind and comfort level and how these techniques can be implemented keeping the same in mind. Rajani: Both Indian as well as foreign coaches have their own style of training us and presently we are learning different aspects from both which has helped us improve our game. Savita: I personally prefer Indian coaches as he would have a better understanding of the Indian game style. But learning from Roelant Oltmans, Mathias Ahrens and in the past Neil Hawgood have helped us learn better techniques hence their presence has been a boon for us. How did you start playing hockey? Lilima: I started playing hockey in my hostel in Odisha. After successfully getting selected in trials, I realised I had a bright future in hockey and that's what acted as a driving force to my dreams. Managing studies and sport at the same time was a problem for me. Namita: That was a sudden decision. Everyone in my family insisted me to play hockey and when I got selected in the trials, since then there was no looking back. Rani Rampal, Forward: I started my hockey career from Shahbad. As it is very famous for hockey, I had developed a liking for the sport from that place itself. Many players have evolved from Shahbad and I always wanted to experience that fame and feeling of pride and so chose hockey. Monika: My initial interest in hockey was developed by my friends. They often used to talk about this game and this developed a curiosity in me to know more about the game. What were some of the challenges you faced as a hockey player? Monika: My only concern was the financial factor. Being a sport whose equipments are expensive, it was difficult for me to get the best equipment for undergoing training. Also health supplements were expensive so monetary problem was the main concern for me when I started to play. Vandana: My parents at a point of time didn't support me to play hockey and asked me to stop playing. It was my dedication towards the game that dug the courage inside me and motivated me to play hockey. Rani: The biggest challenge I faced while playing hockey is being a girl. A female is not given that preference and this is what created a hurdle in my decision to choose hockey as a profession. Also, making my family believe that hockey is the career I am looking forward to was most challenging. Even financial constraint was a challenge to a girl like me who is not that financially strong. Whom do you look up to as a hockey player? Monika: My inspirations are the senior players who took our nation to the Rio Olympics. They are my idols and I learn a lot from them. Vandana: My coach in Haridwar and Lucknow were my prime inspiration during my early years. There support and hard work has paid today that we are playing for our country. Sunita: My inspiration is the captain of the India national men's team- Sardar Singh. Savita: I'm really motivated by PR Sreejesh (goalkeeper, men's hockey team). He has helped me to understand the art of goal keeping in a better way. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>The surging Los Angeles Clippers shrugged off the absence of forward Blake Griffin and center DeAndre Jordan by easing to a 104-90 victory over the Miami Heat at Staples Center on Wednesday. Backup center Cole Aldrich, who started in place of Jordan, scored 19 points and grabbed seven rebounds, while point guard Chris Paul had 15 points, 12 assists and six rebounds, sparking the Clippers to their 10th consecutive victory. Forward Paul Pierce and guard Jamal Crawford scored 15 points apiece for Los Angeles (26-13) with the former also collecting nine rebounds. Griffin missed his ninth contest with a partially torn left quad tendon but Jordan's absence was a surprise before the game when it was revealed he had pneumonia. His withdrawal ended Jordan's NBA-leading consecutive games streak at 360. Guard Gerald Green scored 19 points to lead the Heat, who lost their third in a row. Dwyane Wade finished with 16 points and eight rebounds, while forward Chris Bosh had 11 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for Miami (22-17). Heat guard Goran Dragic missed the contest with a calf injury. Initially, Miami did not seem to miss a beat without Dragic, leading by as much as 16 in the first half before Los Angeles cut the deficit to single digits. A 9-3 run to close the half allowed the Clippers to pull within 52-45 at the break. Los Angeles rallied despite shooting only 39.2 percent to 52.5 percent for the Heat. However, 11 turnovers by the Heat to only three for the Clippers in the first half did not help their cause. Overall, the Clippers shot 42.6 percent to 44.3 percent for Miami. Los Angeles drained 11-of-25 (44 percent) from three-point range to 9-of-24 (37.5 percent) for the Heat. In the third quarter, the Clippers opened with a 24-5 spurt, which included a 13-0 run, for a 69-57 advantage after an Aldrich hook shot with 6:11 left. Los Angeles led 79-69 heading into the final period after they out-scored the Heat 34-17 in the third. A 10-2 run to kick off the fourth quarter blew the game open for the Clippers.</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: The captains of India, Sri Lanka, Ireland and Bangladesh women's cricket teams flashed their best smiles as they posed with the ICC World T20 Trophy. Then came the introductions. When the stylish Bangladesh skipper was introduced by the moderator as "Ayasha Rahman", there were no raised eyebrows. But the young Bangladeshi, with heavily-kohled eyes, spoke up."I'm not Ayasha Rahman," she said, her eyes darkening, "My name is Jahanara Alam." That's something that slipped between bat and pad, but that's women's cricket. Few know the players, fewer still watch them play. They may not play to the gallery , but they play because they are passionate. It is this passion that will be on display when the 10 women's teams play in the World T20, starting with a warm-up game between India and Ireland on Thursday. Three-time champions and holders Australia may have lost back-to-back home series against India and New Zealand, yet they are tipped to take back the trophy . Having said that, the aura of invincibility around the Australia team has faded. Add to that the exposure to competitive T20 that players from West Indies, New Zealand, England and South Africa have got in the Women's Big Bash League, and the Australians will have a task on hand. But India skipper Mithali Raj, who led the team to a series win against Australia in January this year, still believes the team from Down Under will be tough to beat. "Last edition's champions Australia will be tough contenders. Though we have beaten them in Australian conditions, the World Cup is a different scenario," she said. Sri Lanka's Sashikala Siriwardene agreed on Meg Lanning's team being the hot favourites but Ireland captain Isobel Joyce put her money on New Zealand, led by the formidable Suzie Bates. Jahanara, on the other hand, believes the hosts are serious title contenders. "I support India. For my team no team is tough. If we believe we can do, we can do. But I will pick India."</text>

	<text>RANCHI: People say absence makes the heart grow fonder. On the eve of the second qualifier here on Friday, it was found that not only the love for IPL was greater this year among the fans, getting the chance to watch a qualifier has injected more enthusiasm. Missing out on league matches has turned to be boon. Not only the fans, CSK management is also happy to get IPL engagements back to their captain's hometown. Asked if the familiar surrounding at captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's backyard will hold any advantage, CSK coach Stephen Felming said, "I hope so. We played a lot last year here obviously and it was key part of that season and some emotional connection because of skipper's home town. So we are hoping it will be good for us. "But we know it's not all. When it comes down to competitive matches, I guess it's just the improvement from the side to make sure we do the job, it doesn't matter what surroundings you are in. If you don't play well enough you won't get the goodies. So we got to play well." Interestingly the fact that tickets are sold out may not guarantee a fullhouse. Some had booked the tickets hoping they will get to see Mumbai Indians and thus, former stars Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Jonty Rhodes, who have retired as players, here. "Watching Dhoni vs Virat will be a treat for us. Dhoni didn't play in last match (India vs Sri Lanka ODI in November) here. We will get to see him tomorrow. But I wanted to see Mumbai here because of Sachin, Jonty and Ponting. They don't play now, so this was the chance to see these greats of the game here. Unfortunately we missed the chance. Many of my friends and acquaintances had booked tickets anticipating Mumbai Indians would play here," Pratap Kumar from Chutia said. However, Mumbai or no Mumbai, a cracker of a match awaits Ranchi in the sweltering heat with a promise to send the mercury higher.</text>

	<text>The celebrations said it all. When Vijay CC defended their TNCA elite first division title against Jolly Rovers for the second successive year at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here last month, the players were understandably ecstatic. The match provided a ringside view of the competitive nature with which the league has been contested for years. "It was a highclass match which went down to the wire. Both teams were in it till the very last minute and I believe that's what the league encounters are all about," pointed out R Prasanna, skipper of Vijay CC. Each game has seen its share of top performers - both from the state and outside. The presence of non-Tamil Nadu cricketers in numerous teams has played its part in raising the overall standard of the league. "Someone like Piyush Chawla, who has played for India, knows what it takes to excel in the game. He plays mentor to our bowlers and that has obviously benefited the local players in the team. Players from outside have a huge role to play," says Jolly Rovers skipper Hemant Kumar. The bigger question is - what brings these players to Chennai? For any nonstate cricketer, playing in the TNCA league provides a competitive environment where they test their cricketing skills and also enjoy a host of other benefits. "There is a strong corporate backing for the clubs who feature in this league. The likes of Sanmar Group, India Cements, MRF and numerous corporates support teams, which is a huge advantage. These firms ensure job opportunities which can be a big boost for cricketers who can then concentrate on performing on the field," says Chawla, who is on the payrolls of Chemplast. Rajasthan's Robin Bist, a regular face in Jolly Rovers, feels the high-class infrastructure too has its role to play in the league in attracting talent from outside. "Jolly Rovers has its own ground to train and that's the case with most of the teams which play in the first division league. Not many leagues across India can boast of such high-class infrastructure," he says. Haryana's Jayant Yadav, who turned up for Jolly Rovers, felt the TNCA league acted as an ideal preparation ground ahead of the domestic season. "It is vital to have practice matches when you are beginning the season. Since most parts of the country witness rains in the months of July and August, playing at the TNCA division league is an advantage since the weather is clear here. That's not all. Most clubs have state cricketers regularly featuring in their ranks, and bowling to them, this automatically notches up the level of the game," points out Yadav. Bharath Reddy, who has been part of Jolly Rovers for long, feels the non-state cricketers have brought a new dimension to the league circuit. "It helps them to understand what the league is all about. For the local lads - it is a classic case of seeing where they stand when they either bowl or face these players who come from outside," says the former Indian cricketer. They may arrive here not being fully versed with the conditions, but non-state players have over the years gone on to make a mark on the ground here.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Carlos Brathwaite's assault on Ben Stokes on Sunday not only overwhelmed West Indian fans, it also had a few people in the Delhi Daredevils team management purring in delight as their Rs 4.2 crore pick for this year's IPL stole the limelight at the Eden. Brathwaite, an allrounder, also excelled with the ball in the final, returning figures of 32/3. However, it was his batting that had prompted the Daredevils management to shell out a fortune for the player. The team think-tank was swayed after watching his hitting skills on Youtube. It is ironical that the 27-year old shot to fame on Sunday with his batting, something that has became his second skill as he moved up the ranks in domestic cricket. He has 88 first-class wickets at an average of 22.93 in 38 matches while he has scored 1471 runs at an average of 27.24 with just one century. Brathwaite started off as a batsman in junior cricket but made it to the West Indies team last November riding on his skills with the ball primarily. Daredevils CEO Hemant Dua hopes Brathwaite's overnight stardom will help the fans connect more with a team which has been languishing at the bottom of the table over the past two seasons. Be it David Warner, Glenn Maxwell or Andre Russell, Daredevils have a history of unearthing talent from other countries and giving them a platform. But often, the franchise has also let go of the services of these very stars after just a season or two. "I don't want to comment on the past. But we hope we build a strong base for the future this time," Dua told TOI on Monday. Brathwaite's new-found stardom and the price paid for him will have the team management under pressure to play him in every match in IPL. "Every player will play on merit. The price tag means nothing here. It was his (Brathwaite) day and he performed in the World T20 final. In T20, as West Indies have shown, every other player has to come to the party in every match," Dua reckoned. CRICKETER EYES ANOTHER EDEN BASH Meanwhile, Brathwaite will be back at the Eden Gardens next Sunday when Daredevils open their IPL-9 campaign against Kolkata Knight Riders next Sunday. A classmate of pop star Rihanna, the Barbados player celebrated the WT20 title with his girlfriend. West Indies skipper Darren Sammy was all praise for Brathwaite's for effort that sealed West Indies' second WT20 trophy. "There was a reason why he was bought in the IPL. You saw what he is capable of doing. He is one to watch out for."</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Banned from all cricket-related activities in India by a Supreme Court committee headed by former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha, Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra had his heart in his mouth in 2013 when Delhi Police started probing him, but he ultimately left the Capital smiling. The special cell of Delhi Police, which unearthed the 'spot-fixing' racket and stumbled upon franchise owners/officials indulging in betting, questioned Kundra, got confirmation of his betting from his business partner Umesh Goenka but didn't book him. For the special cell, it was tricky to book Kundra under the Gambling Act as there was no "solid evidence", then commissioner of police Neeraj Kumar, who spearheaded the IPL cleaning campaign, had said. Kumar went on to say that Kundra "had confessed to placing bets on his team" and that "he had lost a lot of money on bets". Delhi Police had claimed that Kundra placed bets through Umesh Goenka. During his questioning, Kundra reportedly told the police that "being a British national, he was unaware of the fact that betting was illegal in India". Delhi Police didn't want to get involved in 'betting' cases as their Mumbai counterparts were probing these at the time with the arrest of Vindu Dara Singh and Gurunath Meiyappan. Instead, the Delhi anti-terror sleuths shot off a letter to Rajasthan Police about possible involvement of Kundra in betting, leaving the ball in their court. Neeraj Kumar, who is now part of BCCI's anti-corruption unit, had said, "We don't have evidence against Raj Kundra, so can't arrest him." In fact, the special cell had found while examining Goenka that even Kundra's wife Shilpa Shetty had placed a bet of Rs 1 lakh during one of the matches in IPL 6. These allegations were never brought by Delhi Police on record. Sources said Delhi Police's investigation report and statements were used by the Justice R M Lodha committee while giving its verdict on Tuesday. Reacting on his suspension, Kundra said on Wednesday that he was "wronged", while terming it as "unfair" that the whole team was "harshly treated" for the actions of one individual. "Today is a very depressing and sad day for me as my integrity has been questioned and my support in this investigation seems to have backfired. While I have great respect for the Supreme Court and the judicial system, unfortunately, in this case, I cannot but feel that I have been wronged," Kundra said in a statement.</text>

	<text>LONDON: West Indies' swashbuckling batsman Chris Gayle has sparked yet another sexism row after making lewd comments to a female sports journalist during an interview. The West Indies star earlier was fined $10,000 by Australia Twenty20 Big Bash team Melbourne Renegades in January after an infamous "Don't blush, baby" live TV interview with Channel Ten reporter Mel McLaughlin after asking her out for a drink. The 36-year-old spoke to Charlotte Edwardes in an article published by the Times magazine. He is currently playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League . At one point in the interview Gayle - who recently celebrated the arrival of a baby girl called Blush with his partner Tash - told Edwardes that he has "a very, very big bat, the biggest in the wooooorld". He then added, "You think you could lift it? You'd need two hand," reports The Daily Mail. According to the article, Gayle asked Edwardes how many black men she has "had" and wants to know if she has ever had a threesome. "I bet you have. Tell me," he is reported to have said. Edwardes also alleged the Jamaican made comments about whether she dyes her hair, while lowering his eyes downwards suggestively. Gayle also answered questions on sex, female equality and homophobia during the interaction. " Women should please their man. When he comes home, food is on the table. Serious. You ask your husband what he likes and then you make it," he said. But he also claimed, "Women should have equality and they do have equality. They have more than equality. Women can do what they want. Jamaican women are very vocal. They will let you know what time is it, for sure." Edwardes also broached the topic of homophobia with the West Indies star, who responded by stating that people should be able to be who they want to be. "The culture I grew up in, gays were negative. But people can do whatever they want. You can't tell someone how to live their life. It's a free world," he was reported as saying. Back in January, Renegades CEO Stuart Coventry labelled the on-air incident with McLaughlin as "completely inappropriate and disrespectful".</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Rahul Dravid could be seen wearing a coach or a mentor's cap in the upcoming IPL season. The legendary batsman, who was associated with the suspended Rajasthan Royals franchise till last year, is in talks with Delhi Daredevils who have let go the services of Gary Kirsten this year. It is learnt that Dravid is not averse to the idea of joining an IPL franchise after having finished a long season with the India `A' and India Under-19 teams. According to sources, talks between Dravid and Daredevils have reached an advanced stage. "Dravid is keen to take up the role of a mentor but he is reluctant to be full-time coach. He has had a long season starting with the India 'A' team in June and he just got free after the ICC U-19 World Cup last week. He wants to spend more time with his family as well," a source close to the development told TOI adding that the only point of contention from Dravid's end is the amount of time he will be able to give to the franchise. While Daredevils management didn't want to commit on his name, it did concede that Dravid was an option. A decision is likely to be taken in a fortnight. "Things are in a speculative stage. We have a few other names going around as well. Dravid is definitely one of them. At this point, it's difficult to commit as the owners of the team are not in the country. Once they return, a final call will be taken," a senior Daredevils official told TOI. There is a theory going around that Dravid and the core of former Rajasthan Royals management helped Daredevils put together a revamped team this year. The team has a fair sprinkling of Rajasthan like Karun Nair and Sanju Samson who have been bought for high prices along with South African Chris Morris. There are three players in Rishabh Pant, Khaleel Ahmed and Mahipal Lomror from the India U-19 team which played in the World Cup in Bangladesh. Khaleel was apparently hand-picked by Zaheer Khan who doubles up as player and bowling coach at Daredevils. "Zaheer has identified Khaleel as one with potential and he can be worked on during his stay with the franchise. Pant was being followed for six months since he played the U-19 challenger tour nament," the DD official revealed. Under Dravid's captaincy, Royals made it to the last four of IPL twice. He also led the team to the final of the Champions League T20 in 2013.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Jerome Valcke denies "fabricated and outrageous" allegations that led to his suspension as FIFA secretary general, his US-based lawyer said in a statement on Thursday. "Jerome Valcke unequivocally denies the fabricated and outrageous accusations by Benny Alon of alleged wrongdoing in connection with the sale of World Cup tickets," a statement from New York attorney Barry Berke said. Valcke, 54, had been accused of taking kickbacks by Alon over a deal with FIFA to sell tickets for the 2014 World Cup. However his laywer's statement said Valcke "never received or agreed to accept any money or anything else of value from Alon." "As has been reported, FIFA entered into an agreement with Alon's company, JB Sports Marketing," the statement said. "That agreement and FIFA's subsequent business dealings with Alon were vetted and approved by FIFA and its legal counsel."</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Two years ago, the Delhi Police special cell was listening into a few calls being made from Pakistan to Dubai. They had little idea that they were on the verge of unearthing one of the biggest rackets in Indian cricket. On March 26, 2013, one of the callers (923333206****) mentioned words like "league", "over" and "rates". The cops, especially the then commissioner of police Neeraj Kumar, got suspicious as the underworld men were discussing cricket in such detail and decided to dig further. It turned out that as many as three players of Rajasthan Royals were involved in something called "spot fixing", the new way to fix matches in intervals. The mammoth operation involving the police agencies of Mumbai and Rajasthan as also the Enforcement Directorate led to the arrest of over 50 people in different states, including players, their agents/managers and bookies. READ ALSO: Rs 200 fine, one month prison for Meiyappan? The Delhi Police had put some numbers on surveillance in a different case when they stumbled upon the conversation in question. Around 9.32pm on the aforementioned date, a Pakistan-based caller spoke to someone in Dubai for 108 seconds. Delhi Police, with the help of intelligence agencies and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), got the caller's voice examined through layered voice analysis tests and found it to be that of none other than Dawood Ibrahim. Dawood was using code words in the calls with his aide, later identified as Javed Chautani. Later, a Delhi bookie, Ramesh Vyas, also got a call from the same number. READ ALSO: Raj Kundra almost got off the hook Delhi Police then began intercepting the calls of some other bookies, including Ashwini Aggarwal alias Tinku Mandi and Ramesh Vyas, and eventually unearthed the tweaked and latest version of match fixing  spot fixing. This method involves fixing parts of the match  say, players being asked to give away a pre-determined number of runs in a given over  to affect the verdict. The first instance of spot fixing was established on May 5 in a Pune Warriors versus Rajasthan Royals match. On May 9, inspector Badrish Dutt of the special cell registered an FIR in this connection. A day later, Dutt was found dead along with his girlfriend in his Gurgaon flat in what is believed to be a murder-suicide.

Six days later, pacer S Sreesanth and two other Rajasthan Royals, bowlers Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan, were arrested from Mumbai in a clandestine operation by a Delhi special cell team. Even though the Delhi Police came across some more big names from the cricketing world while examining accused persons, and senior officers muttered names in off-the-record briefings, they were never probed for lack of solid evidence. READ ALSO: Judges topple Kings, Royals The operation shocked the entire nation and the special cell went on to arrest more than 30 people. Several controversies have erupted since then, but the case it seems, reached its logical end on Tuesday when former CJI R M Lodha banned Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years for their alleged misconduct.

	<text>Regardless of the fact that India is out of the World Cup, India's World T20 campaign has been a Virat Kohli show. Even as India lost the semi-final to the West Indies, Virat's performances earned him laurels from pundits and fans alike. While Virat fever gripped India, one neighbourhood in West Delhi has a more personal interest in the Indian vice-captain's performance. Meera Bagh, where Virat grew up and learnt to play cricket the way he does, turns into 'Virat Vihar' every time India plays. 'Woh ab India ka Virat hai' As we take an auto from the Janakpuri East Metro station to Meera Bagh on the evening of the semi-final, we ask the autowallah if he knows that Virat Kohli used to stay here once. He replies, "Humein nahi pata tha ki woh yahin rehte thay. Lekin bahut achha laga sunke ki woh yahaan ke rehne waale hain. Virender Sehwag bhi toh yahin paas ke Na jafgarh ilake ke hain. Virat ke liye toh kya hi bolein. Ab woh sirf Meera Bagh ke Vi rat thodi na hain, poore desh ke Virat hain." Crowd outside the Kohli house at 'Virat Vihar' The Kohlis used to live at A-43, Meera Bagh, before moving to Gurgaon last July. Even though the family doesn't live there anymore, the house still bears the Kohli nameplate and neighbours say that Virat's brother and mother visit the house every now and then. The house, something of a landmark in the locality, still manages to draw a few curious 'tourists', particularly on days when India is playing. Most people in Meera Bagh have a Virat anecdote to share. A guard at the A-block en trance tells us, "Pehle toh bahut log aate thay poochne ki Virat Kohli ka ghar kaunsa hai. Ab unke jaane ke baad thoda kam hua hai, par phir bhi match ke time ek-do log aaj bhi aa jaate hain." A crowd of 10-12 youngsters had gathered outside A-43 as India's innings gathered pace on the day of the semifinal and Virat started to hit those boundaries. Pankaj, the guard at Virat's building, says that the crowd used to be much bigger when the family stayed there. "Ab toh ginti ke hi log hain. Pehle toh itne aate thay ki dhakka maar ke hatana padta tha. Har match ke time yahan 50-100 logon ki bheed jama ho jaati thi," he says. Listening to the match score on a pocket radio, he adds, "Yeh colony toh famous hi Virat Kohli ki wajah se hai, sab 'Virat Vihar' bolte hain." Residents recall that after the 2011 World Cup victory, there was a sea of people outside the house to congratulate the family. Kuldeep Malik, a resident, says, "When India won the 2011 World Cup, there was a loudspeaker blaring from Virat's house about the win and there was a huge crowd outside his residence. The RWA had put up a big screen in the park also." 'Haar-jeet nahi, humko Virat ki batting se matlab hai' As India ended its innings, there were fireworks all around Meera Bagh. For the residents, it was more of a celebration of Virat's innings than India's score. "Humko haarjeet se matlab nahi. Apna Kohli achha khela hai, wahi kaafi hai," a boy standing outside Virat's residence says. Rahul Sharma, a driver standing nearby, adds, "Woh WhatsApp forward toh dekha hi hai na? Poore team ko Baahubali ki tarah utha rakha hai Virat ne. Hum ko uski batting se matlab hai bas." AK Bedi, a neighbour, says, "When the family was here, there was a buzz when he used to return after playing some series. Even Anushka (Sharma) visited the house a few times, the next door neighbours tell us." Sunita Bedi, his wife, adds, "Inna sona khela Virat ne. Aur log bhi utna achha khel lete toh jeet jaate." Even though India lost the match, for the residents of Meera Bagh, Virat was still the star. Sahiba Juneja, a university student who stays on the second floor of A-43, says, "I met him three years back.We hadn't moved here yet, but I had come to see our house. When my friends got to know that I stay in the same build ing as Virat, they were like, 'Please milwa do. Please get us his autograph.' Now all the hoopla has reduced and the autograph re quests have also stopped ever since the family moved to Gurgaon."</text>

	<text>Kevin Durant turned the conversation back to the court and away from his impending free agency with a final-second jump shot that lifted the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 117-114 victory over Orlando Magic on Wednesday. With daily reports focusing on Durant's possible departure from Oklahoma City following this season, the All-Star forward provided a timely reminder that his loyalty at this moment remains with the Thunder. Oklahoma City and Orlando were locked at 114-114 when Durant pulled off a nifty cross-over dribble and fired a three-pointer that found the bottom of the basket with less than a second remaining. Prior to fending off Magic defenders, Durant had spent much of his time shaking off questions about potential new suitors. "It's out of my control. Guys are going to write stories about what they want to write about (and where I could go)," Durant told reporters prior to scoring 37 points in Wednesday's game. "(The free agency talk) is ramped up a bit. I just try to stay locked in to where I am." Durant, 27, has spent his entire career with the Thunder franchise dating back to their days in Seattle before they moved to Oklahoma City in 2008. But after failing to win an NBA title alongside running mate Russell Westbrook, speculation has mounted that Durant could ply his trade elsewhere and there are no shortage of rumoured suitors for the four-time league scoring champion. He has been linked to the Washington Wizards, Los Angeles Lakers, and most recently, the defending champion Golden State Warriors, in various stories swirling around him. "It's just a part of this (free agency) process," Durant said. "When the time comes we'll talk about it. Right now I'm 100 percent locked in to helping (the Thunder) be the best we can be."</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: The city is ready for the razzmatazz but will the gods play along? The question haunted organizers, Bollywood stars, fans and cricketers on the eve of the grand IPL-8 inaugural ceremony at Salt Lake Stadium. With Nor'westers lashing the city for the second day running, everyone is keeping their fingers crossed for a rain-free spell on Tuesday evening. That though would be nothing short of a miracle. The Met office has predicted another thunderstorm on Tuesday evening, prompting fears of a washout. Tickets for the high-decibel evening  starring among others Hrithik Roshan, Anushka Sharma, Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Frahan Akhtar  sold out within hours of counters opening . READ ALSO: Hrithik, Shahid to perform in IPL 8 opening ceremony "Tuesday will see the formation of another cluster of thunderclouds. Therefore, there is every chance of rain," said Devendra Pradhan, deputy director general Indian Meteorological Department. If the rain arrives towards afternoon or early evening, organizers of the glitzy jamboree could still hope to salvage the show. But a late-evening thunderstorm may just kill the programme that includes floor projections, lazer shows and explosive dance routines. According to the Met, the cyclonic circulation over Gangetic West Bengal currently extends up to a kilometer above sea level and is bringing in copious quantities of moisture, triggering cloud formation. Strong winds are turning these into thundershowers, the intensity of the downpour depending on the height of the cloud and volume of moisture within. Such a thundershower struck the city on Monday evening accompanied by hail in some areas. A cluster of tall cumulonimbus clouds extending up to 18 km had resulted in heavy rain in Kolkata on Sunday. The height of the cloud was lower at 13 km on Monday. Though this cloud cluster will dissipate on Monday night, the cyclonic circulation will remain active and hence moisture incursion is expected to continue. As a result, rain clouds will again gather on Tuesday with the possibility of another thundershower towards afternoon or early evening. The only hope is that the intensity and duration of the rain could be less than what the city experienced on Sunday. "I am keeping my fingers crossed for fair weather on both Tuesday and Wednesday. Not just the inaugural event, I also hope to catch the opener between KKR and Mumbai Indians. I do hope rain does not play spoilsport," said Aryan Bagaria of Bangur Avenue. Rain apart, there are traffic concerns, too, for fans travelling to Salt Lake Stadium. A rally by Left Front on Tuesday afternoon is likely to choke traffic in the city centre. The rally from Mahajati Sadan to Esplanade will start at 3.30 pm and will have participants walking from vantage points like Sealdah and Howrah, creating massive congestion.</text>

	<text>KARACHI: Facing criticism for Pakistan's dismal show in the ICC World Twenty20, Shahid Afridi today stepped down as captain of the team but will continue to play in the shortest format of the game. The Afridi-led Pakistan failed to make it to the semifinals of the World Twenty20 in India, where his comments also drew the ire of former players. The 36-year-old all-rounder and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had hinted that World T20 could well be be his last as skipper. "Today, I wish to inform my fans in Pakistan and all over the world that I am relinquishing the captaincy of the T20 Pakistani team of my own volition," Afridi said in a statement, released on his twitter account. "On this day, I thank Allah (SWT) for His Kindness and Mercy which enabled me to discharge my leadership duties, to the best of my abilities for the sake of honour and prestige of my motherland. For me it was a great honour to lead my country in all three formats of the game," Afridi wrote in his statement. Afridi, however, asserted that he will be available for selection as a player in the team even though PCB Chairman Shaharyar Khan has made it clear that the all-rounder is no longer a surety in the side. "My profound thanks to the PCB and its Chairman Shaharyar Khan who gave me the honour to lead the national team. I would also like to inform that InshaAllah I intend to continue to play the game for my country and league cricket etc. and request my fans for kindly keep praying and supporting for my best future performances for Pakistan (as a player); and in all other arenas of the game, world over." The mercurial cricketer played 27 Tests for Pakistan before retiring from the format in 2010 with 1716 runs and 48 wickets. In 398 ODIs, he has 8064 runs and 395 wickets, while 98 T20 International appearances have fetched him 1405 runs and 97 wickets. Afridi found himself mired in controversies during Pakistan's World T20 campaign. First, he drew flak in Pakistan for stating that he and his players were loved more in India than back home. Later, Pakistan lost three of their four group stage games, including a high-voltage clash against arch-foes India, to bow out of the tournament. Amid the dismal on-field run, Afridi stirred up another controversy by specifically thanking Kashmiris for cheering his team in Mohali. The remark was criticised by the BCCI with Board Secretary Anurag Thakur saying that the cricketer should avoid making political statements. Post the World T20 debacle, Afridi had sought forgiveness from the people of his country for failing to live upto their expectations. "I don't care what other people say about me but I am answerable to you (people of Pakistan). I, Shahid Afridi, seeks forgiveness from the people of Pakistan for not living upto the expectations that you had from this team and me," Afridi had said in a brief video message on his Twitter page.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK/ZURICH: Major soccer sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for the immediate resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the most significant move by companies supporting the sport since a bribery and corruption scandal erupted at world football's governing body last May. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) , McDonald's (MCD.N), Visa (V.N), and Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), companies that have long linked their brand names to soccer, on Friday demanded Blatter step down immediately in a strong push for change at the organization. Blatter earlier announced he would resign in February next year. The sponsor statements, all using similar language, came just a week after Swiss authorities said they were opening a criminal investigation into Blatter, the 79-year-old Swiss national who has lead FIFA for the past 17 years. AB InBev said it has been "actively engaged" in the FIFA reform process as part of a group of sponsors. "Every day that passes, the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish," Coca Cola said. "FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach." Visa and McDonald's joined the call for Blatter to step aside. "The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership," McDonald's said in an emailed statement. Blatter responded by saying he would not resign, setting the stage for a battle over who should take the helm in the next few months before February when elections are set for a new FIFA president. In a statement from his U.S. lawyer Richard Cullen, Blatter said he believed leaving office would not be in FIFA's best interest or advance the needed reforms of the organization. Scandals surrounding global soccer exploded in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on U.S. charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery schemes that dated back decades. Last Friday, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General said it opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. It was the first time that authorities investigating corruption in the world's most popular sport had pointed the finger directly at Blatter. He has denied wrongdoing and his U.S. attorney said he was cooperating with the Swiss probe. FIFA's awarding of the 2018 and 2022 competitions to Russia and Qatar is one of the strands under scrutiny from U.S. and Swiss authorities investigating corruption in the organization, a worry for tournament sponsors including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Visa. "One of the things consumers are looking for in brands today is for them to be responsible," said Trevor Wade from the brand consultancy firm Landor. She said the moves by the sponsors was a way to take a public stand about something they think matters to customers. It is an unprecedented decision by companies that have largely stood back as developments in the case unfolded in recent months, said Jaimie Fuller a co-founder of campaign group #NewFifaNow. "The drastic nature of this call stresses the extreme problems faced by FIFA," Fuller said, "and should show everybody how the sports governing body is teetering on the abyss."</text>

	<text>LOS ANGELES: Former tennis world No.1 Maria Sharapova said on Monday that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she has been taking the last 10 years for health issues. The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, tested positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1. "I received a letter from the ITF (International Tennis Federation) saying that I had failed a drug test at the Australian Open ... and I take full responsibility for it," Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel. "For the past 10 years, I have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor ... and it also has another name of meldonium, which I did not know. "It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance." Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. The stunning news came a day after Sharapova's management team said she was going to make a "major announcement," which had many speculating that she was going to announce her retirement from professional tennis. "I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down. I have been playing since the age of four a sport that I love so deeply," said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. "I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game." Sharapova, who has struggled with a series of injuries in recent years, has not competed since she lost to Serena Williams in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January. "I was first given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues I was having back in 2006," said Sharapova, who according to Forbes earned $29.5 million in 2015. "I was getting sick a lot. I was getting the flu every couple of months. I had irregular EKG results. "I had a deficiency in magnesium and a family history of diabetes, and there were signs of diabetes. That is one of the medications, along with others, that I received." Read this story in Telugu</text>

	<text>India men's hockey team lost to New Zealand 0-2 in the opening Test match of the four-match at Nelson on Tuesday. New Zealand, who dominated the first two halves, took the lead early in the sixth minute via a penalty corner conversion by Nick Haig. In the second half, the hosts double the lead when Jared Panchia found the net late in the second half. India Gurjinder Singh failed to convert the lone penalty corner earned by India. The visitors came back strongly in the third and the fourth quarter but failed to find the net. Both teams will now lock horns for the second time in the series on Wednesday.</text>

	<text>KUNSHAN (China): Olympic champion Li Xuerui led the Chinese national squad to victory over South Korea at the Uber Cup final in China Saturday, securing the country's 14th world badminton team championship title in dominant fashion. China rarely surrendered command over the court during its 3-1 triumph in front of a packed home crowd in the eastern city of Kunshan, near Shanghai. Li, the world number three, brushed off an early deficit after dropping the first game to seventh-ranked Sung Ji-hyun. The Olympic gold medallist rallied back for the win by controlling the pace and keeping the South Korean out of sync with repeated drop shots in the 14-21, 21-13, 21-10 victory. "Every step in the team match is one step for myself," Li told a news conference after the match, adding she planned to celebrate "quietly" after the week-long tournament. Sixth-ranked doubles team Jung Kyung-eun and Shin Seung-chan from South Korea prevented a whitewash, powering through a 16-21, 21-17, 25-23 scrap against the world number four China duo of Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei that clocked in at 94 minutes. Wang Shixian put China back in the win column as she exhausted Kim Hyo-min, moving the shuttlecock across the court at will during the 21-13, 21-12 rout. Following the win, Wang downplayed her individual efforts and Olympic ambitions as Rio approaches, saying she was proud to be "fighting for our team, for our national team". Chen Qingchen and Tang Yuanting delivered the third and final victory in the best of five series by beating Chang Ye-na and Lee So-hee in straight sets, 21-14, 21-16. With the championship sealed, the fans in attendance unleashed a deafening approval of the pair's spirited performance as their teammates rushed onto the court to celebrate. The South Koreans, who were aiming to end their six-year drought at the Uber Cup, were unable to find their groove during the tie and suffered in the absence of their second singles player Bae Yeon-Ju, who was sidelined by an ankle injury sustained on court Friday night. China has won three-straight Uber Cups and 14 in total since the team first started competing in the tournament in 1984.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Lodha Panel verdict which has recommended suspensions to IPL franchises Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, the BCCI announced the formation of a working committee during their meeting in Mumbai on Sunday. The six-member committee, decided by IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla will study the impact of the sentence and make recommendations to the Government Council after a time period of six weeks. IPL Chairman Rajeev Shukla said the members of the group would be finalised by Monday. "House has entrusted me with the responsibility to make a small group that will take six weeks to submit a report as to how we implement the order and way forward for IPL. How to conduct IPL, how many teams and all stakeholders CAC members, sponsors, broadcasters, state associations, legal experts that report will come to GC and it will go WC which will take decision," Shukla said. "Members will be announced tomorrow [Monday]. We have decided to implement Justice Lodha verdict in spirit and decided to work accordingly. All stakeholders have given their opinion, everybody is of the view that the show must go on. And I reiterate that IPL 9 will be bigger and greater," he asserted. Shukla refused to reveal the details of the meeting and took at shot at former BCCI President Shashank Manohar for his demand of terminating the two franchises. "We cannot divulge the deliberations of the meeting. A sub-group has been constituted which will recommend what needs to be done. A Supreme Court-appointed committee has deliberated on it (the IPL scandal) and after it has given its verdict, I don't think there is scope for anybody else to comment," he said. The Council met in order to deliberate the order passed by the Lodha Committee and came up with the following minutes (according to BCCI's Press release) -: - BCCI respects the verdict of the Lodha Commission and will abide by their decisions, in totality. - The members recognised that there is an urgent need to understand the impact of this decision and the wider ramifications for BCCI in detail, so as to uphold the paramountcy of the game in our country. - The IPL GC hence authorised the Chairman, Shri Rajeev Shukla, to constitute a working group which will study this verdict, in consultation with all our key advisors and explore all the possible measures to be adopted, with an objective to protect the interests of all the stakeholders involved. - This group will work within a time bound period of 6 weeks and report their recommendations to the IPL GC, which will deliberate and share their views with the working committee of the BCCI, for further action.

	<text>KOLKATA: BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is indisposed, is unlikely to attend tomorrow's crucial IPL governing council meeting in Mumbai. "Dalmiya is not going to attend the meeting in Mumbai. Rajeev Shukla (IPL chairman) had already met him and discussed the way forward and the secretary (Anurag Thakur), who will convene the meeting, is also in touch," a source told PTI. However, there is also a buzz that Dalmiya might want to be present at the meeting to put an end to speculations regarding his health and that the Board was being "run" by the secretary. The IPL governing council, headed by Shukla, has called an emergent meeting in Mumbai tomorrow to weigh various options ahead of the next edition of the T20 league after the Supreme Court-appointed panel headed by former Chief Justice of India, R M Lodha, suspended former champions Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for two years for betting by their respective top officials. The storm was triggered by the suspension of CSK and RR and their top officials Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra.

	<text>KUNSHAN (China): Denmark became the first European country to lift the Thomas Cup on Sunday, winning the final 3-2 against Indonesia, the most successful nation in the history of the biennial men's badminton team championship. Indonesia clinched both doubles matches but Viktor Axelsen , Jan Jorgensen and Hans-Kristian Vittinghus won their singles contests to power Denmark to an emotional triumph against the 13-times champions. Vittinghus sealed the landmark victory with a smash down-the-line, triggering wild celebrations in the Denmark camp at the Kunshan Sports Centre in China's Jiangsu province. The 30-year-old looked dazed after his 21-15 21-7 win over Ihsan Maulana Mustofa as team mates, many in tears, mobbed him before forming a celebratory huddle. Axelsen gave Denmark a perfect start when he outplayed Tommy Sugiarto 21-17 21-18 in less than an hour. After conceding the first game, Sugiarto put up a better display in the second and led 18-15 before reeling off six points in a row to put Denmark ahead. Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan won the first doubles against Mads Pieler Kolding and Mads Conrad Petersen 21-18 21-13 to draw level before Jorgensen put Denmark ahead again. The 28-year-old, who missed the semi-final against Malaysia with a hip injury, beat Anthony Ginting 21-17 21-12, celebrating his victory by baring his tattooed torso and throwing his shirt, wristbands and racquet to the crowd. Indonesia flexed their doubles muscle again through Angga Pratama and Ricky Karanda Suwardi to level the contest but Vittinghus remained calm in the final singles to clinch it for Denmark.</text>

	<text>Kobe Bryant scored eight points in what is expected to be his final NBA game in Oakland but it was not enough to prevent the Golden State Warriors from beating the Los Angeles Lakers 116-98 for their 37th consecutive home win on Thursday. Point guard Stephen Curry bombed in 24 of his game-high 26 points on three-pointers, helping the Warriors (37-3) record a seventh straight home victory over the hapless Lakers (9-32). The Oakland fans treated Bryant like one of their own, however, rather than the one that got away in the 1996 draft, during a lengthy pre-game introduction. The Warriors selected North Carolina State center Todd Fuller 11th overall 20 years ago, two spots before Charlotte took Bryant and dealt him to the Lakers. He responded with a poor shooting night, though, going just 4-for-15, but he did find time for six rebounds, three assists, two steals and a blocked shot in 27 minutes. Bryant's eight points were far less than the 27.1 average he accumulated in his first 32 visits to the San Francisco Bay Area. He managed only two points in the third quarter while the Warriors were extending a three-point halftime advantage to 86-72 going into the fourth. Curry had a hoop and two assists in a 13-2, quarter-closing run as the Warriors won for the third time this season in games that immediately followed a loss. Golden State fell 112-110 at Denver on Wednesday. Curry finished 9-for-18 from the field overall and 8-for-16 on three-pointers. Reserves Shaun Livingston (17) and Leandro Barbosa (15) combined for 32 points for the Warriors, who improved to 19-0 at home this season. Power forward Draymond Green, who was rested for Wednesday's loss, had team highs in rebounds (nine), assists (five) and steals (three) to go with seven points. Golden State made half its shots in the game and 13 of its 33 three-point attempts. Los Angeles shot 44.4 percent from the floor, 4-for-24 from outside the arc. Point guard Jordan Clarkson had 22 points and backcourt mate Lou Williams added 21 for the Lakers, who were coming off a home win over New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday. The Lakers also got 14 points apiece off the bench from point guard D'Angelo Russell and power forward Julius Randle. Bryant was much more effective on the defensive end than on offense, limiting Warriors shooting guard Klay Thompson to 12 points on 4-for-14 shooting.</text>

	<text>COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's test opener Kaushal Silva was taken to hospital on Sunday after being hit on the head by a cricket ball while fielding in a domestic match. Sri Lanka Cricket said that Silva was struck during a match in Pallekele. His scans were clear, but he was flown to a hospital in the capital Colombo for further tests and observation, the cricket body added. Silva has played 24 test matches for Sri Lanka and scored 1,404 runs at an average of 31. ``Kaushal was fielding at short leg when he got hit,'' espncricinfo.com quoted national team manager Charith Senanayake as saying. According to Senanayake, Sri Lanka vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal ``swept right onto the back of Kaushal's head. He did take evasive action, but still the ball hit him.'' The website said Silva was wearing a helmet with additional padding, a design introduced for player safety after the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes after being struck by a ball on the head in November 2014. Sunday's match was part of Sri Lanka's preparations for its tour of England next month, with the first of three tests starting at Headingley on May 19.</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: It's not often that a team goes into a major tournament without any specific areas of concern. Team India are in that enviable position as they prepare for the World T20 championship with the first of two warm-up games, against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, here on Thursday evening. Having won back-to-back T20 series against Australia and Sri Lanka, followed by their sixth Asia Cup triumph with an all-win record last Sunday, the Men in Blue will look to maintain their remarkable momentum and consistency. India have a settled unit with all the batsmen among runs and youngsters Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya bowling well in tandem with veteran Ashish Nehra. On Thursday, though, the focus will be on Mohammed Shami, who was ruled out of the Asia Cup with a knee injury. The nippy right-arm medium-pacer's match exposure since last year's World Cup has been limited to a couple of domestic T20 matches for Bengal and a few club games.Yet, the team management has not given up hope and is trying to get him ready before India's tournament opener, against New Zealand in Nagpur on March 15. Team direc tor Ravi Shastri made it amply clear that the pacer is very much in India's scheme of things. "He will be playing tomorrow and we will have a look at how he goes," he said on Wednesday. Mahendra Singh Dhoni did say recently that it will be difficult to accommodate Shami in the playing XI, given the form of the quick bowlers. But the skipper and other members of the think tank will be wary of possible injury issues which could rule out any member of the regular playing XI anytime. Thus, it will be a big boost for Team India if Shami is declared fit for the tournament. "He will have to prove his fitness and the physio is working with him," Dhoni had said. The Bengal pacer bowled for more than half an hour at nets during the team's practice session at Eden on Wednesday afternoon. He took it easy to start with, before bowling from his full run-up and at his usual pace not long after. He shared one of the nets with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pandya, as the trio bowled to Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli. He dislodged Rohit's off stump once as Shastri watched from behind. He tried the yorker a few times, which was appreciated by Kohli. Nehra left the ground with an ice pack wrapped around his right knee. There was no official word on his fitness, and it remains to be seen whether the left-arm pacer plays on Thursday. The West Indies squad did have a weeklong camp in Dubai, but the two warm-up games here (the second one will be against Australia on Sunday) will give them the chance to finalise the combination for their opener, against England. Most of the players in this Caribbean side play T20 across the world in different leagues and have the potential to create a flutter if they can gel as a unit. Skipper Darren Sammy will look to do just that in the warm-up ties before going into the tournament proper.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 4. Ever played 'Stick Cricket' on your mobile? For those who have, the above sequence of runs scored in an innings would bring back some found memories. For those who haven't, jog your memory further back when you might have played 'Brian Lara International Cricket 2007' on your personal computer or gaming console WITH CHEAT CODES ON. The sequence belongs to Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli who clobbered 63 runs off the last 19 balls he faced against Kings XI Punjab Wednesday night. Those aforementioned games are the best when it comes to cricket fantasy, and Kohli's knock of 113 runs off just 50 balls against KXIP was nothing less than a fantasy. In fact, Kohli's stellar batting form this IPL that can only be described as dream-like, something that might happen in a fantasy world. With his incredible knock, Kohli massacred the Kings XI Punjab bowling attack to notch up his 4th T20 ton - all of which came this year and in this season of the IPL. The knock which consisted of 14 fours and eight sixes is surely one of the best IPL innings ever, but what makes it even more special is that Kohli is making a habit of producing bests at a very alarming rate. He now has three tons to his name in the last four matches played at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. He now stands head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to run-making in IPL, by becoming the first player to cross the 800-run mark in a single IPL season. His tally stands at 865 runs from 13 matches. He also broke the 4000-run barrier in IPL history in this match. He is the proud owner of numerous batting records and partnership records in this tournament and yet there seems to be a hunger to do more. From a team's perspective the skipper would know he has to perform at this consistent level, and as he said in the post-match presentation, his main aim is to score runs for the team. If that means he gets all of his boundaries towards the third-man region, then be it. Kohli's batting at the moment is like playing EA Sports Cricket on Easy mode. (BCCL) 75, 79, 33, 80, 100*, 14, 52, 108*, 20, 7, 109, 75*, 113 is what Kohli has scored in 2016 IPL so far. Prior to this, Kohli had scored 625 runs for India in Twenty20 internationals this year. His tally of T20 runs now stands at 1490 runs in 26 matches for the calendar year, which is the fourth-highest score in one year. He is 175 runs adrift of the record of 1665 set by his RCB teammate Chris Gayle in 2015. He has a maximum of three more T20 games, if RCB make it to the playoffs to try and shatter the record. If this is the form he is taking forward, it will be safe to say that Kohli will have another record to his name before the end of the tournament. Enough has been said and written about Kohli the batsman. Wednesday's knock was also something that we all have seen over and over again. However, the thrill of watching him execute the inside out shot over the infield with precision and enough power, to take it over the ropes, is something that can be viewed on loop. That smack to the onside off a fuller one that bisects the fielders at deep midwicket and long-on becomes magical each time you witness it. That squat to any kind of ball on the offside is a delight to watch and as the shot extends itself into a cover drive one can only ask, how did he do that? Kohli did all of that with ease on Wednesday and much more and with good support from Chris Gayle (73 off 32 balls), tore into the KXIP bowling attack. And all this while playing with a split webbing on his left hand that required eight stitches. Again, ask - How on earth did he manage to even hold the bat in the first place? He has the hunger to succeed. To win. To take his team home. To become a better batsman. A better person. He is a Superman, says Gayle, and all of cricketing community might concur. But is he just Superman? His exploits with the bat has surpassed the realm of believability. Kohli himself admitted after the KXIP game that even he could not believe what was happening. He had the confidence to hit every shot for a six or a four, but when he was actually hitting every ball for a six or a four, it was unbelievable for him as well. Superman might be the most popular DC comic character, but he surely is not the most powerful, neither is he is unstoppable. Kohli, however, seems to be at the peak of his powers and near unstoppable. So let's not limit him to mere Superman. Let him be 'Spectre', the cosmic entity of DC universe and the most powerful Superhero of Jack Kirby's fantasy world. And if you are a fan of Stan Lee's Marvel universe, then make him the Thor of cricket, and let a certain SRT be its God.</text>

The Indians continued in the same vein in the second half and pumped in as many as seven more goals. Rani scored three more field goals in the 43rd, 44th and 46th minutes to register a hat-trick and hand India a 9-0 lead. Lilima Minz scored a brilliant field goal in the 51st minute before the Indians added three more goals to their account in the 52nd, 64th and 70th minutes respectively.

	<text>KOLKATA: City's tennis aficionados will get a rare opportunity to witness the game's stars in action when Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Sania Mirza and the legendary Martina Navratilova play an exhibition match here on Wednesday. Titled 'Masters Kolkata', the event is part of the International Premier Tennis League's exhibition tour and the players next travel to Hyderabad and New Delhi on consecutive days ahead of the season of the franchise-based tournament beginning in Kobe on December 2. The build-up tour has its founder and Indian tennis legend Bhupathi teaming up with his former mixed doubles partner and current doubles World No 1 Sania in a rare engagement against Paes, who will play alongside the most successful women's tennis player of all time, Navratilova. Paes and Navratilova had won the mixed doubles title at the 2003 Australian Open and Wimbledon. The exhibition match will also see Bhupathi reuniting with Sania, with whom he had won two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles - Australian Open in 2009 and French Open in 2012. "Season 1 of IPTL brought Indian tennis fans closer to tennis akin to Grand Slam action like never before. Yet, not everyone was able to experience that action up close and personal. The understanding and familiarity between the four of us has resulted in Grand Slam finals appearances and titles won. This will only contribute to the quality of competitive tennis being played on this tour," Bhupathi said. On how the promo tour lines up with his vision for the IPTL, which will begin its second edition on December 2 in Japan, Bhupathi said, "The response from season 1 was overwhelming and season 2 can only exceed expectations. The addition of a new franchise and stars like Rafael Nadal and Leander joining the ranks will surely make for some wonderful tennis on the cards. "Ultimately it is about connecting tennis fans in India and Asia with some of the world's best across the singles and doubles format. This exhibition tour is simply a taster of what to expect from IPTL Season 2," Bhupathi added. It will also be a nostalgia of sorts for the city's tennis fans who relished the three editions of the Sunfeast Open from 2005-07 at the same venue of Netaji Indoor. The event did not take place thereafter as the WTA tier III event became an ITF event.</text>

	<text>SANTIAGO: Chile wrecked Lionel Messi's dream of a first international title with a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over Argentina to end their 99-year wait for a Copa America crown on Saturday. Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez struck the winning spot-kick for Chile, as the hosts clinched a 4-1 shoot-out victory when the game ended goalless after extra time. Sanchez chipped the decisive penalty down the middle past Sergio Romero to spark wild celebrations in front of a 45,000 capacity crowd at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago. Chile took control of the shoot-out when Gonzalo Higuain blazed his penalty over the bar before Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo saved Ever Banega's spot-kick. Argentina captain Messi, aiming to inspire the South American giants to a first international title in 22 years, could only look on distraught as Chile celebrated. The four-time world footballer of the year had repeatedly spoken of his desperation to win a title with Argentina after winning everything at club level with Barcelona. But the 28-year-old superstar was to suffer more disappointment, only 12 months after enduring another agonising extra-time defeat in last year's World Cup final against Germany in Brazil. Chile's win was their first ever victory over Argentina in the Copa America. "It is a dream come true. We have worked so hard for this," said Chile star Arturo Vidal. The midfielder said Chile had been determined to win the Copa America after exiting the World Cup last year on penalties. "We talked about it in Brazil that we were going to win the Copa America," Sanchez said. "This is really a great generation, we deserve this." Chile's Alexis Sanchez holds the Copa America trophy as he celebrates with his teammates following their victory over Argentina in their Copa America 2015 final soccer match at the National Stadium in Santiago. (Reuters photo) Chile's Argentina-born coach Jorge Sampaoli said his side had deserved to win. "We had to play a great game against one of the world's best teams for the quality of players," Sampaoli said. "We should have won in 90 minutes, but ended up getting justice." Argentina's players meanwhile were left pondering another heartbreaking loss. Midfielder Javier Mascherano has now played in three losing Argentina teams in Copa America finals, and was also a member of the team beaten in the World Cup final. "Three Copa America finals, three defeats; I can't explain the losing streak," a dejected Mascherano said. "We just didn't seem to have that little bit of luck that you sometimes need to have to win in finals. Is it karma? I don't know." Argentina coach Gerardo Martino meanwhile lamented his side's failure to take chances. "They were very clear chances that should have changed the outcome of the game," Martino said. Earlier, Chile had begun the final at a ferocious pace before Argentina gradually managed to gain a foothold in the game. While Chile pressed forward relentlessly and launched a series of forays into Argentinian territory, it was the tournament favourites who had the better chances in the first half. Argentina almost grabbed an opener in the 20th minute when Sergio Aguero met a Messi free-kick with a close range header that Bravo parried away. On the stroke of half-time Argentina probed again and Javier Pastore set up Ezequiel Lavezzi whose shot was blocked by Bravo. The second half followed a similar pattern, with clear-cut chances thin on the ground as defences remained on top. Sanchez went close for Chile on 82 minutes but hooked his volley just wide of the post. Argentina almost snatched a dramatic victory in the dying seconds with a well-worked move that began after Messi skipped clear of the Chile defence and released Lavezzi on the left flank. Lavezzi found Higuain - on for Aguero - at the far post but the Napoli striker couldn't finish from a tight angle and shot into the side netting as Chile escaped. In extra-time Sanchez almost punished a rare slip by Mascherano but shot over the bar. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>Scrapping of the Special Area Games programme cut short the careers of Siddi athletes, many of whom were forced to look for alternative jobs. After years, plans of a relaunch have made the community hopeful again I won battles with demons who haunted our village; I fought with my parents, who were initially apprehensive of sending me to a city to pursue athletics. In my journey of becoming an international athlete, I fought as much on the track as I did off it, but in the end the system failed us. It stirred our passion and then sucked out our energy." As she sat in her modest South Western Railway quarters in Hubballi, Kamala Siddi's smile lit up the room, but the pain in her voice was hard to miss. Silence punctuated her sentences when the former international athlete spoke of shattered dreams, unconquered medals and a career cut short by government apathy. She's is among the many athletes from the Siddi community who were touted as India's Olympic hopefuls in the 1980s and 1990s, but were left to pick up the pieces of their lives after the government's ambitious Special Area Games programme was scrapped without notice. With the Sports Authority of India preparing to relaunch it, the community is hoping the government isn't making promises they can't keep. Again. Looking back at her career which started by running between Manchikeri and Chikotti villages in Yallapur taluk, Hubballi, Kamala said, "As children we were often told stories of ghosts in the forest between my village and school in neighbouring Chikotti. Out of fear, I sprinted to my school everyday, covering a distance of 1km. That fuelled my love for running." The turning point came in 1989 when Kamala was picked for the second batch of the SAG scheme. After a month of training in Delhi, the group of 40 campers was pruned to 20 and sent to Bengaluru for training. "Initially, it was smooth sailing. We were introduced to a new life in a city where we saw equipment and sportswear for the first time. We embraced it all with the hope of a bright future. But that faded with time," rued Kamala, who represented the country in 100m hurdles, long jump and high jump at events like the SAF Games. After serving as a constable in the Karnataka police department, Kamala quit in 1993 to join the South Western Railway, where she is the chief office superintendent in the electricity department. Kamala, who continued to run even after she embraced motherhood, finally gave up in 2003, but regrets the course of her career. "I didn't want to quit. I dreamt of being an Olympian, but without support it remained a dream. What makes it worse is that I knew I had the talent to make it to the sporting extravaganza. I hope no athlete ever goes through our pain. There is no bigger tragedy than the death of a dream," said Kamala, her eyes brimming with tears. Despite all the darkness, Kamala sees hope when she talks about her daughters Pratiksha, 12, and Nimiksha, 10, who coyly flank their mother as she talks about winning a gold, two silvers and a bronze at the 1994 World Police Games in Melbourne. "I want my daughters to realize my Olympic dreams but also want them to be well-educated because it's important to balance both," she said. A stone's throw away lives Siddi athlete Louis Ishant Brigi, who was among the first batch recruits. Brigi, a long and triple jumper has been through the grind of the system, and is not overly keen about his two sons taking after him. "I want my kids to concentrate on studies first. But I won't discourage them from taking up sport," he said. With the new scheme on the anvil, Brigi is willing to help. "When they started dropping athletes from camps, I quit the scheme before I was left in the lurch. I moved to Gujarat for 10 years from 1993; it was a tough life because of lack of planning on the government's part. About 10 of us were lucky to have jobs but the others returned to villages to become labourers and farmers. But I want to put all that behind and if they want, I'll be happy to coach at the new centre," he said. Olympic legend Emil Zatopek once said, "An athlete must run with hope in his heart and dreams in his head". This 400-year-old community is again living a dream with the hope of producing an Olympian.

	<text>ASTANA (Kazakhstan): Asian Games bronze-medallist L Sarita Devi failed to qualify for the Olympics after she went down in her second round bout of the AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships here on Saturday. Earlier, five-time world champion MC Mary Kom (51kg) too lost her bout and missed the Rio ticket. Sarita (60kg) was beaten 0-3 by Victoria Torres in the second round of an event from where only the semifinalists in the three Olympic categories would make the cut for the upcoming Rio Games. The only Olympic hope left for India in the event is Pooja Rani (75kg), who is in the prequarterfinals after winning her opening bout on Friday. In the evening session, Sarita started off confidently against Torres but the Mexican's persistence helped her clinch the bout. Both the boxers went all out from the word go and nearly exhausted each other by the third round. Sarita was ahead in the opening two rounds on split decisions but Torres roared back in the next two to oust the veteran Indian, who was eyeing her maiden Olympic berth. The tournament is the final qualifying event for women boxers in the three Olympic categories of 51kg, 60kg, and 75kg and has 12 Rio tickets on offer.</text>

	<text>The Buddh International Circuit resembled a giant carnival as trucks, singers, dancers, and thousands of fans thronged the arena for a truck racing event, a vibrant event in which Indian and international truck racers competed on the track. A number of stars visited the track to soak in the action and wish luck to the truckers. Cricketer Virender Sehwag interacted with the Indian drivers before the race, and said, "It's a sport of focus and risk and I am happy to see that Indian participants are here as well. This is not just entertaining but draws huge crowds as well." Narain Karthikeyan, the first Indian to race in Formula One, also made a comeback to the Buddh International Circuit, albeit as a spectator. "It's great that they have brought Indian drivers this time. The atmosphere is great and I love the buzz around here," he said. The cultural performances drew applause as a number of stars performed on makeshift stages atop trucks in the middle of the race track. The opening ceremony saw artistes displaying Oriental, Brazilian as well as ethnic Indian dance forms. Neeti Mohan kicked off the show by singing some of her hits, getting a capacity crowd in the grandstand to sing along. Rapper Badshah brought the house down with tracks like DJ Wale Babu and Chull. An energetic song and dance routine by singer Garima Yajnik capped the evening. Talking about the event, Neeti said, "I've never performed at something like this. The energy was crazy and the atmosphere electric. I wasn't expecting something of this scale, but this was tremendous." There was plenty of racing action as well. For the first time, the event featured Indian drivers, with the aim of taking Indian truck racing to the world. Twelve Indian drivers competed in two eight-lap races, with Jagat Singh and Nagarjuna winning their respective races. Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy gave away the awards to the winners. The race also saw participation from 12 international truck racers in a 20-lap final feature race. In the absence of defending champion Stuart Oliver, British racer David Jenkins pipped the duo of Richard Collett and Graham Powell to win the third season of the championship. Numerous collisions between Collett and Powell on the final laps helped Jenkins win his first title in India. Crashes and collisions were not uncommon in the event - Mat Summerfield, a hot favourite, lost seven places after his truck spun on a corner. Rohan, a racing enthusiast, said, "This was the perfect event because there was something for everyone. My girlfriend came here for the performance, and I came for the racing. Can't wait to be back here next year!"</text>

	<text>Bengaluru: Sunil Chhetri is a man who hates to lose  whether it is while leading the national football team and Bengaluru FC on the field, or while playing wagers with his teammates on his PlayStation. On Monday, however, Chhetri had a daunting task ahead of him that would challenge that trait  to win a point against the queen of Indian badminton, Saina Nehwal. "I hope she takes it easy," Chhetri said, as he sauntered in to the Karnataka Badminton Association courts. Saina had just finished cooling down after her morning practice session, but was more than happy to oblige the Indian captain for a quick sparring game. Chhetri, surprisingly, had all the right moves for a footballer who dabbled in badminton. In February this year, he had teamed up with Tarun Kona to take on India's top doubles stars Ashwini Ponnappa and Jwala Gutta and left onlookers impressed. This time too, Chhetri didn't disappoint. Beginning slowly with long rallies, the 30-year-old began leaping into smashes and powerful returns to unsettle his Hyderabadi opponent. Saina, however, stood rooted to her spot, calmly returning each shot with a smile. "It's not turning out as I thought," Chhetri huffed. But finally, the BFC striker did get a breakthrough, launching into a stray shot from Saina to finish with a venomous cross-court return. Chhetri let out a cry of triumph and a smiling Saina looked a bit ruffled. "Aapne toh shuttle hi tod diya (You've broken the shuttle)," the 24-year-old quipped. What followed was something that Chhetri probably had coming for him. The world No. 4 showed a glimpse of her real game, raining down smashes after smashes on Chhetri as the Blues skipper bravely stood his ground. "The last one went right through me," he said, as Saina's thundering shots whizzed past him. Chhetri finally called it quits, shook hands, congratulated Saina and handed her a personalized Bengaluru FC home jersey. "We are proud to have you as part of the BFC family. You must come to watch our matches and support us," he told the shuttler. Saina was in awe of Chhetri's talent in the sport. "I never expected he would play so well actually. He has good wristwork and nice smashes, mainly because he's powerful player. Obviously it will help both of us if we keep playing like this together, because both our games involves a lot of running," she said. So will this new association get her hooked to football? "I'm not a big fan of football. If I had to pick a favourite player, I'd say Cristiano Ronaldo because he looks good (laughs). But now after getting this beautiful jersey, I'll try my best to keep track of BFC's progress and support them. It feels great to be part of the team," said Saina.</text>

And I'm looking forward to the match tomorrow," the world no. 18 said. Verma said his motto would be to not think about the rival archer. "If I think about the other archer, I lose," Verma said. "If I win, I'll be grinning." Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>Udaipur: The minister for urban development and local self-government (LSG) Rajpal Singh Shekhawat said that each city has its own strength in terms of heritage, geographical location and environment. There is no specific technique or universal formula for developing smart cities. The experts and stakeholders should create their own model in creating one, however, they should ensure that the governance should be citizen friendly and cost effective. It should also expand housing opportunities for all. Shekhawat was speaking as chief guest of the 'Smart City Conclave' held here at City Palace on Saturday. The event was organised by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in association with Department of LSG, Udaipur Municipal Corporation and Udaipur Smart City Ltd. The objective was to discuss the challenges and opportunities towards smart city programme, sharing best practices, evolving technological and managerial solutions. "Smart City is also about inclusive growth, quality of life, happiness index, convenience of living and being green," the minister said. Some cities may have been 'smart' earlier but to be counted as 'smart' in 2016 was different in the context of having planned core infrastructure as well as a clean and sustainable environment, he added. Speaking on the occasion, home minister Gulab Chand Kataria urged the citizens and the local bodies to take it as a challenge to make Udaipur a top quality smart city in country.Peter Taksoe-Jensen, Denmark Ambassador to India, assured all technical support to the authorities in developing the smart city on Copenhagen model. "Though funding will be received from international banks as well as from other sources, it is fundamentally important for the city to generate its own funds through different cases of businesses and viable projects," Jensen emphasized. Mayor Chandra Singh Kothari pointed out the challenges like sewerage, parking, traffic and drinking water problems in making the smart city. Manjit Singh, principal secretary of LSG informed about the progress of the mission. "Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) have already been created and the Project Management Consultants (PMC) will be appointed by the end of this month and the work will begin by 15 June," he claimed. Delivering his theme address, professor Jagan Shah, director, National Institute of Urban Affairs said that the mission for smart cities was very clear in its objective that the identity of the city in terms of heritage and economic activities will be retained while strengthening the core infrastructure and improving the quality of life. The theme paper on the Udaipur Smart City, prepared by Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (IIDC) was released during the inaugural session. It focuses on strategic focus, vision statement and financial plan and even has a SWOT analysis. Later in the plenary sessions, presentations on sanitation, waste and water management, technologies and innovations etc were made by experts.</text>

	<text>Vadodara: Former IPS officer, D G Vanzara, who returned to the state last month after a court order, will be felicitated in the city on Sunday. The cop, who is key accused in the encounters of Ishrat Jahan and Sohrabuddin Sheikh, will also address the citizens at Sayaji Nagargruh in Akota. Vanzara has been invited by Gujarat Asmita Manch, an organization formed by city's former VHP joint-secretary and advocate Niraj Jain. "We will also take out a rally from Nyay Mandir that will pass through Raopura, Sayajigunj, Alkapuri and culminate in Akota. Vanzara will address the audience in the town hall," Jain, president of Gujarat Asmita Manch, told TOI. When asked why he decided to honour Vanzara, Jain said, "Vanzara has protected Gujaratis by killing terrorists. He was framed and sent to jail by the earlier government at Centre. But now the truth is out that Ishrat was a terrorist. Vanzara is Gujarat's pride."</text>

	<text>Indologist Wendy Doniger is the author of seminal books on Hinduism and mythology. She will be speaking at Times Lit Fest-Delhi this weekend. She tells Nalin Mehta that protests by writers can be effective, book bans don't work and that Hinduism's great tradition of debate is alive and well. Do you agree with the writers and film-makers who returned their awards to protest against rising intolerance in India? As someone whose book was withdrawn under a Congress government, do you think this is actually the case? Well, of course, my book was not banned, under any government; a lawsuit was brought by a group of private individuals against me and my publisher, and the publisher agreed to stop publishing the book in India. In fact, the book, the Hindus: An Alternative History, has now been republished by another publisher and is freely available. This seems to me to mean that protests really can be effective; the international protest against Penguin's action in withdrawing the book was inspiring, and ultimately bore fruit. So, too, I believe that the writers' and filmmakers' protests have rallied many of India's intellectuals to stand up against the rising intolerance of dissident views. Do book-bans ever work? I don't know if it's possible to generalize; some banned books may indeed have disappeared. But I can speak with confidence about my own case: the publicity generated by the attempt to keep it out of print made it a best seller, always available both in paper copies (in brown paper wrappers) and in (illegal) PDFs, and now again in a new paperback edition. Are Hinduism's traditions of samvaad under increasing threat? This is the real danger, I think. The open-mindedness and tolerance that has been the pride of India for centuries is seriously threatened by the legal actions and physical violence that have been directed against individuals whose words and actions were unacceptable to a narrow and narrow-minded band of Hindutva adherents. But recent developments give me new hope that the great Indian tradition of debate is alive and well. First the return of the awards by writers and film-makers, and now the emergence of a group of 46 scholars, Indian historians, who have announced their determination to engage in serious discussions about historiography with what they characterize as the "leftist" school of Indian history. I would love to be a part of such a serious discussion about genuine issues, a welcome change from the irresponsible and unscholarly attacks that those who oppose Hindutva historiography have been subjected to in the past. I see this as real progress toward a genuine intellectual encounter and I welcome it. Do you think the traditions of dissent and debate inherent within Hinduism are essentially inimical to Hindutva? I certainly do. Hindutva insists on a single, monolithic, unified Hinduism, and does not tolerate any vision or discussion of Hinduism that includes other aspects of the culture. There can therefore be no debate within Hindutva, since there is only one acceptable argument. Such a view by definition excludes most of Hinduism, including the interaction of contrasting views. An important example is the recent persecution of people-primarily but not only Muslims-who eat beef. The Hindutva assumption is that no Hindus eat beef, whereas in reality some Hindus do and other Hindus do not - the issue of beef, and cows, has a complex and tricky history in India. I was recently misquoted on this subject by a professor who claimed, on the basis of remarks that he says he overheard at an academic dinner party in my honor, that I believed that Partition might have been averted had Gandhi not been so reverent to cows. This is of course nonsense, and not what I was saying; the situation is far more complex than that. But Gandhi was indeed a supporter of the Cow Protection Society, despite rather than because of the anti-Muslim agendas that it had then and still has now. And those agendas contributed to the ultimate failure of his sincere efforts to work with Jinnah to integrate Muslims and Hindus and to avoid Partition. Complexities of this sort, which require an open mind and a sophisticated understanding of history, are simply ignored by advocates of Hindutva. The idea of samvaada is negotiation and nuance, which are destroyed by reductionist caricatures of anyone's views. Your latest book, 'The Mare's Trap' extols the Kamasutra as a landmark of Sanskrit secular literature. Why do you think so? The Kamasutra is certainly one of the earliest and most enduring Indian texts of a secular nature. Its scientific attitude to debate in general, and debate about the life of a cultivated urban-dweller in particular, is a model of scholarly writing. Argument is an intrinsic part of it; major points are debated, pro and con, until the author states what he thinks is the best view. The Kamasutra ignores caste entirely, and its attitude toward women is stunningly liberated, ignoring many of the more restrictive attitudes of traditional dharma. It is an amazingly modern book.</text>

	<text>Working professionals in India spend most of their time in a day sitting as against being active, revealed a report conducted by Max Bupa Walk for Health Survey 2016. The survey, the first of its kind study on walking behaviour, is based on data of over 1300 Indians across four cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Jaipur belonging to different backgrounds - working professionals, housewives, students and senior citizens. According to the study, 38 percent of the working population spends time sitting, while only 20 percent devote time to walking. Long working hours emerged as the biggest barrier to walking amongst professionals. The survey also revealed pollution as a key deterrent to walking with 16 percent Indians not taking a walk regularly due to rising pollution levels. "Max Bupa Walk for Health Survey 2016 has revealed an alarming reality that most of the working population in India spends 40 percent of its time in a day sitting. A simple yet effective way to improve one's health is a 30 minute daily walk," said Max Bupa Managing Director and CEO, Ashish Mehrotra. The survey showed that 8 percent suffered from blood pressure, back problems (15 percent), weak eyesight (14 percent) and overall weakness (12 percent) who do not walk regularly. Obesity emerged as the prime disease affecting housewives who do not walk (14 percent) while working women who do not walk suffer from weak eyesight (21 percent). However, 78 percent agree that walking helps to guard against lifestyle diseases. According to the findings, 44 percent of housewives started walking post getting diagnosed with diseases like blood pressure and sugar. "Max Bupa Walk for Health encourages people to take up walking for a healthier and a more successful life." added Anika Agarwal, head-marketing, Max Bupa. According to the survey, 74 percent Mumbaikars and 73 percent Delhiites prefer walking over other exercises, followed by Pune at 65 percent and Jaipur at 64 percent. While Delhi (47 percent), Mumbai (38 percent) and Jaipur (32 percent) walk for a good heart, Pune (38 percent) walks to lose weight.</text>

	<text>It's summer time and you must be planning your vacations already. While you pack all the essentials, don't forget to add a hat to your checklist. Fedora: Although this one reminds us of Indiana Jones, it's quite popular among women. It gives an edgy look to the feminine attire. Cloche: It was popular in the 1920s, but is now back in fashion. It's a classic accessory to go with a plain top and blue jeans. Pillbox: It is a perfect accessory to go with a semi-formal mid-length dress for an outdoor brunch party.</text>

	<text>Julia Roberts shocked everyone at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday when she walked the red carpet without any footwear. Dressed to kill in a vintage black gown, which she paired with an emerald and diamond neckpiece, her decision to not wear stilettos is now being considered as fashion rebellion. The move comes as a surprise as last year the festival's organisers had allegedly turned away a group of women from a film screening for wearing flat footwear. The festival follows a strict dress code wherein celebs are expected to wear high heels. The event, which was dubbed 'Heelgate', caused widespread outcry in fashion circles and received backlash from several celebrities. Celebs who decided to forgo their footwear on the red carpet: Cameron Diaz At the premiere of her film in 2003, the actress was the cynosure of all eyes as she walked down the red carpet minus shoes. She unwittingly upstaged her co-stars Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. Kristen Stewart The Twilight star has often been spotted switching her stilettos for sneakers. But on her recent red carpet stints, Kristen has ditched her heels and has no qualms going barefoot. Lena Dunham Whether it's the Met Gala or Emmy Awards after party, this actress-writer has proudly walked the red carpet without shoes, much to the surprise of onlookers and dismay of the fashion police! Shailene Woodley In 2014, The Fault In Our Stars actress, dressed in a low-cut gown for her film's premiere, not just gave her shoes a complete miss, she reportedly also walked all the way back to her hotel barefoot. Zooey Deschanel Though the actress wore strappy sandals to match her gown at an event in 2005, she eventually decided to choose comfort over style and took off her footwear as she posed for the shutterbugs.</text>

	<text>You'd think that in a city like Chennai, flowy dresses might be a strict no-no. Who's gonna deal with the heat and the accompanying complications of wearing a floorlength dress in exquisite fabrics? But the fashionistas of this city won't take things lying down. If there ever was an opportunity to make a style statement, they would be right at the forefront of it. And that's what we got to witness at a few formal and informal parties in Chennai where the ladies decided to go all haute-couture on us. Resort wear has now made its way into the city's party circuit as well, thanks to the drop in the temperature. Take for instance, how Aditi has added a touch of glam to her avatar by draping herself in a stunningly shaded resort dress. Incorporating a simple cut and wild colours, she paints a picture of elan. On the other side, you have Sofia, who has opted for golds and browns to keep her haute quotient on top of the ranks. The dress complements her mane perfectly and she beefs it up with matching shoes. You could try something on these lines as well. For those on the plus side, make sure you opt for garments that don't show off more than you really intend to. For those blessed with a great figure, go wild with your imagination.</text>

	<text>The harsh sunlight in summers can take a toll on your eyes. It can make our eyes more prone to infections and damage caused by the UV rays. For adequate eye care, here's what you should keep in mind when you are out in the sun. Choose sunglasses with adequate UV protection It is not enough to have dark or tinted sunglasses to sheild your eyes, they need to be 100% UV-protected to prevent harmful effects of the UV rays. Check for the standard mark of certification to get maximum eye health benefit. Also go for larger frames which cover most of the sensitive area near the eye too. Continue wearing them even if one of the days turns overcast and cloudy. Keep yourselves well hydrated Drink adequate water, which should be minimum of two litres a day. It helps the eyes to maintain a healthy balance of fluid, preventing them from becoming dehydrated and irritated. They also give bring in a healthy sparkle to your eyes. Blinking more often helps The eye is surrounded by fluid, that washes away the dust around it with every blink. Minute allergens and hot air does not just irritate the eyes, but also causes dryness of the eye, so try blinking a few times more to increase the moisture in the eyes. Keep your eyes clean While washing your face, keep your eyes open and splash water to clean them too. Do it as often as you can to keep them moist and hydrated.</text>

	<text>It is incredible what a single night of blissful, uninterrupted sleep can earn you  a productive day at work, excellent (and faster) work-out results. If children get a good night's sleep every day, they are also likely to grow taller, say experts. However, an alarming increase in sleep disorders in India indicate that Indians are struggling to reap the benefits of a good night's sleep. "We seem to be content to sacrifice our sleep for success," says Dr Vikas Agrawal, senior ENT surgeon and sleep apnoea specialist, adding, "The problem is even more apparent in metropolitan cities where younger generations are working harder than ever to keep their heads afloat. Ten years ago, we didn't have as much work as we do now, and we did sleep better." But it's not the only reason behind the country's general state of sleeplessness. Here are six small, but vital things that are messing with our sleep, and why it's so important to ensure they're taken care of right away. Staying Up Late Many Indians end up compromising on the essential seven to eight hours of sleep (the optimum number of hours one needs to sleep for on an average) by simply staying up late, and then having to wake up early the next day. "This is especially noticeable on weekends, when one sleeps late and wakes up early on Monday, feeling tired even though there is an entire week of work stretching out in front of them," says senior neurologist and sleep specialist Dr Manvir Bhatia. "The best time to sleep is between 10 pm and 11 pm, judging, of course, on the time you wake up," says Alphonse Reddy, who founded India's first online sleep start-up. The company also conducted a survey recently, covering approximately 350 families in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. It was found that Mumbai boasted of the most number of people who slept well after midnight. 32.72 per cent of Bengalureans sleep by 10 pm, compared to 10 per cent in Delhi and 12.8 per cent in Mumbai. It also said that Delhites lead the pack in this regard with a late night meal and a heavy one at that, which is directly related to a restless night, resulting in obesity and heart issues. Eating Late Lying down on a full stomach can put pressure on your heart and lungs, making it difficult to breathe, and causes fitful sleep. According to Dr P Vijaya Krishnan, the Maharajas of Rajasthan knew what they were doing by consuming their meals right before sunset (between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm). "Keep a gap of an hour-and-a-half between bedtime and your meals," he advises. Dr Bhatia agrees, revealing that most of her patients eat late because they work late and want to come home to a hot meal, instead of consuming it in the office. "As Indians, we cannot sacrifice the luxury of a meal eaten in the comfort of our home to signal that the day is finally over. To sleep well, one needs to unwind and release the day's tensions," she adds. Television, laptops, comfort foods and drinking are not the ideal way to relax or unwind from a hard day's work. People also end up giving to drowsiness after work or right after dinner, instead of waiting for bedtime  not a good plan, because you'll wake up later in the night and have trouble falling asleep. Exercising and reading books (print, not on your electronic gadgets) are sure-fire ways of unwinding, especially the former because it encourages the release of endorphins, or 'happy' hormones. Dr Bhatia also recommends deep breathing, meditation and Jacobson's relaxation techniques. "Simply lie down and close your eyes if you cannot sleep. The idea is to adopt a pattern that your body recognises so it will get accustomed to falling asleep," she says, "But none of this is possible if you insist on continue working once you are home or stressing yourself out." A Heavy Dinner "Not only do working people eat late, they also eat a heavy meal that can often be oily or hard to digest," says Dr Krishnan, "This can cause an acid reflux  the stomach releases more acid for digestion. Once you lie down, thanks to gravity, the sphincter muscle opens up, and allows acid to travel far more easily to your throat, inducing a burning sensation that will wake you up." Ruling out consuming any caffeine-based drinks before bed, he adds, "A lot of Indians also partake in smoking post a heavy meal. While smoking is bad in any form, it acts as a stimulant, further discouraging sleep, even though people believe it will help them sleep better after a meal." Consuming Vast Quantities Of Alcohol "I have observed that Indians tend to drink too much in the evenings," says Dr Bhatia. Ingesting vast quantities of alcohol can severely disrupt one's sleep, even though it may initially appear to help you pass out. "What's worse is that we tend to consume our drinks before our meals unlike our Western compatriots, who will eat their meal early and then head out for a drink," says Dr Bhatia, "Not only does one get drunk faster on an empty stomach, he/she delays the meal even further, and passes out immediately after." Drinking alcohol also increases your appetite, so the chances of eating heavy are high. "Once the alcohol levels in your body drop, you end up waking several times, spoiling any chances you had of getting a normal night's sleep," she says. Sleeping Next To Gadgets "The more the gadgets around you, the more the disturbances," says Dr Reddy. The survey showed that over 90 per cent of all bedrooms in metropolitan cities have a mobile phone. Self-luminous gadgets suppress melatonin, a natural hormone made by the pineal gland that induces sleep. "If this part of the circadian rhythm is constantly disrupted, it can lead to different disorders, including sleep apnoea, a common but deadly killer," says Dr Krishnan. Studies have shown that 30 to 40 per cent of the working population, particularly those in high-stress jobs such as corporate executives, medical professionals and cops, don't sleep well. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), characterised by respiratory difficulties during sleep, affects nine to 21 per cent of women and 24 to 31 per cent of men in the country. It has been linked to heart disease, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of cholesterol fat in blood) and insulin resistance.</text>

	<text>Believe it or not, new research has pointed out that the human attention span is now less than that of a goldfish, which is about eight seconds! Blame it on the overdose of the internet, social media, console games, online shopping, multi-channel TV, texting and whatnot, a normal person with sound mental and physical faculties now finds it difficult to hold a thought for a long time. This overstimulation is also partly the reason a considerable percentage of people today are 'chronically' bored, whether they are at home, in a classroom or at the workplace, despite having perpetual access to a plethora of high-intensity modes of entertainment at their fingertips. Most of us are so occupied with the screen-tapping schema all day long that regular activities such as commuting, reading reports, sitting in meetings, attending lectures or doing paperwork appear too mundane and slow-paced for our hardwired brains. And that's not all  chronic boredom may also lead to negative outcomes such as anti-social behaviour, overeating, gambling and drug use. "My job involves a lot of screen-time, meaning most of my working hours are spent tapping away at my keyboard. I also enjoy shopping online during my free time. Earlier, I could sit for hours reading a book, but now even flipping through the pages of a magazine puts me to sleep," says Preeti Maheshwari, an SEO executive at a city-based company. Giving an insight into the phenomenon, psychotherapist Tasneem Nakhoda says, "It's a rather strange observation that certain people do find themselves getting bored a lot faster, despite having so many sources at their disposal to keep themselves occupied." According to her, a number of factors could be fueling it  namely, a lack of inner peace; perhaps the individual is not getting enough of what actually appeals to his/her interest; and the constant feeling of having 'seen it all'. Too much dependence on various forms of online entertainment is also a major marker, the absence of which can create a void leading to boredom. Ways to alleviate the effects of tedium Try to avoid being too engrossed in your smartphone all the time Engage yourself in activities that involve your neural systems  such as cooking, painting, knitting or a sport Do your household chores Spend time with your pet (adopt a puppy or a kitten, if you don't have one yet) Try learning a new skill, maybe a hobby you managed to get time for earlier Concentrate on your current tasks</text>

	<text>At a time when Delhi is emerging not just a capital of politics but also as India's cultural capital, the countdown has begun for the city's biggest, first- of- its- kind, literature festival. The Times Lit Fest, Delhi which begins this Saturday (November 28) is presented by Rajnigandha. The festival will bring together authors and philosophers, politicians and poets, activists and scholars on one platform to exchange ideas and ideologies. The stellar line up this year includes globally celebrated authors and public intellectuals such as Amitav Ghosh, Niall Ferguson, Sunil Khilnani and Jagdish Bhagwati. "I am greatly looking forward to being at the Times Lit Fest. Delhi certainly deserves its own literature festival," says author Amitav Ghosh speaking to TOI. Ghosh returns to the city where he was a student and from where he began his literary journey. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Times Lit Fest-Delhi will encourage diverse viewpoints. While eminent economist Jagdish Bhagwati will reflect on his idea of the global economy, former minister Jairam Ramesh promises to offer an alternate viewpoint. While internationally renowned historian Niall Ferguson promises a global sweep of history and international diplomacy, the equally acclaimed author of 'The Idea Of India', Sunil Khilnani will showcase 50 Indians who have contributed to creating the ideas about India. Popular best- selling authors like Amish will offer glimpses into how younger Indians identify with mythology and legend. In a year when political books made headlines,leading journalists will offer their perspectives on elections in India from general elections to assembly elections in Bihar. There will also be a strong representation of regional writers and poets reflecting the richly plural cultural heritage of India's capital. In the city of politics, the present finance minister Arun Jaitley and his immediate predecessor P. Chidambaram will explore ideas of the law, jurisprudence and democracy. At a time when dissent has led to a passionate national debate on tolerance, writers Taslima Nasrin and historian Wendy Doniger will offer contrasting perspectives. From a presentation on Sachin Tendulkar biography to airplane poetry, from spiritual teacher Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev's evocations of the divine to Kiran Nagarkar's illuminations on the historical novel, Times Lit Fest-Delhi will showcase a gamut of cultural expressions and be a truly people's festival. Set amidst the nostalgic colonial architecture of the Maidens hotel, the Fest's aim is to bridge the gap between the old and the new Delhi, between high culture and the aam admi. Times Lit Fest-Delhi promises to be a trend setter by redefining the idea of Delhi and of literature festivals.</text>

	<text>South Africa commemorated World Malaria Day on Monday, pledging to eliminate the disease by 2018. The country is set to raise awareness about malaria prevention and to focus on the achievements, progress and challenges in the fight against malaria, the health department said. It has embarked on awareness and educational campaigns that include radio campaigns, community events, door-to-door campaigns and distribution of pamphlets at shopping centres before and during World Malaria day, Xinhua news agency reported. South Africa plans to eliminate malaria by achieving an incidence of zero cases of locally transmitted malaria by 2018. South Africa registered 11,700 cases of the disease in 2014, down from 64,000 in 2000 with most cases coming from areas bordering Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In a report marking World Malaria Day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that through targeted action and cross-border collaboration, South Africa has the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. WHO estimates that 21 countries are in a position to achieve this goal, including six countries in the African region, where the burden of the disease is the heaviest. These countries are Algeria, Botswana, Cape Verde, Comoros, South Africa and Swaziland.</text>

	<text>People in India and Ukraine spend just over 13 hours a week cooking, compared to the international average of less than six and a half hours each week, a recent study revealed. They are followed by South Africa, where its citizens, on an average spend nine and a half hours on culinary activities, Indonesia where people spend more than eight hours a week and Italy seven hours a week. The research, conducted by Germany-based market researcher GfK, said the countries where people spent the least amount of time cooking each week were Brazil (slightly more than five hours), Turkey (slightly less than five hours) and South Korea (less than four hours), possibly due to the popularity of their inexpensive street food carts. The research was conducted by interviewing over 27,000 people aged 15 and above in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine and the US. The study further said globally 29 percent of people claim to have great knowledge and experience about food and cooking -- but this was again led by women at 34 percent, compared to just a quarter (25 percent) of men. "Breaking this down into individual countries, South Africa and India top the list, with around half of people (50 and 48 percent, respectively) agreeing, or agreeing strongly, that this applies to them. "Also in the top five are Turkey and Ukraine at 40 percent each and Indonesia at 38 percent," the study said. It further revealed that women spend over seven and a half hours per week for preparing the dishes while men spend five hours a week.</text>

	<text>Celebrity chef Vikas Khanna talks about cooking for world leaders, his new recipe book and signing off in 2020 What do you tell a chef like Vikas Khanna, who's ticked off so many boxes? A Michelin star? Check. He has one for the New York restaurant, Junoon, of which he's now culinary ambassador. A best-selling author? Check. He's been churning out books with much alacrity -the most recent being Indian Harvest: Classic and Contemporary Vegetarian Dishes. A TV personality? Been there, done that. He's the host of Masterchef India, Junior Masterchef India and Twist of Taste -all of which trade on his boyish features, his kitchen prowess and his relatable personality.Philanthropist? Well, he has his own foundation, SAKIV (South Asian Kids Infinite Vision) and he's been associated with the Smile Foundation in India for over 3 years. Oh, and he hobnobs with the Dalai Lama. Khanna was in the city last week for a charity cook-off hosted by the Grand Hyatt and the Smile Foundation. After spending an afternoon judging dishes created by personalities such as Anjolie Ela Menon, Nachiket Barve and Manasi Scott, we finally manage to have a chat with the celebrity chef. Khanna's clientele includes world leaders like President Obama and Bill Clinton. He has also, most recently, cooked for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Yet, his fondest memories of food come from Amritsar, where he spent many hours cooking with his grandmoth er. During the interview, Khanna switches between Hindi and English, with a Punjabi accent, and pulls off a wickedly good imitation of how Americans speak. As he digs into a bowl of salad (arugula, pomegranate seeds, barley, parmesan shavings and feta, if you must know), our conversation veers towards the supremacy that the West places on creativity and innovation. We prod him about his famous clients and Khanna explains that there is a `protocol to be followed' while serving them. "Someone may be lactose intolerant but can have yoghurt, while someone else may be allergic to cumin. Their secretaries call my secretary to let me know their exact requirements," he explains. Planning the menu is a tough task, he admits, but one that he embraces. "Every day, you represent your motherland. Every dish you make and every word you speak is an opportunity to represent India," he says. Cooking Indian food abroad was a learning curve, says the chef, as contrary to galas abroad, the ones in India usually serve world cuisine."It just makes us seem more welltravelled to our guests. But that perception is slowing changing." We talk about Utsav, his new recipe book which celebrates festivals and the foods associated with them, from around the world. "The book gives equal space to festivals like Diwali and Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year)," he smiles. The print run of the book is currently restricted to 12 copies and each copy is "engraved, hand bound and hand cut," he says, calling it a "labour of love". One copy will be auctioned off, with proceeds going to the Smile Foundation.Khanna calls the book a "once in a lifetime passion project".Explaining the auction and the book's limited copies, he says, "I hope the book will set a benchmark as the most expensive book in the world. I want to prove that you can make a mark with Indian cuisine, be it through cookbooks, dinners or TV." The book also features poetry by Khanna and covers regional celebrations like the Hornbill festival, held annually in Nagaland. A serendipitous meeting with a professor at Harvard, where Khanna had enrolled for a course in 2005, was the genesis of the book and most of his achievements, says Khanna. During the meeting, the professor opined that Indians weren't big spenders and that Khanna should go after a more "elevated market" which, according to him, included South America, Latin America, Persia, Spain and the Middle East. To prove his professor wrong, he worked hard to redefine Indian dining, says the chef, citing the example of the $39,000-a-plate dinner he hosted a couple of years ago. Did he ever predict such success for himself? Khanna looks incredulous. "Arey, pagal toh nahi hai tu?" he grins. Talking about future plans, Khanna admits to studying food trends that might come in handy in 2017-2018. He wants to decide the topic of his next book -grains, for instance he says, have been attracting a lot of interest."I'm only cooking till 2020. And then I'm just going to run my foundation, SAKIV," he smiles. - Aatish Nath</text>

	<text>Last year, we'd told you how couples were using IT students and amateur hackers to spy on each other. But of late, suspicious lovers seem to be taking things into their own hands, and technology is helping them in this endeavour. While apps that can clone WhatsApp and text conversations have been around for a few years now, they require physical access to the partner's phone. However, a new class of tools and applications has emerged to address a new way of cheating - dating apps. Many couples say that they fear that their partners might be using dating apps to meet other people, and to find out if that is the case, they use smartphone apps that can put their fears to rest (or confirm them). These tracking apps don't even need you to actually have your lover's phone - depending on whether they're paid or free, the apps can tell you if your partner uses dating apps, and when they last used them. The number of such tracking apps is only growing, and it appears there is no dearth of users in the capital. When an app is your private eye There are a number of free apps available on Android and iOS platforms to help users catch cheating partners. The basic premise of the apps is simple - most major dating apps use Google or Facebook logins, the information for which is in the public domain, and these tracking apps are able to find this information easily. Apps such as Couple Tracker , Catch a Cheating Lover etc tell you if a particular individual is using any major dating app or not. Paid apps will also tell you when the dating app was last used. A tracker to catch cheating boyfriends Brazilians were outraged when they learned their country was a top target of the US NSAs overseas spying operation, with data from billions of calls and emails swept up in Washingtons top secret surveillance programme. Since cheating in a relationship has become hi-tech, with dating apps, encrypted e-mails and texts, the tools to catch the cheaters need to change too, say suspicious lovers who've used these tracking apps. Abhilasha, a final-year medical student, says, "Most of the time, you already sort of know, but need proof. These apps give you that. I suspected that my boyfriend had been cheating on me, but it was only after I used one of these apps that I discovered that he was active on a popular dating app. When I confronted him, he admitted that he had been going on dates using the app for close to a year." Rakshit Anand*, a banking professional who downloaded these apps earlier this year, says, "I found out that my girlfriend had been using not one but three dating apps on her phone, even though we had been together for almost a year. Someone told me that it was wrong of me to go behind her back to try to get this information. But I say that if she has nothing to hide, then she won't be offended. One needs to be sure because cheating has become so easy with these dating apps and chat forums." Akshita*, an MBA student, says, "I downloaded the Couple Infidelity app just for fun. My friends had been checking on their boyfriends and I just wanted to prove how silly the entire exercise was. To my horror, I found that my boyfriend had a dating app in his phone. When I asked him about it, he tried to evade the question, but as I persisted, he admitted he used to meet girls through dating apps quite often. Naturally, I dumped him immediately." Paid apps for greater efficiency However, many doubting Thomases rue the free apps' lack of efficiency and have no qualms spending money for better apps and tools. Aniket, a DU student, says, "With the free apps that are available on Play Store , one can only ascertain if their partner downloaded a dating app or not, not whether they used it. That only gives you half the information." Aniket used Swipebuster, one of the most prominent paid services to spy on someone's dating app profile. The app tells you exactly when a particular individual last used their dating app and the location in which they used it as well. "Through the service, I found that not only was my then girlfriend using the app, she was using it to date multiple guys, whom she used to chat with regularly," he adds. Secret app to help in catching a cheating partner Cheaters, watch out! An Indian-origin entreprenuer has developed a 'cheat's app' that you can download on your partner's phone to create an invisible record of text messages and call logs from a suspected lover. An app like Swipebuster, which is available only on its site, costs $4.99 (about Rs 300), but users say it's worth the money. Rahul*, a marketing professional, says, "Usually, I don't pay for apps. Almost all the other apps in my phone are the ones you can download for free. But I downloaded this one because I was in a long-distance relationship and I had a feeling that my girlfriend was using dating apps to go on dates. I'd say spending Rs 300 beats living in doubt and torturing yourself. This way, I could confront her and dump her for cheating on me." Not always a good idea There are times, however, when your paranoia can do more harm than good. Akshay Tripathi*, a Noida-based IT professional, tells us, "I had a feeling that my ex-girlfriend was cheating on me and meeting other guys through dating apps , so I used Swipebuster to try and get details. As it turns out, she wasn't doing that. In fact, when she found out that I had tried to spy on her, she broke up with me!" (*Names changed on request)</text>

	<text>The demand for healthy diet snacks has gone up as people have become quite fitness conscious. But if you gorge on them mindlessly, even these healthy snacks can cause trouble in your weight loss plans. Nuts All Nuts are good news so eat your walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, cashew or pistachios raw or dry roasted. They are rich in fiber and protein, and help control blood glucose and lipids. However, they are loaded with calories, so grab a handful each time. Also avoid fried or packaged nuts as they are often heated in high temperatures using unhealthy fats that destroy the nutrients. Avocado Rich in lutein, fiber, vitamins B6, C and E, potassium, magnesium and folic acid, avocados have monounsaturated fats that help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and prevent heart disease. A medium Avocado has approximately 276 calories, so have just two-three slices at one sitting. Quinoa Quinoa is popular since it is the only whole grain with nine essential amino acids, making it a complete protein. It is also high in fibre and omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for the heart and controlling diabetes. But eat it in moderation as each cup of cooked Quinoa has 222 calories. Overeating it can also irritate your guts as it has saponin, the coating on quinoa. Hummus This dip, which is a healthy blend of chickpeas, sesame seeds, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice and spices, offers a good dose of protein, heart-healthy fats and fibre. But keep the serving limit to two tablespoons of Hummus as it has 50 to 80 calories. Instead of munching on chips with this dip, go for freshly cut vegetables which will benefit your weight loss efforts. Try making it at home, instead of buying it, since the market variety might contain high levels of sodium or syrup. Mango Mangoes are high in fibre and vitamins A, B6 and C, which help regulate blood glucose and digestion. It is also rich in copper, potassium and magnesium, minerals that promote cardiovascular health, but remember that one medium mango has 130 calories and 31 grams of sugar. So, balance your meals with less glycemic food and a low carbohydrate diet whenever you have mangoes. Try these tricks to avoid over-eating Avoid consuming multiple servings in one sitting Don't be greedy and stuff yourself Nibble on these food and keep a limit Carry them in a small tiffin and limit the portion size Always buy small-sized packs and avoid large ones Take servings in a small bowl, instead of eating from a container</text>

	<text>Four types of relationship patterns that indicate whether a couple is likely to stay together have been identified in a new study. The research, conducted by Brian Ogolsky of the University of Illinois, classified couples by the changes in their commitment to get married and the reasons for these changes. Ogolsky studied 376 unmarried couples in their mid-20s over the course of nine months. He identified four different relationship types: dramatic, conflict-ridden, socially involved and partner-focused. The dramatic group made up 34% of the couples who were more turbulent and spent less time together. The conflict-ridden formed 12%of the couples. They were the ones classified as having the most arguments, but the relationship was still sturdier than the dramatic couples. The third group, which accounted for 19% of couples, was the socially involved  heavily influenced by interactions with social networks. Partner-focused couples valued their partner above other aspects of life, but this could change depending on the amount of time spent together. These made up 30% of the group. The study also found that these "types also differed on important relational variables, including satisfaction, love, ambivalence, worries about marriage and leisure". The study found that, after the nine-month period, couples in the dramatic group, were most likely to break up. Those in the socially-involved group were said to be the most influenced by "interactions" on social networks, but their commitment to marriage varied the least. Those in the partner-focused group showed high levels of positive interaction and were deemed to have the highest chance of staying together and getting married.</text>

	<Heading>Glycemic Index - Calculations and Examples</Heading>

	<text>Glycemic index (GI) is a scale, which helps in ranking the carbohydrate rich foods, depending on how they affect blood glucose levels in a span of 2 - 3 hours after having food. The glycemic index of a carbohydrate-containing food is a ranking of how much it raises blood glucose level compared to pure glucose, which is assigned a glycemic index value of 100. The food having a higher GI breaks down quickly and shoots up your blood sugar levels rapidly. While the food having a lower GI takes a longer time to get digested and absorbed, resulting in slower and gradual changes in blood sugar levels. To determine a food's glycemic index value, researchers give 10 or more volunteers a portion of the food being tested that contains 50 grams of carbohydrate. The volunteers' blood glucose levels are checked before they eat the food and periodically during the two hours after they eat it. On another occasion, those same volunteers consume a portion of glucose (or sometimes white bread is used) that contains 50 grams of carbohydrate, and the same blood glucose measurements are taken. The two sets of measurements are then compared. Ten or more volunteers are used in these tests, and their results are averaged, because each person responds to food slightly differently. Not only does the glycemic index of a food vary slightly from person to person, but it also depends on whether the food is eaten in isolation or with other foods. Consuming a food along with protein, fat, or other carbohydrates that have a lower glycemic index effectively lowers its glycemic index value. Other things that can affect a food's glycemic index value include the ripeness of fruits (under-ripe fruits have a lower glycemic index than ripe fruit) and how foods are cooked or otherwise processed. A glycemic index value of 70 or higher is considered high, 56-69 is considered medium, and 55 or lower is considered low. A diet with low to medium glycemic index foods along with healthy protein is beneficial in diabetes. A helpful tip: Do not worry, there a simple way to get the Glycemic Index of commonly used foods Various web-based applications and GI calculators are available.

	<text>Are vegetarians more sensitive than others? This was a question that formed itself when I was watching a BBC Entertainment program in which four strangers living in the UK are persuaded to invite each other to their homes and cook and entertain each other for marks. That is at the end of each evening, they go back and assess each others entertaining skills based on how they have cooked and served the meal. "Phew! I can't stand the smell of cheese, could I go and sit in the living room?" asked the Indian Lady, a dance teacher, with a smile and a wiggle as she walked out of the dining room. Adding for good measure, " I think it's because I have a problem with something that is moldy," she explained why she had such a strong reaction to cheese. The others had a chance to complain when they tried her veggie thali meal, later on, particularly when she did not serve any wine to go with it. They did not however troop out of her dining room but remarked instead about how 'slimy' her milk and rice pudding had been. So what's kheer to the initiated is yucky nursery food to others. How important smells are, or should we say, aromas, comes through in the latest book on south Indian cuisine by Chandra Padmanabhan. She has not only re-packaged some of her earlier recipes in her new book, which is titled Southern Flavours, but she makes sure that you know how to enjoy a typical south Indian meal by the judicious combination of different elements. Talking of sambhars and curries she says for instance, "It is served hot with rice and a dollop of bubbling ghee, accompanied by a vegetable and friend and roasted papad on the side." One can just imagine the tingle of delight when the hot ghee is poured into a slight depression made in a mound of rice as it trickles onto the fresh green banana leaf underneath, with the scent of the stone ground herbs and chutneys by the side, the sour-sweet tang of pickles and the faint burnt flavor of the roasted pappad by the side. She creates a feast of tastes and textures and maybe that's what sets vegetarian cuisine from the south apart. Or as she writes again, "Souring agents are normally, tamarind, tomato, sour curd and lemon or lime juice. In order to make the perfect kuzhambu, we need to balance the flavours of the souring agent, salt and chilli." It's also interesting how different the cooking methods of the south Indian cook is from that of the north. No, it's not just a question of wheat being the staple of the north as compared to the rice of the south. It could be that rice required more liquid based curries, rasams and saarus, while the rotis and chapattis allow you to scoop up dry items easily. It would also seem however that the vegetarian delicacies of the North are textured to look and taste of more robust items. They also use different techniques such as baking, sealing in pots and allowing different flavours to emerge, or deep-frying. This is the season for instance when in Gujarat, people go into the fields and cook their 'Undhio' vessels sealed with all manner of ingredients from purple yams, tender flat beans, sweet potatoes, green bananas, brinjals etc., and cooked in a slow fire. Or that in Rajasthan the mornings start with freshly made jelabis and crisp besan fritters taken with hot milky chai. What makes the difference to Chandra's recipes is that she has innovated within the tradition. She jives with the times, telling you about her probiotic curd curry and sets the pace with oat uppuma, arbi patties (chepankizhangu vadai) and finger millet patties. Ouch, you want to ask her: your finger or mine? Southern Flavours  The Best of South Indian Cuisine by Chandra Padmanabhan, released by Westland, is priced at Rs. 599.</text>

	<text>What started as International Workers' Day in Chicago in May 1886 further spread to other parts of the world, India being no exception. The first celebration of Labour Day in India took place in Chennai on May 1, 1923. Organised by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan, the red flag, an emblem of the labour class, was also used in India. The party's leader, Singaravelu Chettiar, conducted 'May Day' celebrations in two places  one at a beach opposite Madras High court and the other at the Triplicane beach. He later presided over the meeting and a resolution declaring a holiday on the occasion was passed here. Certain other pointers explaining non-violent principles of the party, request for some financial aid and achieving independence for the workers of the world were discussed, too. A nationwide public holiday, it highlights the labour movements for communist and socialist political parties. Known by various names like Kamgar Din (Hindi), Kamgar Divas (Marathi) and Uzhaipalar Dinam (Tamil), the 'Antarrashtriya Shramik Diwas'. Russia Until the official declaration in 1917, Russians celebrated the day illegally. Post this year, these celebrations were boycotted by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, anarchists and Mensheviks. It went on to become a significant official holiday of the Soviet Union, which they celebrated with parades in major cities. Since 1992, it is officially termed as 'The Day of Spring and Labour' and is a major holiday. Japan In Japan, while there's no officially designated holiday on the day, most people take their day off since it falls between other national holidays. Starting from April 29, the 'Golden Week' begins. This day is celebrated as Showa Day, the birthday of Emperor Showa, who reigned between 1926 and 1989. May 3, 4 and 5 are celebrated as Constitution Memorial Day, Greenery Day and Children's Day, respectively. In New Zealand and some parts of Australia, this day is celebrated on the first Monday of October, while in US and Canada, it takes place on the first Monday of September Every year, a theme is planned by the members of the International Labour Day, this year being 'Celebrating the international labour movement'. This theme becomes the centre point of the celebrations and activities like crossword puzzle, anagram puzzle, word search puzzle, code cracker puzzle, word scramble puzzle take place.</text>

	<text>Chennai might not be talking Woodstock. But the spirit of the city is certainly rife with leitmotifs from the flower power generation. Whether it's the music played in the nightclubs or even the fashion statements made by the young and restless of the city. Women, as always seemed to leading the way with respect to the style quotient. And nowhere was this more prominent than at a recent do where a gang of girls walked in, dressed in what could only be termed as a floral bounty. Take the case of Isabelle and Arnelle. The duo have given a spin to the concept by wearing their outfits in two completely contrasting ways. You could try the same or some new combos. Add some beaded accessories, chunky jewellery and you're ready to give retro a new twist.</text>

	<text>Arun Ratna was part of several beauty pageants, including the Navy Queen, Queen of Malabar, Miss South India and Miss Hyderabad to name a few. Define fashion Fashion according to me is all about making your own style statement Choosing choreography over designing Though I did my course in fashion designing and won third prize at a designers' contest held at the national level, I soon felt that designing was not my cup of tea. I started doing choreography during my college days. That was the beginning. The challenges Being in Kerala, a virgin market in terms of fashion, I never found it hard to do fashion choreography. I am honoured to be the first choreographer from India to do Miss India International in Nepal, and seven to eight other countries by January 2012. Model matters A model is a medium that a company uses to promote its message or brand among the masses. While some may use a plus size model, others may prefer a lean one, all depending on the product that they are promoting. But otherwise, for pageants, what actually matters is your confidence and how diplomatic you are. If physical appearance is the concern, more than size, height matters. Kerala changing The models and the fashion scene in Kerala have changed a lot over the past five years. Today, the girls have their own signature style. With more beauty pageants being lined up, they have moulded themselves accordingly. So, we don't have to put in an extra effort while grooming them.</text>

	<text>You may have heard that diabetes causes eye problems and may lead to blindness. People with diabetes do have a higher risk of blindness than people without diabetes. But most people who have diabetes have nothing more than minor eye disorders. The incidence of such eye problems increases with duration of uncontrolled blood glucose levels. With regular check-ups, you can keep minor problems minor. And if you do develop a major problem, there are treatments that often work well if you begin them right away. If you have eye problems and diabetes, don't buy a new pair of glasses as soon as you notice you have blurred vision. It could just be a temporary eye problem that develops rapidly with diabetes and is caused by high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar in diabetes causes the lens of the eye to swell, which changes your ability to see. To correct this kind of eye problem, you need to get your blood sugar back into the target range (70-130 milligrams per deciliter or mg/dL before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL one to two hours after a meal). It may take as long as three months after your blood sugar is well controlled for your vision to fully get back to normal. Glaucoma Glaucoma occurs when pressure builds up in the eye. The pressure pinches the blood vessels that carry blood to the retina and optic nerve. Vision is gradually lost because the retina and nerve are damaged. People with diabetes are more likely to suffer from glaucoma than people without diabetes. The longer someone has had diabetes, the more common glaucoma is. Risk also increases with age. There are several treatments for glaucoma. Some use drugs to reduce pressure in the eye, while others involve surgery. Cataracts Many people without diabetes get cataracts, but people with diabetes are 60% more likely to develop this eye condition. People with diabetes also tend to get cataracts at a younger age and have them progress faster. With cataracts, the eye's clear lens clouds, blocking light. To help deal with mild cataracts, you may need to wear sunglasses more often and use glare-control lenses in your glasses. For cataracts that interfere greatly with vision, doctors usually remove the lens of the eye. Sometimes the patient gets a new transplanted lens. In people with diabetes, retinopathy can get worse after removal of the lens, and glaucoma may start to develop. Retinopathy The retina is a group of specialized cells that convert light as it enters though the lens into images. The eye nerve or optic nerve transmits visual information to the brain. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the vascular (blood-vessel related) complications related to diabetes which occurs due to damage to small vessels and is called a "microvascular complication." People who keep their blood sugar levels closer to normal are less likely to have retinopathy or to have milder forms. Your retina can be badly damaged before you notice any change in vision. For this reason, you should have your eyes examined regularly by an eye care professional. Questions to ask your doctor: How frequently should I get my eyes tested?

	<text>24/7, the all-day dining restaurant and coffee shop of Metropole Hotel is chic and cool at the same time. DECOR Located off the lobby of the Metropole, 24 X 7 has a casual coffee shop decor and atmosphere. The restaurant is brightened up by posters and wall paper. Though not very large, this coffee shop that seats 56 has made judicious use of space so it does not feel cramped. There is a buffet area along one of the walls and one corner holds the pastry counter. FOOD This restaurant has a good range of North Indian dishes, though it also has a selection of western, Chinese, Thai and South Indian. The house special starter is Chicken Lime Garlic, which is a blend of flavours, and from time to time they also offer the chef's specials like the Rava Fried Basa Fish which has successfully made the soft and mild tasting basa fish into a crispy and flavourful snack or the Mysore Cabbage Tikki which is also quite nice. The Murg Kasturi Kabab, Murg Seek Gilafi, Hariyali Paneer Tikka, Hariyali Seek Kebab and Aloo ki Nazakat (stuffed aloo) are also pretty good here. Those who like okra, may enjoy the Bhindi Karari. The Chinesestyle soups are also quite good. Being largely a coffee shop, their Chicken or Paneer Kathi Roll is one of their popular orders. For the mains, their specials are the Crispy Plum Glazed Chicken, Murg Kalamari, Fish in Green Masala and Bhuna Mushroom Paneer Babycorn.You can also ask for fusion specials of the chef - the Chicken Curriana which can be ordered off the menu comprises of chicken in a mild curry sauce with herbs and seasoning neatly plated with crunchy and well-presented sauteed vegetables, buttered rice, garlic bread and mashed potatoes on the side, a good one dish meal. They also have combo meals which are quite a filling solution if you have missed lunch or dinner, mainly popular dishes like Butter Chicken or Paneer Peshwari with Indian breads. If you are looking for comfort foods they also offer dishes like Dal Khichdi. Among desserts, they offer Indian sweets like seasonal halwas and Gulab Jamun. PLUS AND MINUS 247 is a good place to drop in for a quick and casual combo meal, a one dish meal or just starters, with teas or coffees.</text>

	<text>It's been seen in a host of films like 'Alice in Wonderland', the 'Twilight' series and the 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', and is huge style craze off the screen, too. The late singer Amy Winehouse was a huge fan of goth dressing. Kim Kardashian West and Katy Perry are known to don goth-inspired all-black outfits and Taylor Swift also turned heads when she ditched her usual avatar for a 'future-goth' ensemble at this year's Met Gala. More recently at the Cannes Festival, Sonam Kapoor channelled the style in her sheer ruffled black dress. It's not just fashion, the genre has also spawned a variety of cultural fests across the globe. What started as a post-punk movement in the 1970s seems to have transitioned into a luxurious-yet-edgy style. On World Goth Day tomorrow, here's why the dark and sexy vibe is one of the biggest influences, today... Hot on the runway and red carpet The trend is anything but submissive and plays up on sensuality. Goth is a huge trend all over fashion runways in New York, Paris and London. The trend was huge in 2015 Fall-Winter collections with leather jackets, fishnet skirts, ruffle lace gowns, and strapless dresses. This style can largely be divided into two sub-genres  romantic, with tailored waist jackets, lace shirts and corsets, and steampunk  with spiked collars and bracelets, bondage pants and dresses and latex pants. Heard of 'health goth'? This kickstarted when three pals posted their pics online in fitness outfits, like a hoodie floating in a transparent cube. This became a huge trend. The hashtag #healthgoth saw fit-savvy folk showing off gym wear a la mesh T-shirts and neon, glow-in-the-dark styles. It's about futurism and aesthetics. Get ready for punk-pilates! When makeup goes macabre Blood red maroons have pushed out basic red when it comes to lip colours. The foreboding look  a hot fad from 2014  continues to dominate makeup this year. Think dark browns, purple and even jet black. Not only on the runways, celebrities at this year's biggest events showed it off. Watch out though, the dramatic hue is a tad intimidating so keep it out of the workplace. Haircuts with undercut sides, blunt micro bangs and sharp short bobs also fit into the look. Accessories Go for chunky metal chains, as well as skulls and skeletons in pendants and bracelets. Also opt for armbands and black ribbons with chokers around the neck and silver Victorian rings. Wear black corset heels to complete the look. Tattoos and piercings From neck tattoos to face tats, goth insignia has inspired a whole sub-culture of morbid body art. Popular designs include skull-crossbones, pirate, demon skulls as well as calligraphy lettering. Books Modern vampire novels focus on intimacy, decay and the supernatural. Novels set in the Victorian period with eerie marsh settings and castles are also a part of this genre. TIPS TO WEAR THE LOOK 1) Team strappy boots or gladiators with your leather skirt or shorts. 2) Corsets are a big part of the wardrobe. 3) Hair can be worn deep black with streaks of silver, red or even deep purple. 4) During the Victorian time, ringlets were popular so separate your hair into sections using a curling iron and spray, for a cool variation. 5) Try long bangs that cover one eye or go with them on one side. 6) Stay away from blush  goths do not add any colour to their cheeks. 7) For a high-impact look, try a simple a slick-back ponytail with minimal cheek powder, and go for deep kohl-lined eyes and a dark maroon matte lipstick.</text>

	<text>The BJP government has begun work on a major overhaul of the Medical Council of India as it looks to create more medical colleges and produce more doctors to cater to growing healthcare needs. Sources said during a review meeting of the health sector, PM Narendra Modi and the health ministry had also discussed the option of scrapping the country's apex medical education regulator, which has been shrouded in controversy in recent years. Although sources ruled out such a drastic measure, the government has set up a three-member panel to prepare a blueprint to revamp the current set-up. The highpowered committee has Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya, the PM's additional principal secretary P K Mishra and Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant as members.Sources said that at the meeting it was pointed out that the MCI is one of the major stumbling blocks towards a faster expansion, especi ally when it comes to ensuring quality education. The development came after the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare too had called for a complete overhaul of the medical council as it has repeatedly failed in its mandate as a regulator of medical education and profession. In its report before Parliament last month, the panel had recommended that the Act under which the council was established be scrapped and new legislation be brought in Parliament "at the earliest". Sources said that at the PM's meeting, the need for major focus on increasing the availability of doctors and paramedical staff, especially in poor-performing sta es such as Bihar, UP , Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, was emphasised. At the same time, the government is acutely aware that drastic action through legislative amendments may not be easy given hat changes must be ushered in via he legislative route and the government does not enjoy majority in Rajya Sabha. In recent years, MCI has been involved in controversies, the panel pointed out and it was shocked to know that compromised individuals had made it to the medical council, but the health and family welfare ministry is not empowered to act. It noted that the MCI chief admitted o "corruption when there was sanctioning of medical colleges, or increasing or decreasing seats" and "private medical colleges arrange ghost faculty and patients during inspections by MCI and no action is taken for the irregularity".</text>

	<text>The holiday season is long gone and you've probably started to regret the food comas and binge drinking, and have pledged to get to the gym. But with orthoexia nervosa - the obsession with healthy eating and fitness - hitting headlines, how can you adopt a truly healthy lifestyle without becoming obsessed? In the last four months of 2015, I tried to find out with the help of a fitness expert and celebrity personal trainer who revealed the most important ways to find the right balance for your body. I learned that the key to a healthy lifestyle is staying motivated without getting hooked on fitness routines and strict diets. London-based personal trainer and founder of the Be The Fittest service, Tyrone Brennand, warns me against the risks of falling for so-called "Hollywood health trends" and desiring to copy unrealistic bodies seen on magazines and social media. "Becoming too obsessed with training and dieting can become detrimental for your health. I mean, it's important to remember that we all should exercise regularly and eat healthy to have a fit, healthy body and mind, to also feel good, but once we start becoming obsessed this can be a trigger to an adverse effect," he says. He explains that getting hooked on being healthy might trigger addiction to performance enhancing supplements, hormones, unhealthy diets and cause eating disorders. The routines and diets you see online and on magazines might simply not be for you. During my training sessions with Brennant, I begin to understand that it's all about finding the right balance, resting and recovering, and "listening to your body". "Everyone has a routine that will suit them best but I think the right way of doing it is all about balance," he explains. "There are different sessions, intensities and volumes." But on top of not abusing your body with workouts, it is important to stay balanced with what you eat. "I think many people follow certain diets trying to achieve certain results but they do not know what their body needs or lacks and how it reacts to specific foods," he says. "Make sure your diet is clean, balanced and healthy by avoiding processed foods. It's all about eating what your body requires day to day and understanding how your body reacts to certain foods. You can treat yourself sometimes, too. So eat the healthier types of foods in restaurants. Also eat in moderation - don't over fill yourself. "Try and add good fruits and vegetables into your diet, making sure your diet is balanced so also having fibre and giving your body all the nutrients it needs. So, combining exercises with a good diet is the formula for fitness - but what's the best way of getting back to training in the New Year? "Listen to your body if you need a rest, and so rest your body. You are the best person who understands your body and what it needs," says Brennant. "I think training from three to five days a week is enough to keep a healthy lifestyle. Whether you exercise for 20 minutes or an hour. If someone does train up to five days a week or more they must remember to keep it balanced with the type of training, volume and intensity to keep from over reaching and being at risk of injury." He also recommends practising yoga inbetween training sessions. "The gains and feeling I have got from yoga have been unbelievable, and have also helped me improve my other aspects of training." All this sounds good in writing, of course, but putting it into pratice can be a bit challenging at the beginning, so if you're sweating already at the idea, I hear you. But, once you get the flow and realise what you can achieve, you will feel stronger, healthier and balanced: you will feel good. And that's where personal training comes into action: with motivation and guidance while you're exercising. "Energy", "no pain, no gain"... you've heard them all, but it really means something when you're breaking the sweat, your heart is beating so fast that you feel you're about to faint and you can barely catch your breath. Brennant motivated me with these words during his hour-long sessions - despite the phrases sounding cliched, they kept me going strong. He just wouldn't let me slack off. But every drop sweat was worth it. I challenged myself in different routines, from circuits to boxing. In four months of training I realised I was capable of doing so much more than I thought. It's all about that feeling rather than trying to copy unrealistic, ripped bodies. So, now we're all motivated, right. It's January after all. "New year, new you..." But how to keep yourself motivated thoughout the year? "Instead of just trying to get fit for January, try and set yourself a two or three month goal at first," Brenant advises. "Then set small target markers to reach and aim for per month or fought night, so you can see progression and keep on track but still have an end goal to aim for. "Once you have reached the three month period and successfully completed that challenge then set anothertwo or three month goal and follow same process. If you fail within this time then perhaps set smaller marker goals like every week for a month or so."</text>

	<text>Title: Real Resonance, the Unreal Mind Author: Chandra Shekhar Dubey Publisher: Shambhai, The Third Eye Imprint Price: INR 150 Dr Chandra Shekhar Dubey's "Real Resonance, the Unreal Mind" is a collection of poems woven around life's miscellaneous nuances, ranging from love, spirituality, gender issues, social causes and nature. Dr Dubey who is an Associate Professor of English Literature at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College is a master of abstract and romanticism and reminds you of John Donne and P.B Shelley when you go through his collection of poems. But you can't allocate a particular style to the author as he follows a new one in every poem. This beautiful technique of surprising the reader continues in all his works. If Dr Dubey's earlier poetic works, "Ripples on a stone" and "Substance of Shadows" explored the mysterious world of human psyche with their profound analysis of abstract, polysemous sentiments, Real Resonance is experience and sensibility amalgamated into a harmonious blend, shaped into esthetic, pulchritudinous verses. The verses give away a poet who is an adroit scholar and knows the Roman mythology, the English countryside and the British mannerisms like the back of his hand and yet, he infuses them all with a deep, tender Indian spirit. Time fritters with silent footfalls...the author's imagery is superb and he is is able to invoke a different image in all his poems. Dr Dubey's romanticism is almost infectious. The compelling emotion of his poems, force you out of the tedious hustle and bustle of your own life and lead you to a tranquil world where feelings, emotions and inspirations, still make a difference. "Real Resonance, The Unreal Mind" is truly the resonance of a mind that's supremely unusual in the way it looks at life and churns various realizations and experiences into a dazzling string of words, lending posterity to life's unforgettable moments in the annals of time.</text>

	<text>After a tough workout session, muscle soreness often sets in. But when your training escalates to the point that you're having a bromance with good old DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), you may need to find some alternative reliefand, you know, dial your workouts back a bit! Restrictive clothing It may sound a tad bit fantastic and even looney, but workout recovery can be aided by clothing that corrects your posture. So, shirts and shorts, which have built-in elasticised bands can subtly coax the body into better postural alignment. These bands target specific muscle groups and connect one to another. This way, muscles which are underused in areas like the chest and the back, are simulated. According to physical fitness enthusiasts, the body feels best when the joints are in neutral alignment which is the foundation of physical therapy and recovery. The back, which is one of the main muscle groups that gets stressed during a workout needs to be aligned to heal correctly. Experts say that it is not about compressing or restricting the muscles but encouraging them to heal in a healthier and more natural movement pattern. Cyrotherapy In cyrotherapy, you spend two to three minutes with your body enclosed in a chamber that circulates extremely chilled air. It works on the principle that when exposed to severe cold, the body sends the blood to the core to protect vital organs. Once back to normal temperature, the body immediately rushes the blood to peripheral tissues. This way, blood flow is improved considerably which results in reduced inflammation, pain and an increased metabolic rate including an endorphin rush. Proteins Amino acids are the building blocks of tissue, and we consume protein to give our bodies enough to rebuild and maintain muscles damaged during workouts. Having a little protein before working out can trigger our bodies to start muscle synthesis (repairing and building more muscle) throughout and even after hitting the weights. While a protein-rich snack can get the body ready for a great workout, sipping on a protein smoothie or eating a protein-filled meal can ensure the body has enough fuel to keep on rebuilding throughout the day. Also, Consuming a light, protein-rich snack before bed allows our bodies to keep repairing muscles overnight.</text>

	<text>Although it may sound counterintuitive, researchers from the University of Adelaide say that the global increase in Type-1 diabetes is directly linked to advances in medical care that has significantly increased the life expectancy of people. For the study, the researchers looked at the prevalence of Type-1 diabetes in 118 countries and changes in life expectancy from 1950 to 2010. After applying a measure known as the Biological State Index to the data, they found that the rapid increase in Type-1 diabetes over the last few decades was directly linked with increases in human life expectancy, especially in Western countries. "Up to the early 20th century, Type-1 diabetes was a horrible and dangerous disease, usually leading to people's death during their teens or early 20s," said lead study author Wenpeng You. "This meant there was limited opportunity for people with the disease to have children and to pass their genetic material onto future generations. In evolutionary terms, this is what we call 'natural selection'," he explained. However, with the widespread introduction of insulin from the 1920s onwards, and improvements in modern medicine, life expectancy for people with Type- diabetes has now increased to about 69 years. "That is a remarkable achievement, but it also means that with reduced natural selection, the genetic material leading to the development of type-1 diabetes may be accumulating at a rapid rate within the world's population," You noted. The findings were published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research &amp; Care. The researchers decided to investigate the link because although cases of Type-1 diabetes have been increasing globally, its prevalence is uneven in different parts of the world. "Not every country has access to good health care, or freely available insulin. In a number of poor countries, such as in Africa, the life expectancy for people with Type-1 diabetes is much lower than in the Western world. This means more people are dying prematurely, with less opportunity to produce offspring who will carry those genes from generation to generation," You said.</text>

	<text>An innovative experiment of raising charity funds through screening feature films in cinema halls seems to have come as a big relief for nine cancer-afflicted girls in Karnataka who are now looking forward to regular fund flows for uninterrupted treatment. Sreeraksha, Prajna, Amisha, Nafisathula Ifrath, Devapriya, Nidhi Kamat, Mariyam Saheera, Apeksha and Fathimath Misbha, undergoing treatment at the Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Mangalore, require monetary support - ranging from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.3 lakhs ($1,500-$4,500) - for cancer treatment. NGO CanKids Kidscan has joined hands with producers of Kannada film "The Plan" to raise awareness and funds for its Girl Child Project that offers treatment and support to girls with cancer. The funds collected by the NGO, along with the film's producers - Malgudi Talkies and Day Dream Creations - will support the nine girls in Mangalore by offering treatment, emotional and psychological support, transportation, nutrition, education, accommodation and social reintegration. For a daily wage labourer who is the father of nine-year-old Fathimath Misbha, diagnosed with Acute Lymphblastic Leukemia, the funds would be a blessing for his child. "We don't have money. If they don't help, we would stop the treatment," said Fathimath's father. The NGO and the film's producers are aiming to collect Rs.12 lakh through crowd funding for the nine girls through advance sale of tickets of a special re-release of the movie in Mangalore, Udupi, Karkala and Kundapur on April 22. The producers were about to release a free digital version of the movie on YouTube when a call for a donation from an acquaintance for the cancer treatment of a school girl threw up the idea of generating funds for charity through film screenings. The Mumbai-based Malgudi Talkies' chief Ashok Shetty said: "My friends suggested that rather than releasing a free version of the film on YouTube, we could re-release it on select screens and collect charity funds through advance sale of tickets." He said donors can contribute and save a girl's life and get free tickets of "The Plan" by visiting http://malguditalkies.in/shop/ The popular film, featuring Ananth Nag, Kousthubh Jayakumar, Hemanth, Sriram, Gauthami and Harish Roy, was first released in November. "We are going to colleges and cities to highlight the cause linked to the re-release of the film. We are aiming to collect Rs 12 lakh for the nine cancer bravehearts," Shetty said. "For every ticket that is sold, Rs.60 would be directed towards the treatment of the nine girls," said Shetty. Film director Keerthi said if the experiment for the cause is successful, they may continue to re-release the movie in other parts of the state too. All the nine girls undergoing treatment at KMC Hospital, Mangalore, are under the care of Dr. Harsha Prasad L, assistant professor in the department of paediatrics. "A majority of childhood cancers are curable. It is a crime not to seek medical help for a girl child with cancer," Prasad maintained. "The Girl Child Project campaign will help create awareness about the importance of treating girls similar to boys," he added. CanKids KidsCan chairman Poonam Bagai said: "Such a crowd funding initiative has been attempted first time by us in partnership with Malgudi Talkies and Day Dream Creations." "Gender discrimination in our country is prevalent at all levels. In a study in Haryana in 2013, we found that girls with cancer seem to be facing discrimination as compared to boys," she said. "Some parents do not want to inform relatives or neighbors about this ailment as it could hamper the marriage prospect of their other children," she said. The CanKids Girl Child project aims to strengthen and empower girl patients and survivors to become leaders and ambassador of childhood cancer, she said. CanKids Kidscan is a non-profit organization for childhood Cancer in India. It works on all aspects to bring a change in childhood cancer from support services to awareness, advocacy, stakeholder engagement, capacity building, quality care, research and impact. Cancer kills as many as 264 children per week in the country. As many as 13,726 deaths due to childhood cancer occurred in India in 2010, of which is 0.7 percent of deaths were among those aged one month to 14 years.</text>

	<text>At the second edition of the recently concluded Ice Cream Festival in the capital, there weren't just kulfis and ice creams, but also a variety of ice-cream-based desserts. Visitors told us that for those people who'd never tried an ice cream sandwich or ice cream roll, this fest was a must-visit. Desi-videshi combos Delhi's finest `ice-creamers' showcased a variety of ice creams, which included not only water-based ice cream, but also mirch kulfis, ice cream rolls and, of course, some international flavours. Ice cream lovers participated in competitions like speed blind tasting and the no-hands challenge. When we spoke to ice-creamers, they told us the flavour that was most in de mand was Belgian choco late. "Most people don't visit ice cream festivals because they don't know such events are taking place. People just happen to be in the area and they go for it. But once you have been there, you will always go back," Salma Khan, one of the visitors on the first day of the fest, said. Sugar-free sweets not in demand Dilip Singh, a staff member at one of the stalls, said, "We have fatfree and sugar-free ice cream, but these are the least popular types of ice cream. Ice cream lovers don't even look at them and weight-watchers try them once in a while. We still keep the option available, just in case someone wants it." "Most people prefer whipped cream, extra chocolate sauce and chocolate cookies," says Radhika Gupta, a home chef who prepares desserts with ice cream. She adds, "Chocolate, both dark and white, and ice cream are a treat for any chocolate lover. I use whipped cream and fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce while preparing the dish, and to decorate it too." Delhi likes it desi One of the most crowded outlets of the fest was the `India Gate ka chuski' stall, which, we were told, was the one that sells the most at the fest each year.At India Gate, vendors use their hands to grate the ice, but here, they used hands-free portable ice-graters. Which toppings do people want the most? Chocolate cookies, whipped cream and chocolate sauce were the most preferred toppings Not just ice creams The event wasn't just limited to different flavours of ice cream, but also offered a variety of ice-creambased desserts such as ice cream cakes Desi sweets rule the festival? Kulfis came in all flavours - some conventional, and others that were more unusual, such as the mirch kulfi Which dessert raked in the moolah? Chuskis are the biggest money-makers at the fest each year. The vendors use grating machines to crush the ice Step by step Some desserts drew crowds not just for their taste, but also for their intriguing preparation process, like the ice cream roll</text>

	<text>Whether you're a fan of the modern-day Sherlock Holmes portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, his across the-pond counterpart Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Downey Jr in the Guy Ritchie films, Jeremy Brett, who many consider the definitive incarnation of the fictional detective, or prefer the short stories and novels -today is a day that's bound to warm the cockles of your heart. It's Sherlock Holmes Day , which means it's the perfect occasion to celebrate the world's most famous sleuth. So how do you go about doing it? Here are a few ideas... Binge watch This is the most convenient thing to do on a Sunday. Round up a bunch of your Sherlock-loving pals and bingewatch episodes of Sherlock or Elementary. If you're in the mood to watch movies, then try the RDJ flicks or the more recent Mr Holmes, which would be a bonus for X-Men and Lord of the Rings fans, since it stars Ian McKellan. If you're a bit old-school, you could source episodes from the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Jeremy Brett. Host a quiz evening Do you have a group of friends who are die-hard Sherlock Holmes fans? Then organise a quiz evening during which your buddies can compete to show off who knows the most about the detective. The quiz could be about Sherlock in general, or could be more specific -like about the short stories, or any of the current popular TV shows. And if you're participating in the quiz, you may want to bring your A Game. Have a Sherlock-themed party If you're super-enthusiastic about the day, then go into full-on Sherlock Holmes mode and organise a themed party . Send out invitations (e-mail or even SMS is acceptable), get fun decor and incorporate other elements that we've mentioned, like a quiz or binge-watching session. You could even organise a sleuthing competition, complete with a crime and clues for your guests. Sherlock Holmes decor ideas Pay tribute to the fact that Sherlock Holmes is a chemistry fiend and use beakers as glasses Change your door number to 221B Get printouts of Sherlock quotes and hang them up. Stick toothpicks that have Sherlock references on them into finger foods. Organise a reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote 60 short stories based on Sherlock Holmes. So this day would be perfect to re-read them, or introduce yourself or your friends to them. Get a copy of one of these stories and organise a reading. You could even get people to read a short story beforehand, and then get them together to watch an episode of The Adventures Sherlock Holmes based on the story. Popular Sherlock Portrayers - Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock - Robert Downey Jr in the Sherlock Holmes movies (2009 and 2011) - Jonny Lee Miller in Elementary - Jeremy Brett in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes - Basil Rathbone in the Sherlock Holmes film (1939-1946)</text>

	<text>Actress Dakota Johnson appeared with a new look in her new tousled bob-length locks. The actress, best known as Anastasia Steele in "Fifty Shades of Grey", was spotted hanging out here wearing her newly lobbed hair on Wednesday. Teaming her new hairdo with skinny jeans, grey coat, boots and round glasses, the 25-year-old actress looked more fresh, reports aceshowbiz.com. The bob cut suits her so much as it frames her face nicely. Johnson appeared in "Fifty Shades of Grey" with her long brunette hair. In the movie, she used to style her hair into a braid which definitely matched the character's innocent disposition. "Fifty Shades of Grey" was based on erotic romance novel written by E. L. James under the same title. Directed by Sam Taylor-Jonson with a screenplay by Kelly Marcet, the movie also starred Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Eloise Mumford as Katherine Kavanagh.</text>

	<text>Title: Indian Family Business Mantras; Authors: Peter Leach and Tatwamasi Dixit; Publisher: Rupa; Pages: 252; Price: Rs.595 True to its title, the book summarises the spirit of Indian family businesses. It has not only captured the positive side of family-run business but also highlighted the various challenges faced by such companies. The book, written by family business expert and a partner at Deloitte UK, Peter Leach, and Tatwamasi Dixit, Vedic scholar and family business consultant, clearly indicates the traits of family businesses in India. It speaks about how family business helps to easily identify the talent in the top management as these people are mostly family members themselves. On the other hand, the book highlights how members often get complacent and businesses nosedive. The authors have also highlighted how disputes between siblings lead to destruction of family businesses. Once a dispute arises, the focus of energy is on resolving it rather than on the business. It says flexibility in thinking and the spirit of give and take are essential in resolving disputes, rather than becoming involved in indirect communications which can deepen misunderstandings, resulting in disputes leading to destruction. It has analyses of some of the top Indian business families including Tata Group, Biocon, Ranbaxy, Murugappa Group, GMR Group, Termax and Godrej among others. The book compared how the Western world has in the last five centuries witnessed tremendous wealth creation, and family businesses have thrived. Good family governance is fundamental to foster good corporate governance, it explains. While globalisation has brought new perspectives to the Indian system, human values and family traditions remain at the fulcrum of family businesses in India. "Family enterprise has been one of the most prevalent and resilient business forms over centuries and across continents. It represents a cornerstone of the world economy and, according to some estimates, family-managed businesses generate well over half the world's GDP," the book says. There are many family businesses worldwide but Indian family businesses are unique and have their own governing characteristics. They showcase a distinct, ingrained value system that includes the socio-political concepts of Sama, Dana, Bheda and Danda - Hindu philosophy's four approaches to human interaction, it says. But the book also said Indian family businesses are in difficult times as many family businesses with aging patriarchs are having to face up to pressing decisions about what should happen next. Many next-generation family members are attending universities and business schools in Europe, Britain and the United States, and are returning home to experience a severe disconnect between what they have learned and family business practices in India. Successful family businesses tend to be stable structures. They are often durable, low-profile, profitable and niche enterprises that shun publicity. Commitment and a stable culture lie behind the fact that family businesses are generally very solid and reliable structures - and are perceived as such in the marketplace. It says Indian family businesses have traditionally been dominated by men and although this is beginning to change, progress is slow and tentative, with gender issues continuing to cause significant tensions and inefficiencies in India's family-owned companies.</text>

	<text>Wear hair in braids and avoid frequent hair wash to maintain your hair during summer time, says an expert. Nirmal Randhava, make-up artist and owner of Indica Makeover, has shared essential tips for hair care during summer time. Wear hair in braids A messy braid can be ideal for keeping your hair under control, the summer heat and humidity calls for some gentle hair do. This will reduce the exposure area under the scorching sunlight. Cover up Another great summer hair care tip is when you are out in the sun, opt for a hat or a scarf. Not only will they protect your hair from ultra-violet rays, but will also help hair retain moisture. These accessories will enhance your fashion style and will also keep your hair protected. Avoid frequent hair wash Washing your hair frequently will trigger more oil production thus making you feel the need to wash your hair more often. Try rinsing in the shower just to get rid of excess oil in the hair. A quick fix is to dab a cotton ball soaked in witch hazel along your scalp to dissolve excess oil. Damp your hair before swimming Using clean water after a dip will help your hair absorb less salt water or chemicals from the pool. In addition to that, always take a shower after taking a dip or spray your hair with clean water to get rid of hard water of the pool. Use a wide-tooth comb instead of a brush Wide-tooth combs are most gentle for untangling hair, as brushes can pull and tear when they snag strands. Avoid pulling anything through your hair when it's wet. Massage the scalp with hot oil Coconut, olive, and avocado oils are good at penetrating the hair shaft. Massage with oil and then work using oil from ends to roots, rinse then condition as usual. Your hair should feel moisturized afterward, but not greasy.</text>

	<text>Monogomy has long been the most popular way to conduct a sexual relationship, yet some anthropologists think that polygamy has actually been the norm through human history. This may explain why as a society, we often aspire to be monogamous, putting fidelity on a pedestal, but then aren't always that good at it in practice. For some couples, giving their partner permission to act out their sexual desires with other people feels like a more honest and realistic option. Many couples also report that open relationships bring them closer together. This is backed up by a 2014 study published in the 'Sexual and Relationship Therapy' journal which concluded that older adults in open relationships reported being happier, healthier, and more sexually active than the general population of similar age and relationship status. Could you and your partner be one of these couples? It's certainly not for everyone and if you are tempted to carry it through, it's a good idea to consider what it might mean for you. The ideal relationship: Having an open relationship usually means that each partner is free to engage with other people sexually and emotionally but it's really an umbrella term and non-monogomy can come in many different forms. Maybe you don't want to actively seek diversions elsewhere but would like an agreement that if either of you wanted, you could embark on the odd liaison free of guilt. This might come under the label of 'monogomish', coined by the US love and sex advice columnist, Dan Savage. Emotional fallout: For some people who do end up entering into an open relationship, even though there's an understanding between partners that the primary relationship still stands, the hurt that's experienced when your other half actually carries the fantasy through is overwhelming. So, unless both of you share the same thinking, the bottom line is that open relationships do sometimes cause a great deal of pain. Importance of boundaries: Why are some couples able to make open relationships work? They know exactly where the other is coming from. Whether it's casual sex or more intimate relationships, neither feels abandoned. They share exactly the same agenda and intend to return to their life once it's over. A risk worth taking? If tempted, make sure both of you are on the same page. Secondly, if you've agreed on some basics with a partner, don't assume they'll last forever. As with most other things, regular checking in to see how the other is doing is important. Keeping communication open will let you both know where you stand. Finally, don't be afraid to admit that what you thought you wanted hasn't proved as exciting as you'd hoped. You may also find that although the arrangement didn't work for you, your partner thinks otherwise. Ultimately, you might think this is a risk worth taking  only you and your partner can decide that.</text>

	<text>Three experts tell us how they approach diabetes and offer remedial measures. Dr. Narendra Bhatt, Ayurvedic doctor Ayurvedic texts have described `Madhumeha', which is similar to diabetes as one of the 20 forms of dysuria. While Madhumeha falls under, vaat -the cosmic phenomenon is functionally represented in human body in terms of vaat (air), pitta(fire) and kapha(earth) -category of dysuria, the role of agni, the metabolic factor and disturbances of urinary and sweat channels, are of great significance too. One of the greatest strengths of ayurveda is in identifying possible causative factors that relate to clinical manifestation, excessive urinary flow is one such. Careful study of lifestyle can help identify the cause for the illness in an individual. Diet, not only in terms of the quality of food, but when and in what manner you eat are equally important. Irregular timings of food intake or eating dinner continuously late are definite invitation to this illness. Sedentary lifestyle, particularly working on computers and use of air-conditioners, are other contributing factors, as these lead to controlled metabolic circulation against natural processes, which must be in sync with the environment. Those who travel frequently by air or in airconditioned cars -if not balanced with physical activities -are susceptible to early onset of this disease. Ayurveda also acknowledges that diabetes is a genetically predisposed disease and can be tackled by following a proper diet. The best solution I could offer is to exercise and to go for regular walks. There is no substitute to walking for prevention or management of diabetes. Abhishek Sharma, Yoga teacher Diabetes is acknowledged as a lifestyle disease. It's the disorder of the metabolic system. Yoga offers prevention, helps in the management of diabetes and in some cases even cures it. This is because yoga offers a holistic regime. It creates a balance in the body. It works on the system as a whole, and brings equilibrium in the body.Yoga works on balancing the nervous system, endocrine system, and helps the coordination between different systems in the body. While yoga in totality is helpful for diabetics, there are some asanas and pranayam that are specifically beneficial. Ardha matsyendra, which essentially is a spinal twist, is very effective for one. The posture compresses pancreas, kidneys and stimulates digestion and squeezes out toxins. It rejuvenates the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Urdhva-mukh Svanasanis another powerful pose that awakens upper-body strength and offers a wonderful stretch for the chest and abdomen. Be cause you're holding the stretch in the abdomen region, you are increasing the blood circulation in the area and the effect it has on digestive system is great. This, if practised along with SHASHANKASANA -performed by lowering your body and placing your head on floor -in rhythm, is extremely beneficial. It improves the function of the pancreas, kidney and intestine. Surya Namaskar, a series of 12 asanas performed in a dynamic manner -increases the blood circulation in the entire system.It tones the spine and stomach, and helps in the coordination of the different systems in the body, which helps in diabetes. It rejuvenates the entire body. Anulom vilom - or alternate nostril breathing exercise -is one of the main practices of pranayama.The entire nervous system and the endocrine system creates an equilibrium in the system and regulates the secretion of different glands in the body. It also helps to calm the nerves and reduce stress, which also is a big factor in diabetes. Kapalbhati (refer to the process below) is a breathing technique that directly stimulates the pancreas. It also helps the body get rid of toxins and increases the metabolic rate.D Elongate your spine upwards, lengthen your neck and bring your chin back. Relax your stomach muscles. D Now expel the air as forcefully as you are comfortable with through the nose. This should cause the abdominal muscles to con tract and should draw the abdomen inwards towards the spine (like when you suck in your stomach). Then allow the inhalation to occur passively. To repeat, the exhalation is done using conscious force, while the inhalation is just a recoil action bringing the air back into the lungs. All the breathing takes place through the nose. Right after the pas sive inhalation, exhale again forcefully and continue at a steady rhythm. Dr.Manish Motwani , Bariatric surgeon Obesity is a complex, clinical disorder. Studies have proven that there are many detrimental health effects of obesity with an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, gall bladder disease, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic musculoskeletal problems, polycystic ovary syndrome, infertility, psychosocial problem as well as some forms of cancer. Bariatrics is the field of medicine that specialises in treating obesity.Bariatric surgical procedures bring about major weight loss for people with morbid obesity. But let me point out, weight loss surgery is not only for obese people, but also for those who are unable to shed weight through dieting or other hormonal problems. What weight loss surgery does is it causes pro found changes in the incretions -hormones in the gastrointestinal tract that cause insulin to be released. Another reason for control of diabetes after laparoscopic weight loss surgery is significant weight loss and reduced dietary intake. These changes lead to significant improvement in Type 2 diabetes and can cause long-term changes in the pancreas that causes diabetes to go away. These changes help individuals: Get remission for Type 2 diabetes Decrease the amount of medications they need on a daily basis Postpone the onset of diabetes (especially for individuals with pre-diabetes). Obesity is a grave disease and root cause of various medical problems. The best treatment for obesity is prevention. So, healthy lifestyle choices would ensure long-term fitness. Bariatric surgery, also called metabolic surgery is a safe and proven option for morbid obesity and diabetes and the only method in the world giving a cue rate of more than 75-80 per cent. A word of caution- A patient, especially if he/she suffers from diabetes, must take preventive measures after a bariatric surgery. Various preventive measures that must be adopted post bariatric surgery are: Close follow-up postoperatively is needed because of the high risk of hypoglycaemia. No self-medication or self-reduction of medicines. These should be supervised by endocrinologists.Regular follow up meetings with a nutritionist. Diet post-surgery should be systematic and supervised.</text>

	<text>Designer Wendell Rodricks has started work on turning his home into a museum of Goan sartorial traditions Fashion designer Wendell Rodricks is alarmingly unattached to his magically begotten and lovingly dressed heritage home in the village of Colvale in Goa. The bungalow is in the process of being converted into a museum of Goan costume. "I feel no remorse," he says. "It's a place with such happy energies. I want to give it back to Goa; it will be my contribution to Colvale." This is his ancestral village; of which the Rodricks are 'gaonkars' -the first people who settled and started a village. "If I dig deep enough in the church records, I can find my family's Hindu names before they converted," he says. "Living in my village truly gives me a sense of connect. From my people, I learn the native wisdom I have lost -like you have to warm up mango blossoms in winters so that you can have fruit in the winters." Rodricks is sitting in the veranda that extends at the back of his house. This is the centre of his family life with partner Jerome Marrel, their four dogs, and three cats. The small table by the pool is at different times of the day a breakfast table, the morning office and dinner area. As the sun sets and Rodricks returns from his passoi (daily evening walk in the village or to the hill close by), candles light up the area. They don't use electricity in this part of the house at night. Four-hundred-and-fifty-year-old Casa Dona Maria is a cultural landmark in the fashion world, almost as famous as its inhabitant. Rodricks bought it for the price of a city SUV in 1993 and named it after the mother-in-law of Olinda Braganza, the lady who sold it to him. He bought the brick-and-mortar structure sitting on half-an-acre of land but inherited the 200-year-old mango trees that yield almost every variety of the fruit grown in the state. By December 2018, Casa Dona Maria will, all Goan gods willing, become Moda Goa -a museum of Goan costume and clothing. Rodricks is on the phone right now, arranging for the money to buy a vintage silver buckle and brooch from a family.It's the price of a Sabyasachi lehenga. "We searched for modern buildings that didn't have the problems of an old structure, but found that houses in Panjim were too close to the river and the water tends to rise up through the laterite stone," says the 56-yearold designer. Meanwhile, Rodricks got an offer to part with Casa Dona Maria for $3 million. The buyer most likely had a boutique hotel in mind. But Rodricks remembered his promise to its previous owner, that he would never break down the house and only make alterations to enhance it. So, for the museum, the windows will be sealed, the rooms will be climate-controlled to save the artefacts from humidity and special cases are being brought in for the precious pieces. The idea of a museum for Goan costume came to Rodricks while working on the book, Moda Goa, about costumes of Goa. And instead of building a new a modern structure, Rodricks decided to move into a rented home two minutes away, and turn Casa Dona Maria into a museum.In fact, the index of the book will form the structure of the museum too. The decision could have been influenced by the excitement of two new design projects -one is changing the Dona Maria from a residence to a commercial space; the second to turn the rental home into a Rodricks-appropriate residence. "I want the museum to run on the American business style model, like the Metropolitan museum (in New York City)," says Rodricks, who has been collecting books for the museum archives since 2010. "I want visitors to spend two, two-and-a-half hours wandering around, and finishing the tour with my mother's prawn curry and rice in the cafeteria. There will also be a photographic archive and library for students who want to research Goan history and clothing. I want it to come alive as a place of learning. Instead of plaques, I want information to be received in the way I am telling you know, like a story. So the curator will be trained to do that. I could helm tours if I am around or if there's a VIP group." The process has already begun to empty the rooms. Rodricks's self-admittedly has the largest collection of contemporary Goan art, and pieces like the Chaitali Morajkar painting, above his desk in the Opium Room, and the furniture in the salon have already been shortlisted for sale to fund the museum trust. Funds for the museum trust are also beings raised by liquidating their real estate assets in Panaji. The only things that will stay are pieces of furniture like the harp-backed choir bench which can be used in the new home or pieces that will not fetch a price because they have been damaged by his pets. "When I moved to Goa, I had this dream of a house with white linens and beige upholstery... Then this happened," he says, pointing at Zeus, a harlequin Great Dane lounging on the colonial fainting couch, nursing a snake bite. "I would have kept a more beautiful house without them." The couple has been in talks with Pundole's Auction house for their artwork and furniture. A spokesperson for the auction house says she hasn't yet seen the pictures of the objects and cannot comment on the period or estimate the money it can raise. The museum will retain the narrative structure of the home. You start by taking the stairs to the salon, which will house the prehistoric costumes kunbi saris, unstitched cloth of the tribals, what the gods wore, and the saris offered to the Shanta Durga goddess. The adjoining Opium Room, named for the opium bed Jerome acquired, will hold clothes with Chinese influence -namely the Pano Bhaju costume used to perform the Mando. Then you will descend to the grand dining room, which sits in the centre of the home. Here you will find clothes with Portuguese influence, like a pristine preserved wedding dress from the 1930s donated by a Goan lady. Parts of a Portuguese altar will stay on the walls like they do now.There will also be accessories such as jewellery, embroidered altar clothes that formed the dowry of a Goan bride, hats and gloves they wore to church, sartorial delicacies such as lintels, powder boxes with feather dusters, and crystal perfume bottles. "The Goans are very stylish people," says Rodricks."The Portuguese arrived in 1510, 25 years before the Mughals. They came here and found that their velvets were not suited to our weather. So they took something from us, and we took something from them. Goan Daivadnya Brahmins, noted for their fine gold filigree, were also the first people to travel to Lisbon for work. The word -IndoWestern -which we throw around so loosely now, started in Goa." Rodricks has been collecting objects of interest since 2010, buying them from families, reaching out through the media to families, asking them to donate or sell their heirlooms. "These pieces of culture deserve a wider audience," he says. "There was this wonderful necklace that I was trying to buy from a lady and she, understandably, wanted to keep it in the family. I reminded her that her descendants would probably just bring it out once or twice in their lifetimes. Here, the family's name and the object would be preserved for posterity." It will also put Colvale on the cultural map. A fashion maven once drawled, "But who will come to Colvale, Wendell?" But that seems set to change. The realisation is that the village is just off the Mumbai Goa highway, five or seven kilometres before Mapusa. The state, as is, has distributed tourism among its beaches, second homes housed in gated communities in villages and cultural landmarks like the Mario Miranda museum in Loutolim. Now, Colvale will also be an interesting stop. THE DONA MARIA MYTH Wendell Rodricks knew of the house in his village, but had never been inside it. One day, in the late 80s, he dreamt of it in detail while he was working in Oman. His mother, Greta, happened to mention this to its owner Olinda, at church. "When your son comes for his holidays next, tell him to come over," Mrs Braganza said. Rodricks did that on his next trip home, and Olinda said, "Since you know my house so well, why don't you take me around." Rodricks surprised her by starting at the salon at the top of the house and ending with her husband's room hidden at the top of the stairs. Seven years later, Braganza was migrating to Canada to be with her children and insisted that Wendell would be the right person to have it.</text>

	<text>We joke that we're the dirty secret of the fashion world," says Doug Gunn, co-founder of The Vintage Showroom, which houses army fatigues, nylon bombers, Japanese embroidered tour jackets and assorted Americana from decades past. He acts as a clothes farm for high-end designers hunting out inspiration. How he's kept it confidential is a miracle  some 50,000 pieces of vintage clothing span his Covent Garden shop and a private warehouse in Notting Hill. But operating in secret is what his clients require. He is in the vintage sourcing business, renting out garments to high-end fashion houses. These items of clothing ultimately inform the prevailing mood or theme of a label's next collection. At 24, David Casavant's New York archive of vintage Raf Simons and Helmut Lang garments has fast become a go-to for Kanye West, Rihanna and rapper Travis Scott. They borrow from his back catalogue for performances or appearances. However, Casavant also loans out to a few major American menswear and denim brands that show on the fashion calendar. "Helmut's a huge draw," he says, "more just from a research standpoint because his clothes are innovative and more constructed." Casavant is proud of his near-complete collection of Simons and Lang, which has swelled to more than 1,000 pieces and has become increasingly scarce. Paul Lawrence, who owns November Books, is one name designers seek out if they're tracking down rare books or visuals to populate their boards. "If people have an idea of what they're looking for but they don't know exactly what material would be available, they'll often ask and I'll go away and find out what exists, whether it's been seen before by anybody else," he says. Top-tier luxury brands often employ someone in a full-time position to source inspiration. These aren't trend forecasters. They are simply inspiration hounds, paid for time their creative director doesn't have. They may do the legwork themselves, but more likely act as inspiration "managers", liaising between vintage sourcers, book shops and the designer. When you're trying to keep up on fashion's proverbial treadmill, there is no time to absorb ideas. "People don't always have time to digest and understand what they're working with or why they're doing something. They're a commercial fashion business. They have to show at least two times a year. They have to produce 50, 60, 70 looks. This doesn't give you much time for reflection," Lawerence says. Luxe fashion is fuelled by exclusivity, so those creating it need to be experts at hiding their sources. "The last few seasons we got a collection of grizzly motorcycle jackets which were a kind of North American biker jacket in leather and sheepskin," explains Gunn. "That's an example of a piece that has been quite literally taken from a vintage garment and different houses have put their own take on it."</text>

	<text>An Indian author who has penned five books so far, Jaishree Misra is one of the 11 TOI Write India authors. In a recent conversation, she shared her expectations from Write India and her experience at the three-day Times Lit Fest Delhi. Excerpts: What do you feel about Write India? I think it's a fabulous way to find new talent while also promoting existing authors. I cannot think of a precedent for such an initiative at all which seems curious, given how simple the concept is. What is also wonderful is the spread of genres and styles covered by the writers who have signed up to the scheme. Between commercial fiction, literary fiction, mythological fiction, historical fiction, romantic fiction... a budding fiction writer has such a rich collection to choose from. What are your expectations from Write India? I fully expect that the competition will throw up at least two or three great new voices that will have publishers scrambling to pull on board. This is likely to happen in a totally unpredictable way as who knows which preface is likely to inspire the best talent. What I would say to the competitors is to try their hand at as many of the stories as possible. When one is starting out, it isn't always clear what genre will best suit one's style and interests. Here then is one way to find out! What kind of a story appeals to you? Which is the book closest to your heart? I write in a kind of half-way house between literary and commercial fiction and enjoy this kind of crossover fiction. Strong stories that are lucid, honest, accessible and written in straightforward prose, neither too flowery nor too plain. Author David Nichols is my current favourite - a book called 'One Day' had me weep and laugh out loud and took me to experiences that I would never have otherwise known. It's a rare treat to find a book which can do all of those things at once. Among Indian writers my favourite is Vikram Seth, mostly for his versatility and, of course, his towering intellect and skill. Any tips you would like to share with the aspiring writers? Try to think of the bare bones of a story and then just start to write. The words will start to flow if there's a story bursting to come out. Don't worry about editing and shaping at this stage because you will have many subsequent drafts to do all the correcting and 'cleaning up'. Never ever imagine that the story is ready to be submitted as soon as it is written. You need to let it stew for a while and then go back to it with a fresh mind to spot all the things that would improve and enhance it. Tell us about your experience at the Times LitFest and are you looking forward to it next year? It was mad and chaotic and lots of fun but what else can one expect from a crazy city like Delhi! Generally the festival events I've attended are a lot more formal, with a definite 'panel discussion' type of structure followed by a controlled Q&amp;A with the audience. Perhaps it was due to the fairly intimate kind of space we had been provided or maybe it was the topic itself (Love and Longing In Indian Fiction) but the audience was a highly engaged one, wanting to be involved from the start, and the moderator had the sense to go with the flow. It felt like a really relaxed party where everyone was doing their own thing and having fun. What are you currently working on? Are you penning down another book? I'm in Kerala at the moment developing my seaside 'writer's retreat' that I hope to offer to struggling writers someday. The writing has had to take a back-seat in that but I can now feel an idea started to bubble away at the back of my mind. It will need to be about Kerala, of course, and could become my first book of non-fiction! By Garima Chamoli</text>

	<text>Title: The End of Plenty: A Global Food Crisis Author: Joel K. Bourne Jr Publisher: Speaking Tiger Pages: 408 Price: Rs.499 With global food shortage peaking in the past decade, American author Joel K. Bourne Jr. paints the vision of an apocalyptic future for humankind if concerted efforts are not made to ward off what Robert Malthus had predicted as the coming of an "agricultural Armageddon." The ideas of the 18th century economist, Malthus, who wrote the classic "Essay on the Principle of Population", are at the heart of "The End of Plenty". Malthus predicted that while human populations will increase at a geometric rate, food production will grow much slower in comparison till, at a point, population growth will exceed the food supply, leading the planet towards certain catastrophe. The burden of "The End of Plenty" is that the global food shortage, which has reached an all-time high over the past decade, is only going to get worse. Bourne's thesis is that the world is not producing enough food for the population - and in a manner that rapidly integrates ecologically destructive and unhealthy methods and technologies to produce larger quantities. The physically harmful techniques include the use of genetically modified crops, synthetic pesticides and fertilizers and technologically-induced water-intensive irrigation involving much use of this precious resource. As a result of the food shortage, prices continue to rise, leaving billions locked in a continuous struggle to afford their meals - or even eat. Bourne cites the Earth Policy Institute to say that as more grain has been diverted to livestock and to the production of biofuels for cars, annual worldwide consumption of grain has risen from 815 million tonnes in 1960 to 2.16 billion in 2008. People are working ways to increase the world's food supply but if population growth is not curbed and if the world continues on its present track, disaster is inevitable, he says. "The End of Plenty" is replete with studies, statistics and facts that Bourne, as a science journalist, has gathered over half-a-century. The mass of cold data, however, is compellingly interwoven with sensory details and imagery. An example is the way Bourne begins. "It is the simplest, most natural of acts, akin to breathing and walking upright. We sit down at the dinner table, pick up a fork and take a juicy bite, oblivious to the double helping of global ramifications on our plate." His account is illustrated with stories from the world over, while India, particularly Punjab, finds central place. He begins with the Bengal Famine of 1943, which killed as many as four million people, and for the following two decades India had to import millions of tonnes of grain to feed its people. With grim examples from Punjab, a state currently in the throes of various agitations, including by farmers, Bourne details the environmental costs of the Green Revolution in India, a country that also has the most number of malnourished. "Better seeds, combined with more fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation, enabled farmers to grow more crop from each acre. Farmers grew so much extra food during the 1960s that they actually helped alleviate global poverty by making food cheaper in most places around the world," he writes. The miracle of the Green Revolution is over in Punjab. Yield growth has tapered off since the mid-1990s. Over-irrigation has led to steep drops in the water table, now tapped by 1.3 million tube wells, while thousands of hectares of productive land have been lost to salinization and waterlogged soil. "Forty years of intensive irrigation, fertilization, and pesticides have not been kind to the loamy gray fields of Punjab. Nor, in some cases, to the people themselves," says Bourne, recounting the tragedy of families stricken by cancer from long exposure to pesticides in food. "Researchers have found pesticides in the Punjabi farmers' blood, their water table, their vegetables, even their wives' breast milk. So many people take the train from the Malwa region to the cancer hospital in Bikaner that it's now called the Cancer Express." To compound the misery, the high cost of fertilizer and pesticides has plunged many Punjabi farmers into debt. One study found more than 1,400 cases of farmers' suicides in 93 villages between 1988 and 2006. According to Bourne, some groups put the total for the state as high as 40,000 to 60,000 suicides over that period. Bourne considers the conditions to restore plenty, including those of land, seed, water and organic farming, but all roads finally lead back to his point of departure - Malthus, who in 1798 wrote..."that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man". The American government and the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations earlier funded a birth control programme in India as part of the Green Revolution, and through the World Bank also financed a sterilisation campaign in the country. However, "The End of Plenty" required to offer a deeper understanding of gender and women's empowerment that is a precondition for effective population control, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. The gap in Bourne's analysis appears more glaring when held up against conditions in India's breadbasket - a strategic border state battling huge problems of drug addiction among male youth, and which almost scrapes the bottom of the barrel among states on the ratio of its female population to males.</text>

	<text>TIRUMALA: Heavy rains past few days brought back the fears of falling boulders and rocks to devotees of lord Balaji who go all the way to TIRUMALA via second ghat road. Recently, landslide fell at 9th km of second ghat road , reminding the scary scenario of November last year where TTD had to force the road for almost one week. Devotees and experts call for permanent and apt measures to for safety on the road. "We never miss darshan of lord Balaji during summer days, boulders were like nightmares to us, even though TTD made all the arrangements for safety" K Rakesh Kumar who travelled to Tirumala from Hyderabad said. In fact, during heavy rainfall November last year TTD diverted the vehicular traffic to the first ghat road via the link road at Mokalimita area connecting the ghat road. TTD got experts from , Chennai, who carried out an inspection. They found that four spots that are highly vulnerable and another 30 with a lesser degree of risk. Based on their recommendations, TTD has taken elaborate precautionary measures with regard to the maintenance of the second road particularly from km 11 km to km 17, the risk area. "We have completed construction of breast walls in most areas as recommended by an expert team, in one month's time we will complete the full work" TTD official from engineering department said. Officials further said that due to invisible expansion effect, trees and water flow the landslides fall. The expansion of rocks happens particularly from 11 to 15 km due to high temperature. The roots of trees are support to some extent, but turn inimical loosening the soil leading to dislocation of rocks. The rains add momentum to landslides. However, worried devotees call for more. They want TTD to take all other suggestions also into consideration. "With impending rains in next few months it is better to get prepared for further effective management more sensitive areas as many families travel via second ghat road " S Rama Rao, a devotee from Kadapa said. Second ghat road has a length of around 17 km and runs steep from km 11 to km 17 and is prone to landslides. Built in 1973 the road was laid by cutting the slope on the hills and rock formations, leaving fractured rocks at many points. The problem of falling landslides began in 2003 on a heavy rainy day. Repairs had to be executed with near Bashyakara Sannidhi junction. Since then any slight disturbance with rain causes falling of boulders or rocks. There has been pending request from many quarters to build a new road. " It is better to lay new road from the link road point parallel to the first ghat road adjacent to Mokalaimitta hill area to a distance of five or six km, avoiding the risky stretch from km 11 to 17 on the second ghat road in rainy season" S Madhusudhan Rao, a retired engineer and devotee of lord Balaji said. Curiously first ghat road build in 1944 still remains untroubled.</text>

	<text>Hyderabad: The people of Hyderabad must take pride in their 'neighbourhoods' and not depend on the government alone to protect them. That's the message conveyed by panelists who participated in The Times of India's 'Let Hyderabad Breathe' event organized at the Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS), Begumpet, on Saturday. The panel discussion was aimed at highlighting the need to preserve Hyderabad's green spaces and root for its sustainable development. The event brought together eminent members of the city, including environmentalists, urban planners, heritage experts, activists and pulmonologists who stressed the need to save our green spaces - like the KBR Park -- that are both historically and environmentally significant. "The Delhi ridge is something there in popular understanding. If the KBR ridge is the pride of the city, then why have we never talked about the KBR Park ridge," said Anant Maringanti, executive director, Hyderabad Urban Lab while sharing a fascinating detail: that the KBR Park is one of the highest parts of the city. "From here (i.e. CESS) if you walk to KBR Park - three or four kilometres - it's a little more than climbing on top of Charminar," he explained. But despite its significance, the park has been consistently tampered with for more than a decade now, lamented CESS professor C Ramachandraiah taking the audience back to 2000-2001 - the second term of N Chandrababu Naidu as chief minister of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh.</text>

	<text>Hyderabad: Two employees of a cash management company siphoned off nearly Rs 10 crore by short-filling automated teller machines (ATMs) in the city. The culprits went absconding after an audit of the cash recently. Tukaramgate police on Saturday said RCI Cash Management Agency, which loads cash into 150 ATMs of SBI and Central Bank of India, were found at fault when the authorities of the two banks, after completion of their agreement period, carried out audit and found large-scale misappropriation. The two employees had siphoned off Rs 9.98 crore in the last two months from 52 ATM kiosks they were handling. Police said the two used to short-fill ATM centres and ensure the kiosks did not reach zero balance level so that the bank would not become suspicious. At the time of loading cash, the ATM machine would not count the quantity of money deposited, unlike the time of disposing the cash. After the cash is loaded, the ATM gives out a slip stating that cash has been added, which would be submitted to the bank concerned as receipt.</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: After several years of development work, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) will, on Monday, launch the re-usable launch vehicle technology demonstrator (RLV-TD) 70-km from earth and hope to bring it back. A successful test launch, which has been postponed multiple times in the last two-and-a-half years, will go a long way in giving Isro a technology that will reduce the launch cost to one tenth of the present expenditure. Isro chairman AS Kiran Kumar had told TOI last month that all tests barring the acoustics test were already done and the vehicle  an aircraft like object that could fly out of the earth's atmosphere and come back  was to be moved to Sriharikota for the launch. Officials in Isro confirmed that the launch is scheduled for 9.30am on Monday. "The vehicle is already in Sriharikota and the launch has been scheduled for Monday morning. The only reason it can be postponed is if the weather in general and wind speed in particular is not conducive for the launch." "Once launched, the vehicle will be guided by our scientists from ground stations and it will also be guided back to land about 500 km from the coast of Chennai," the official said. "The vehicle, a prototype, is a scaled down version about one sixth the size of the intended demonstrator, which is why we need a perfect wind speed," an official explained. The vehicle will be launched on a Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) booster, a version lower than the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The launch vehicle will weigh 90 tonne, while the RLV-TD weighs 300-kg. The winged RLV-TD has been configured to act as a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies like hypersonic flight, autonomous landing, powered cruise flight and flight using air breathing propulsion towards realising a Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) fully reusable launch vehicle. There are two advantages to this technology: It is a crucial part of the proposed manned mission of Isro and it will cut the cost of space launches to one tenth of the present cost. The RLV-TD is part of the pre-launch testing of the proposed human space programme to be carried out for which the UPA-led government had sanctioned Rs 145 crore. Isro has already successfully completed the testing of the crew module, another important technology for the human space programme, last year. Multiple use of vehicle * Launch scheduled for 9.30am on Monday * Isro will test a winged vehicle that'll go 70-km into space and come back * It will be guided to land back in the Bay of Bengal 500-km from Chennai's coast * Technology once proven will cut launch costs to 1/10th of present prices * Design Theory of vehicle aims at multiple uses of vehicle * No such technology presently exists anywhere in the world</text>

	<text>Bengaluru: Late Thursday night showers brought Bengaluru to its knees, yet again exposing the many chinks in the city's infrastructure. What's worse, the tragedy that unfolded doesn't bode well for the upcoming monsoon season. Residents of Nagarjuna Enclave in JP Nagar Phase I stayed wide awake through the night, thanks to an overflowing stormwater drain in the neighbourhood which left their basement flooded. Trouble began when the common wall separating the apartment and the drain collapsed due to the downpour, inundating the basement where 66 four-wheelers and 40 two-wheelers were parked. Within 15 minutes, all vehicles were submerged in muddy water. As if this wasn't enough, at 11.30pm the apartment plunged into darkness. "I was wondering why the generator wasn't turned on, when I heard noises from the hallway. I saw neighbours running downstairs, shouting the basement was flooded," said Madhavi Simha, a resident of the apartment. A Mercedes was reportedly damaged after the debris from a crumbling wall fell on it. "I am worried about my vehicles and not even sure if the insurance company will compensate my loss if they get damaged," said Amresh Ojha, an entrepreneur whose Toyota Etios and Royal Enfield were parked in the basement. With little chances of power supply resuming before a week, most residents have either shifted to hotels or have taken refuge in some relative's house. While some residents skipped work on Friday, many used cabs and autorickshaws, unsure as they were about the condition of their vehicles. (With inputs from Shreyas D and Abhigna Reddy) OFFICIAL APATHY Calls to BBMP and BWSSB were of little help, rued residents. Around 1am, a few beat cops noticed water spewing out of the apartment gates and reported the matter to the fire brigade. Two vehicles were rushed to the spot to pump out the stagnant water. "In the morning, BBMP workers bluntly refused to take control of the situation. Their justification was that apartment complexes don't come under their jurisdiction," said Alka Mittal, a resident of this apartment for 16 years. Even on Friday evening, the vehicles were in 1-foot-deep water, he said. Ironically, the BBMP's lethargic response comes within few hours of it announcing an elaborate plan to tackle monsoon, including setting up control rooms. Only on Thursday, chief minister Siddaramaiah had warned officials of stern action in case of delay in acting on rain and garbage complaints. Five cases of waterlogging were reported from Bommanahalli and three cases of tree fall in Ulsoor, Puttenahalli and JP Nagar. Prashanth Nagar saw two trees uprooted. "We have taken care of everything," claimed a BBMP control room official. FOAM FLOODS ROAD Residents around Yemalur Lake, east Bengaluru, woke up to an unbearable stench on Friday morning, much worse than on normal days. Reason: Froth from the nearby waterbody had spewed on to the road and even landed on the balconies of a nearby apartment. "Though officials had promised that the mess would be fixed before monsoon sets in, the rains are already here. The froth has increased because only the Yemalur exit is open," said Prasad Kempapura, a resident. 60MM RAIN IN AIRPORT The total rainfall recorded in the city between 8.30pm on Thursday and 8.30am Friday was 34.2mm. At Kempegowda International Airport it was 60.6mm. The next two days are expected to see cloudy skies, with a few spells of rain/thundershowers, said the Met department.</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: Aniruddha Voruganti of National Public School (NPS), Koramangala, who has secured 97.2% (486) in CBSE class XII exams, not only knows what he wants to do next, but has also already prepared the roadmap. The highest scorer in the science stream in his school has cleared four stages of interview to pursue medicine at Oxford University from October. He is one among six international students selected for the course in Oxford. But before that, he is happy that he would be able to commit six months to his dream project: Towards A Green Education (TAGE), an organisation that aims to provide free notebooks and stationery to underprivileged rural children and help spread the message of `save paper and reduce its wastage'. "I am glad I would be able to spend time on TAGE. We collect recyclable papers from schools and communities and use the funds generated from its recycling to buy stationery for needy children. We remove blank sheets from our old note books and students of my school bind them into new sets of notebooks for these children," said Aniruddha who is also a guitarist and a table tennis player. He added: "During the past two years, TAGE collected over 6,000 kg of used paper, about 150,000 sheets of blank paper, and made 800 handmade notebooks. TAGE has adopted six government schools in collaboration with Akshara Foundation, and has distributed over 450 stationery sets." Similarly, Gaurang Sriraman of NPS Indiranagar, who has secured 97.4%, is all set to join the Indian Institute of Science as he prefers pure science to engineering. Gaurang, the highest scorer in his school, said, "Our teachers were extremely helpful and would often clear our doubts even through WhatsApp. I qualified for Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana in Class XI with a rank of 222. I have already received the admission letter from IISc. I am into coding and our team won the HP code wars this year." Another student who has scored 97.4% like him is Mehak Arora of NPS Rajajinagar. Mehak says she wants to do computer science engineering from NIT. Meanwhile, Vishnu N Kaushik, of Delhi Public School (DPS), East, who secured 96.6% is now spending his last days in Bengaluru with friends and family as he has secured a seat for aerospace engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. He will leave for the US in August. "I am glad that I will study my favourite subject in Georgia and will carry my basketball and violin. I used to play the violin to stay calm during exams," he said. Aishwariya MR, commerce topper from DPS North with 95.2%, Ridhi Joshi, Humanities topper from the same school with 94.6%, and Mayank Jain, Commerce topper from DPS-East, are all set to pursue law. While Aishwariya will soon begin her law classes in MS Ramaiah Institute of Law, Ridhi and Mayank are waiting for the law entrance exam results. While Sanjana B Acharya, the highest humanities scorer from DPS-East with 94.6%, is preparing to study developmental science and work for the society, Prerna Hiriyiur of Sri Kumarans Children's Home, who secured 98.6% in commerce, wants to higher studies in economics.</text>

	<text>KABUL: Stacked-up shipping containers blocked the streets leading to Kabul's government and diplomatic area on Monday as Afghan authorities prepared for a rally by thousands of members of the Hazara minority over a multi-million dollar power line project. Demonstrators are demanding that the route for the 500 kV transmission line linking Turkmenistan with Kabul be changed to pass through two provinces with large Hazara populations, an option the government says would cost millions and delay the badly needed project by years. As well as the potential for violence, the rally underscores the political tensions facing Ghani's government as it fights the Taliban-led insurgency and tries to get an economy shattered by decades of war back on its feet. The latest protest follows one in November against the murder of a group of Hazara people that became the biggest anti-government demonstration in Kabul for years. Organizers have urged protesters to "shake the palace of despotism". Authorities have closed access to the presidential palace, fearing a repeat of last year's violence, when demonstrators tried to scale the walls. The mainly Shi'ite Hazara have long faced persecution but they are politically well organized and thousands of demonstrators are expected. Hazara leaders, who include senior government members, say the route chosen for the transmission line discriminates against their people, something President Ashraf Ghani and national power company DABS deny. Only around 30 percent of Afghanistan is connected to electricity. Modernizing the creaking power system, which is subject to frequent blackouts, has been a top priority. The transmission line, intended to provide secure power to 10 provinces, is part of the wider TUTAP project backed by the Asian Development Bank to link the energy-rich Central Asia republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Under current plans, due to implemented by 2018, the line would pass from a converter station in the northern town of Pul-e-Khumri through the mountainous Salang pass to Kabul. Demonstrators want an earlier version of the plan that would see a longer route from Pul-e-Khumri through the provinces of Bamyan and Wardak to the west of Kabul. DABS says the current plan ensures ample power to Bamyan and Wardak and that switching the route would add tens of millions of dollars to the cost and delay the project by as much as three years, leaving millions without secure electricity. It has invited Hazara representatives to join a commission to review the plan.</text>

	<text>BANGKOK: One of the two Uighur Muslims from China, accused of planting explosives in Thailand's worst-ever bomb attack on a popular Brahma temple here, today claimed he was being mistreated in custody as he broke down in court shouting "I am human, I am not an animal". Bilal Mohammed alias Adem Karadag, and co-defendant Yusufu Mieraili have been charged with being behind August 2015 bombing at the Brahma shrine in downtown Bangkok that killed 20 people, mostly ethnic Chinese tourists. Mohammed, 31, who appeared shackled and shaven-headed became emotional in front of the assembled media while on way to court hearing. "I am not an animal. I am human, I am human," Mohammad shouted as he was being led to the military court. Sobbing in the courthouse, he alleged that he was being ill-treated and denied halal food. "I cannot eat, I am laughed at when I pray," he added. Police denied the torture allegations. Mohammad was believed to be the man seen in CCTV footage at the shrine last year wearing a yellow T-shirt and placing a backpack allegedly with explosives at the shrine moments before the explosion. Mieraili, also a Chinese Uighur, was accused of delivering the backpack bomb. Both men have denied their role in the bombing. Mohammed's lawyer has previously accused the Thai police of forcing confessions from his client. No group claimed responsibility for the bombing. However, some analysts suspected it might have been the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July last year had forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China, where they may be persecuted. Thai authorities have rejected the theory that the bomb was a revenge attack for the Uighur deportations and claimed that it was done to avenge the government's crackdown on human trafficking gangs. The Uighurs are mainly Muslim minority who face persecution and restrictions on worship in their northwestern Chinese homeland, forcing many to attempt to flee.</text>

	<text>SEOUL: South Korea's Defense Ministry says it's pushing to end most of the existing military service exemptions for men by 2023 to cope with an expected shortage in manpower. A Defense Ministry official said on Tuesday that the plan would require support from other ministries and state agencies to be carried out. South Korea requires able-bodied men to finish two years of military service to maintain a strong force in face of threats from rival North Korea. But according to the Defense Ministry, 28,000 men have been excused from active military duty this year through exemption programs, including service with the country's police and firefighting forces. Engineering and science majors can also opt to temporarily work at small industrial firms and research organizations instead of serving in the military.</text>

	<text>DHAKA: Bangladesh police have arrested an Islamist militant charged with the murder of a professor amid a surge in deadly attacks against liberal activists and other minorities in the South Asian nation, a senior officer said on Tuesday. Rezaul Karim Siddiquee, 58, an English professor at Rajshahi University , was hacked to death on his way to work last month. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the killing of the professor for his "calling to atheism". Police however arrested a member of the banned local militant group, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, thought to have been lying low since six of its leaders were hanged in 2007. The suspect was arrested on Sunday, Rajshahi city police chief Mohammad Shamsuddin said. The Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people has seen a series of attacks over the past year in which atheist bloggers, academics, religious minorities and foreign aid workers have been killed. Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent has also claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, including the killing of two gay rights activists last month. But police say home-grown militant groups are behind the violence. Dozens of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen members have been arrested and at least five killed in shootouts since November, as security forces step up a crackdown on militants seeking to make the moderate Muslim nation a sharia-based state. In 2005, the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen set off nearly 500 bombs almost simultaneously on a single day, including in Dhaka. Subsequent suicide attacks on courts killed 25 people and injured hundreds.</text>

	<text>COLOMBO: More than 150 people are feared dead after they were buried under two landslides triggered by more than three days of heavy rain in central Sri Lanka , disaster officials said on Wednesday as rescuers raced to find survivors and recover the dead. Torrential rains have forced more than 196,000 people from their homes, the latest official data showed, with the recovery of another 19 bodies across the South Asian country bringing the official death toll so far to 35. More than 350 people were plucked to safety during rescue operations in landslide-affected areas across the country early on Wednesday, officials said. Rescue efforts have focused on the town of Aranayaka, 100km north-east of the capital, Colombo, where three villages were buried late on Tuesday in the central district of Kegalle. A Sri Lankan Red Cross official who attended a disaster meeting at the Aranayaka landslide site early on Wednesday said it was feared the death toll was much higher than the official figures listed so far. "At that meeting, it was revealed that around 300-400 people are feared to have died in the Aranayaka landslide," Neville Nanayakkara, director general of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, told Reuters. Nanayakkara was speaking before other officials said that about 150 people had been rescued from the Aranayaka area, leaving fears for the safety of at least another 150 people. The Red Cross has set up a welfare camp for survivors of the Aranayaka landslide. Police said another landslide at Bulathkopitiya, also in Kegalle district, had buried at least 16 people. Military spokesman Jayanath Jayaweera said troops had recovered 13 bodies from the Aranayaka site and three from Bulathkopitiya. He said the 150 people who were rescued from Aranayaka earlier on Wednesday had been sent to six camps set up for displaced people in the area. Troops using boats and helicopters also pulled to safety more than 200 people trapped in the north-western coastal district of Puttalam, Jayaweera said. Flooding and drought are cyclical in Sri Lanka, which is battered by a southern monsoon between May and September, while a north-eastern monsoon runs from December to February.</text>

	<text>JAKARTA: Rescuers have found more bodies after a volcano erupted in western Indonesia, raising the death toll to six, an official said on Sunday. Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province blasted volcanic ash as high as 3 kilometers into the sky on Saturday, said National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said ash tumbled down the slopes as far as 4.5 kilometers westward into a river. The mountain had been dormant for four centuries before reviving in 2010, killing two people. An eruption in 2014 killed 16 people. All the victims of Saturday's eruption were working on their farms in the village of Gamber, about 4 kilometers away from the slope, or within the danger area. Video images showed dead farm animals covered in dust. Nugroho said soldiers, police, and rescuers from disaster combatting agencies, as well as volunteers and villagers, were searching for more possible victims. Mount Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific "Ring of Fire,'' an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.</text>

	<text>MANILA: Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) said on Monday that its board has appointed a new president replacing Lorenzo Tan, who resigned but was cleared by the Philippine bank of any wrongdoing in a $81 million money laundering scandal. Gil Buenaventura, currently president and CEO of state-run Development Bank of the Philippines, will take over as RCBC president and CEO from July 1, RCBC said in a statement. The veteran banker is a former senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Bank of the Philippine Islands, one of the country's three biggest lenders. RCBC, the country's ninth-largest lender by assets, said on May 6 that it had accepted the resignation of Tan. In early February, unidentified hackers infiltrated the computers at the Bangladesh central bank and tried to transfer $951 million from its settlement account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Most transfers were blocked, but $81 million was sent to four accounts at a branch of RCBC and then moved through a remittance firm and later to casinos and gambling agents. Most of that money is missing. The Philippine Senate is scheduled to resume its money-laundering probe on May 19.</text>

	<text>SEOUL: South Korea, the US and Japan will hold their first joint military training next month focused on cooperating to detect signs of missile launches from North Korea and trace missile trajectories, a Seoul defense official said today. The drills set for around June 28 will be held on the sidelines of biennial multinational naval exercises scheduled for waters of Hawaii from June to August, which the three countries regularly attend, the official said requesting anonymity citing department rules. The trilateral drills will involve Aegis-equipped ships from the three countries, but that they will not involve missile-interception training, the official said. The three countries have held joint search-and-rescue drills in the past. The training follows the 2014 intelligence-gathering pact among the three countries designed to better cope with North Korea's increasing nuclear and missile threats. It was the first such agreement among the three countries. An international standoff over North Korea has recently deepened after Pyongyang carried out its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February. Washington regularly holds military drills with South Korea and Japan which together host about 80,000 American troops and share intelligence with them on a bilateral level. But Seoul and Tokyo don't, largely a result of lingering public resentments in South Korea against Japan over its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The Korean Peninsula was divided into a US-backed South Korea and a Soviet-supported, socialist North Korea at the end of the Japanese occupation. The two Koreas fought a devastating three-year war in the early 1950, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.</text>

	<text>KABUL: Afghan authorities scrambled on Sunday to confirm the fate of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour after US officials said he was likely killed in drone strikes -- a potential blow to the resurgent militant movement. The Taliban have not commented officially on the very rare US attack deep inside Pakistan on Saturday, authorised by President Barack Obama, which could scupper any immediate prospect of peace talks. The apparent elimination of Mansour, who had consolidated power following a bitter Taliban leadership struggle over the past year, could also spark new succession battles within the fractious movement. "Mansour was the target and was likely killed" in the remote Pakistani town of Ahmad Wal in Balochistan province by multiple unmanned aircraft operated by US special forces, an American official said Saturday. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's office on Sunday confirmed the strike, adding that they were investigating whether Mansour had in fact been killed. The deaths of Taliban leaders have often been falsely reported. Mansour himself was rumoured to have been killed last December. "The Afghan government is trying to gather details regarding the fate of Mullah Mansour," the presidential palace said in a statement. "This drone strike shows that terrorists fuelling conflict will not be safe anywhere." Two Pakistani intelligence officials told AFP the drones struck a Toyota Corolla near the city of Quetta, killing two people whose bodies were burned beyond recognition. They did not confirm whether Mansour was among them but said the bodies had been moved to a hospital in Quetta. A member of the Quetta Shura, the Taliban's leadership council, told AFP that Mansour had been unreachable on his mobile phone since Saturday night. "We are not sure if something is really wrong or he purposely switched off his phone fearing an attack," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. Mansour was formally appointed head of the Taliban in July last year following the revelation that the group's founder Mullah Omar had been dead for two years. The group saw a resurgence under the firebrand supremo with striking military victories, helping to cement his authority by burnishing his credentials as a commander. The Taliban briefly captured the strategic northern city of Kunduz last September in their most spectacular victory in 14 years. The southern opium-rich province of Helmand is also almost entirely under insurgent control. "Mansour posed... an imminent threat to US personnel, Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces," US Secretary of State John Kerry said during a visit to Myanmar Sunday. "He was also directly opposed to peace negotiations." But Mansour's apparent death was not immediately seen as likely to push the Taliban closer to peace talks. It could press them to show they are still able to wage an aggressive battle, observers say. "The war has been going on for so long, the Taliban has so many leaders and so much ability to function at the local level even without strong central guidance, that we would be well advised to keep expectations in check," said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution think-tank. The drone attack came just days after representatives from the US, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan held another round of negotiations in Islamabad aimed at reviving long-stalled direct peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. However pressure has been building in recent months for the United States to return to direct attacks on the Taliban, particularly via air strikes. NATO ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in December 2014, pulling out the bulk of its troops, although a 13,000-strong residual force remains for training and counterterrorism operations. The Taliban, who announced the start of their annual spring offensive last month, have already stepped up their campaign against the Western-backed Kabul government for the season. If Mansour's death is confirmed, his two newly named deputies -- influential religious leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and Sirajuddin Haqqani -- could likely step up to fill the power vacuum. Omar's son Mullah Yakoub, although deemed young and inexperienced, is also favoured by some Taliban commanders for the leader's post.</text>

	<text>COLOMBO: At least 12 people were killed and four went missing in Sri Lanka due to flash floods and landslides overnight, the Disaster Management Centre said. Rescue efforts were hampered on Tuesday due to heavy rains and strong winds in many parts of the country, Xinhua news agency reported. A total of 134,466 people were temporarily placed in over 170 safe houses set up across the country. Authorities warned that water levels in several areas would rise. Landslide warnings remained in at least nine districts. President Maithripala Sirisena called for immediate action to provide food supply and assistance to thousands affected by the extreme weather and ordered the armed forces to provide assistance. The meteorology department has warned that strong winds and heavy showers were expected to continue for another 36 hours.</text>

	<text>COLOMBO: Sri Lankan soldiers pulled more bodies from landslides and distributed food and water to hundreds of thousands of residents camped in shelters on Sunday after major floods hit the island. Floodwaters were receding in the capital Colombo after the heaviest rains in a quarter of a century pounded the island since last weekend, triggering landslides that have buried victims in tonnes of mud. Soldiers and other rescuers discovered 13 more bodies late on Saturday in the worst-hit district of Kegalle, about 100 kilometres northeast of Colombo, where two villages were destroyed last week. More than 80 people are known to have died so far across the island amid fears the number could rise -- with 118 people still listed as missing. "The search will continue for some more time even though we have not found anyone alive during these search operations," Disaster Management Centre spokesman Pradeep Kodippili said of the landslides in Kegalle, where a total of 48 bodies have been found. Sri Lanka was receiving international aid for more than half a million people forced to flee their homes across the island. Soldiers joined relief workers in distributing essential supplies to around 300,000 people sheltering in state-run centres, Kodippili told AFP. After bursting its banks last week, the Kelani river running through Colombo was receding slowly. But some 200,000 people living in low-lying areas of the capital were still unable to return home, he said. "The next big challenge is the clean-up operation, but it can start only in a few days when the waters go down completely." Rain has eased since Cyclone Roanu moved away from Sri Lanka to hit southern Bangladesh overnight, leaving at least 24 people dead there before weakening. President Maithripala Sirisena has called on Sri Lankans to provide shelter and give cash or essential supplies to its flood victims. The appeal prompted huge numbers to donate food and clothing, according to Disaster Management Centre officials.</text>

	<text>HONG KONG: One of China.s most powerful official lands in HONG KONG on Tuesday in an attempt to build bridges in the divided city, but the trip has already stirred anger among opponents. The three-day visit by Zhang Dejiang , who chairs China's communist-controlled legislature, is the first by such a senior official in four years and comes as concerns grow in semi-autonomous Hong Kong that Beijing is tightening its grip. While Zhang is ostensibly visiting to speak at an economic conference tomorrow, the trip is widely seen as a bid to take the temperature in an increasingly febrile political climate which has fostered a fledgling independence movement, riling China. As part of the trip, Zhang will meet with a group of veteran pro-democracy lawmakers tomorrow evening, a rare move observers say is designed to defuse frustrations. "It is really time for him to meet with non-establishment legislators, to hear our analysis of how Hong Kong ended up where we are today, and what are the ways forward," Civic Party lawmaker Alan Leong, who is part of the invited group, told AFP. However, only four pro-democracy legislators will gather with Zhang and protest groups voiced anger they were being kept away from the venue where he will speak. The harbourfront conference centre is barricaded off and demonstrators will be confined to designated areas out of sight. "Zhang Dejiang is coming here to understand the situation in Hong Kong but now his eyesight will be completely blocked," said Sham Tsz-kit of Civil Human Rights Front. Paving stones in the area have been glued down to prevent protesters using them as missiles. That comes after demonstrators dug up and threw bricks during running battles with police in February. Zhang's visit is expected to help Beijing gauge whether unpopular city leader Leung Chun-ying should stand for another term. His current stint ends in March 2017. Like all Hong Kong leaders, Leung was chosen by a 1,200-member committee stacked with Beijing loyalists. Mass rallies in 2014 for fully free leadership elections failed to win political reform. Since then, young campaigners have become increasingly frustrated with intransigence in Hong Kong and Beijing, with some now saying they will not stop at violence to force change. Pro-democracy legislator Emily Lau, one of the groups to meet Zhang, said she would portray Leung as a divisive force. "I'm going to tell him (Zhang) that Hong Kong is facing the most difficult situation since the handover," she added. Hong Kong is semi-autonomous since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997, with freedoms unseen on the mainland, but there are fears they are being stripped away. Those concerns were exacerbated by the disappearance at the end of last year of five Hong Kong booksellers known for publishing salacious titles about China's political leaders. The five men resurfaced in the mainland and four are now under criminal investigation.</text>

	<text>KABUL, Afghanistan  Since he first picked up a gun as a 15-year-old, Abdul Basir has killed a lot of people. Yet the operation on Friday night was different: He was out to kill his son. Around midnight on Friday, Basir, now in his 40s and the commander of a government militia in the northern Afghan province of Faryab, arrived at a compound in an area called Zyaratgah, part of the restive Qaisar District. He had intelligence that his 22-year-old son, Said Muhammad, a hardened member of the Taliban , was there with several of his fighters. In Afghanistan's long war, Basir's determination to kill one of his children was not unique, but rather just another sign of how long the violence has dragged on, and of how it has permeated the deepest levels of society and poisoned the closest of relationships. Framed by grand ideologies and elaborate strategies at the top, the perpetual conflict has divided families for a generation. Guerrillas who took up arms against the Soviet occupation became sworn enemies of their communist relatives. Now, a government commander was hunting down a son who had denounced him as an infidel and forced him from their family's ancestral village. "I went with full confidence  I wanted to kill him first," Basir said in a telephone interview on Sunday. "It is up to God, but I think his blood is legitimate for me." Basir's men barged into the compound, entering on the second floor, which they found empty. On the first floor, they spotted Muhammad trying to escape. Basir aimed his Kalashnikov rifle and opened fire. "He dropped from the window, and I thought I killed him," Basir said. Three Taliban fighters were killed in the operation, but not Muhammad. He was wounded in the head, Basir said, but somehow made his way back to the family village, which is now under his control. "It doesn't surprise me at all to see members of the same family fighting in two fronts," said Faizullah Jalal, a professor of political science at Kabul University. The case in Faryab, Jalal said, is a continuation of a phenomenon that reached its peak during the 1980s, with clashes between the communist government in Kabul and guerrillas who received support from the CIA. "There were many cases where a son was on one side and the father on the other side, and the differences were so deep that they were willing to kill each other if they could," he said. "It wasn't just one or two or even 100 cases, but thousands." Even as the leadership on both sides of the conflict has eroded, with the fundamentalist Taliban increasingly acting like a drug cartel and the government drowning in corruption, the ideological pull at the lower levels remains strong. As the leaders prosper, the foot soldiers on both sides continue to die in large numbers, sometimes at the hands of their relatives. Basir is a product of a war with many chapters but no apparent ending. He was the age of a high school freshman when he joined the ranks of a warlord. The Soviets, their empire on the verge of disintegration, were withdrawing from Afghanistan, and the conflict they were leaving behind would soon turn into a bitter civil war. Basir has not put down his guns since, not even when militiamen like him were supposedly disarmed during a costly campaign financed by international donors after the US invasion. "I have killed at least 150 Taliban, with my own hands, with my own bullets," Basir boasted. But the struggle turned personal when his son became an enemy. About five years ago, Basir said, he realized that Said had come under the influence of a local cleric who had ties to the Taliban. One day, when Basir's militia was operating in a different part of Faryab, his son formally joined the militants. Even worse, he took his father's cache of about 50,000 Kalashnikov bullets, 42 magazines and one Kalashnikov. Basir was angry but forgiving. After all, it was his own blood. Local elders mediated, and after much effort Muhammad returned to his family. To prove that he had given up on the insurgency, he joined the Afghan army, serving for 2 1/2 years in eastern Paktia province. But Basir, who has seven other children, questioned whether Muhammad's beliefs had changed, and feared that he might betray his comrades, perhaps by surrendering army posts to the militants. Last year, Muhammad bore out Basir's suspicions by returning to the Taliban, and he eventually made his father an outcast. "I told him: 'Come, my son, I want to arrange a wife for you, get you married,'" Basir said. A second son, Abdul Rahman, 20, has also joined the Taliban, but Basir said Abdul Rahman was not as "brutal" as Said. (Like many Afghans, the family does not use a common surname.) Basir said Muhammad had threatened to "kill me  he will skin me." The decision to try to kill his son was the last resort, Basir said, after he realized there was no hope of a return. On Friday, the police chief of Qaisar District, Lt. Nizamuddin, received a call from Basir, asking for reinforcements. "He told me he had called his son many times to leave the Taliban, but he had refused," the lieutenant said. "He wanted to go get him." And Basir had no plans for an arrest  he went to Zyaratgah to kill. Now that Muhammad has survived, the plan will not change. "I will kill him," Basir said. "He is a Talib. I cannot have mercy."</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON/KABUL: Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in a rare US drone strike deep inside Pakistan, the Afghan spy agency announced on Sunday. Mansour's death is a body blow for the insurgents and removes a major obstacle to the fragile peace process in war-torn Afghanistan. Mansour and another militant were targeted by multiple unmanned aircraft operated by US Special Operations forces on Saturday as the duo rode in a vehicle in a remote area near the town of Ahmad Wal in the restive Baluchistan province close to the Afghan border, US officials said. Afghanistan's main spy agency said Mansour was killed in a US drone attack inside Pakistan. "Mansour was being closely monitored for a while ... until he was targeted along with other fighters aboard a vehicle ... in Balochistan," the National Directorate of Security said in a brief statement. Speaking to reporters in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw, US secretary of state John Kerry said, "Mansour posed ... an imminent threat to US personnel, Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces." Kerry said Mansour was also directly opposed to peace negotiations. The US "has long maintained that an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned reconciliation process is the surest way to ensure peace ... peace is what we want, Mansour was a threat to that," Kerry added. The Pentagon earlier confirmed it targeted Mansour, said to be in his early 50s, in an operation authorized by President Barack Obama. The deaths of Taliban leaders have sometimes been falsely reported. Mansour himself was said to have been killed last December. Mansour assumed the leadership in July 2015, replacing Taliban founder and the one-eyed reclusive long-time spiritual head Mullah Mohammad Omar in Pakistan in 2013. "Mansour has been the leader of the Taliban and actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners," said Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook. "Mansour has been an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, prohibiting Taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the Afghan government that could lead to an end to the conflict," he said. The drone strike inside Pakistan was a rare one since US Navy Seals killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden in a stealth raid in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in 2011. "Since the death of Mullah Omar and Mansour's assumption of leadership, the Taliban have conducted many attacks that have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces as well as numerous US and Coalition personnel," Cook said. The United States informed both Pakistan and Afghanistan shortly after the strike, a senior White House official said.</text>

	<text>LUDHIANA: When all other students were busy preparing for the final exams, 19 years old Shubhank Shukla, a student of DAV Public School, BRS Nagar was undergoing chemotherapy to fight with Acute Lymphatic leukemia (ALL)- a type of cancer. However, fighting all odds, Shubhank managed to score 83 percent marks in the class XII-Non-medical stream. Shubhank who hails from Lucknow shifted here in the city last year. The very first challenge for their parents was to get him admission in a good school as she was an average student because of his health issues. However understanding his medical condition DAV Public School, BRS Nagar accepted him and gave him admission in class XII. Talking to TOI over phone, Sbhubhank said, "I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic leukemia (ALL), which is a type of cancer, in class VI. This diseased stopped my growth and made me skinny. I was unable to stand or to walk for a long time." Shubhank was admitted in Leelawati Hospiptal, Mumbai and SGPGI Hospital, Lucknow for a long time. In the meanwhile his father, Vigyaneshwar Shukla, who presently is the zonal head of Bank of India, got transferred in Ludhiana. "My treatment was going on but soon after coming to Ludhiana I started recovering. I have undergone chemotherapy and I used to miss classes but I am glad that my school and my teachers supported me. They used to teach me in extra classes for that I can cover up my syllabus" shared Shubhank. Moreover, with the help of teachers Shubhank managed to score 83 percent marks, as earlier he was an average student. "I am quite happy that now I am back to normal. I have recovered now and started scoring good marks. I really thank my school and my parents who never gave up on me" he added. Shubhank's father Vigyaneshwar Shukla said, "I have always believed in my son and was confident enough that he would fight with all odds. I am proud of him as he has remained so optimistic and tough." Shubhank says that his aim is to become Certified Information system Auditor (CISA) but prior to that he would pursue BCom and MBA degree. In the end Shubhank gives a message, "Like an arrow- when life pushes you back, it mean it is going to launch you into something great."</text>

	<text>LUCKNOW: It was 11.02 am Saturday, when Buddha eventually smiled on DIG technical services Aparna Kumar, as she scaled Mount Everest - the highest peak in the world - in her third attempt. Minutes later, director general of police of UP Javeed Ahmed tweeted Aparna's feat, and subsequently Union home minister Rajnath Singh also tweeted and congratulated Aparna on her success. Expressing happiness on Aparna's successful climb of Mount Everest, her husband Sanjay Kumar (who is the district magistrate of Allahabad), said, "Bravo!!! She did it on her third attempt!!! The much awaited good news has finally arrived. Aparna scaled the Mount Everest, the highest peak of the world today at 11.02 am IST." He further stated that she is the first ever all-India service officer (male or female) to scale the highest peak of six out of seven continents. "She unfurled the national tricolor and flag of UP Police at the summit. A proud moment for the nation and UP Police," Sanjay Kumar said, and added that Aparna is already on way back to camp 4 and it will be two days before she comes within the communication range. "Thanks all for the good wishes and prayers. We are proud of her as ever. God bless," Sanjay Kumar said. An avalanche in 2014, and an earthquake in 2015 had prevented Aparna from scaling Mount Everest in her earlier attempts. In January this year, Aparna became the country's first civil servant to scale Mount Vinson Massif, the highest peak in the Antarctica. She achieved the feat on January 17. The mountaineer has set higher goals for herself. She plans to scale Mount McKinley in Alaska in July-August. A charm for mountaineering equipment prompted Aparna to enroll herself for a month-long basic mountaineering course at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports in Manali in October 2013. This was followed by an advance course in July 2014. The mountaineer cop scaled Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in August 2014, the highest peak in Africa, and continued to train for her next expedition. In November, she climbed the Carstensz Pyramid peak in West Papuan province of Indonesia, the highest peak in Australia and Oceania region. In March 2015, the female IPS officer was conferred with the Rani Lakshmi Bai Puraskar by UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav for her achievements and for being a role model to women. On eve of the Republic Day this year, Aparna was also awarded the special DGP Commendation Disc for her achievements.</text>

	<text>All-male panels may soon be a thing of the past. Now, feminists are calling out organisers who turn the dais into a manference Over a year ago David Hasselhoff, the alpha male once-lifeguard from Baywatch, found himself a new (uninvited) career as the mascot of the 'manel' - the all-male panel. He appeared on a Tumblr called All Male Panels, started in Feb last year by Finnish feminist researcher Dr Saara Sarma. The Tumblr wanted to highlight the gender lopsidedness of discussion panels and other high altars of expertise and experience, like say, state cabinets and boardrooms. Sarma invited people to send in flyers or pictures of all-male events and seminars, which received Hasselhoff's virile stamp of approval: 'Congrats, you have an all male panel!' The manel is being named and shamed worldwide, with memes, online petitions, boycotts and even spoken word poetry slamming it. 'Group thinking turns into brain shrinking; humans seeking meaning and development, male-only panels are such an embarrassment' raps Sofie Sandell, professional speaker and digital leader on YouTube. In India too, the stew's beginning to simmer. Last year, Sairee Chahal, founder of Sheroes and Fleximoms  career communities for women  was invited to a top tech conference in Bangalore. "It has typically been a bro affair, but the organisers wanted to do an all-women panel for the first time, alongside their regular all-male sessions, Chahal recalls, "They had no context for the panel - the organisers asked me to identify women panelists and a suitable subject. We didn't do it eventually because the four other women I'd approached from tech felt there was no purpose to the panel." Companies and conference organisers who are inviting a lone woman to a male-heavy dais simply to avoid the label of sexism are now being called out. Ashwini Asokan, co-founder and CEO of the Artificial Intelligence company, Mad Street Den, has been challenging sexism in the tech industry and got trolled for it. In fact, sexist putdowns are often what hold women back from taking the stage. "Several women started conversations on Twitter saying they lacked the confidence because of bullies and trolls," says Asokan. She points out that India has more female engineering and computer science graduates than most countries (30- 40% of college seats), giving the lie to the specious claim that suitable women experts simply cannot be found. "It's why I pick up the phone, find them and push them to these panels," Asokan says. To counter the old boys clubs that conferences and seminars have become, Asokan suggests that women create their own networks. "I was one of the biggest promoters of the Grace Hopper (Celebration of Women in Computing) conferences," she says, "I believe women-only events are a great training field; if you're shy to get up on a mixed gender panel and get bullied, here's where you start. Hopefully, in a few years we won't need women-only conferences at all." Several women's organisations globally are building databases of women leaders and experts (a woman can nominate herself). Some like the UK-based Her Say and The Women's Room are also shoring up female experts across disciplines who can comment in the media (only 24% of women are heard, seen or read about in traditional media globally, revealed the Global Media Monitoring Project 2015). ElsaMarie D'Silva, MD and co-founder of Red Dot Foundation, and her colleague, the Kenya-born Esther Ngumbi are assembling a crowd-sourced directory of women experts from around the world; they've got 500 profiles from 45 countries so far. "Filling panel spots with known names (often men) is easy. How can one discuss a topic of any importance without considering the views of 50% of the population?" says D'Silva, a resident of Mumbai. So far two international organisers in Australia and Shanghai have already reached out to them. Phase two will put those profiles on a map with the public listings. D'Silva and Ngumbi recently wrote a blog post on GoodMenProject.com, appealing to men to also weigh in on the debate. In January, in a domino effect, three leading comics artists withdrew from the lifetime achievement award shortlist of a major comic-books festival in France because it was all-male, prompting several others to bow out as well in protest. In Australia earlier this month five male 'star' speakers pledged to boycott panels that weren't gender-diverse. Quartz also featured Sree Sreenivasan, the chief digital officer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as one of those pledging to give all-male panels a miss. But a panel is only one Tetris block; it needs to fit in with others to move the bar. An organization that doesn't channel more women into leadership roles would have accomplished nothing more than window dressing by asking a woman to a panel. "Women don't crave patriarchal pats on the back; they deserve equal participation in public life. Their voices need to be respected and actioned. Women who speak up in public fora are called 'aggressive', 'militant', 'trouble-makers' and worse," says columnist Shobhaa De, who for years has occupied a place at the conference table. "I make sure I am heard loudly and clearly when I sign up for these panels. I turn the 'feeble' questions around when required. If it's an important enough panel discussion, I don't care if I am there as a 'token woman'  I make sure I have my say regardless." Dictionary for dudes: Mansplaining: When a man explains something to a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing. Or as Urban Dictionary puts it: telling a woman she's wrong, even when she actually is Manspreading: When a man sits with his legs wide apart, invading the space of the occupant next to him. However, as UB points out, when women set large purses and shopping bags next to them and take up another seat, it goes unnoticed and is generally dismissed Manslamming: When a man slams into a woman while walking because he won't alter his course Manterrupting: The unnecessary interruption of a woman by a man, often in the workplace Bropriate: When a man appropriates a woman's ideas and passes them off as his own</text>

	<text>Many successful Indian politicians are conspicuously single. The idea of a 24x7 neta minus parivar is obviously appealing Apart from their remarkable victories, what links J Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee and Sarbananda Sonowal? That they stand alone, with no immediate families around them. Out of this year's crop of chief ministers, Pinarayi Vijayan is the odd one out, for having a spouse and children. In a country that invests greatly in marriage and family, most successful politicians are conspicuously single. East, west, north or south, from Nitish Kumar to Mayawati, Vasundhara Raje to Naveen Patnaik, from Narendra Modi to Rahul Gandhi, there is no significant other by their side. What gives? Some, like Modi, have tried to spin their single status into a virtue  "I have no family ties, I am single. Who will I be corrupt for?" he asked during his prime-ministerial campaign. This is a view with wide traction; though there is zero evidence linking family ties with corruption. Besides, as Indians have observed, the absence of a formal family unit does not mean that an intimate circle cannot profit from their power. Foster families, close aides and their kin, nephews and nieces fill that space. So what purpose does singlehood serve in the public imagination? For one, there is the impression that "they have no other cause but the people, that their time, attention and priorities revolve around politics", says journalist Sankarshan Thakur. "In India, where politicians spend so much time with their supporters and constituents, the early grind can be very demanding," says social commentator Santosh Desai. Except it doesn't work that way, in general  marital status and work productivity are not at odds. Data suggests a "marriage wage premium" for men, meaning that married men tend to be more successful at work. But facts apart, there is an obvious appeal to the idea that being unmarried allows a person to be a 24x7 politician. Free of household duties, they can channel their energies into politics. "Chamaari hoon, kunwari hoon, tumhari hoon", was Mayawati's appeal to the electorate. Female politicians are readily understood as archetypes when they are single, says sociologist Shiv Visvanathan. "Whether it is Jayalalithaa's legendary excess or Mamata's legendary simplicity, their being single gives them a certain mystique," he says. In a male-dominated politics, it is important for them to be seen as self-directed and confidently alone to exert authority. But for most politicians, their singlehood is a matter-of-fact affair. In a country like the US, the First Spouse is vitally important, and families are put on display to testify to the candidate's credibility. Bachelordom would be suspect in such a context. "Our political culture is different, and families have always receded into the background," says Thakur. Wives and husbands are rarely seen and never heard. The media and public have largely refrained from prying into their romantic lives, considering it irrelevant to their political actions. "The separation between inside and outside is clear, in India. The face a politician presents to the world, and his or her private life, is seen as distinct," says Desai. In fact, the domestic life has often been cast as an encumbrance. Right from Mohandas Gandhi, whom Thakur calls India's first "married-single" politician, to Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Vajpayee, few of our leaders have been one half of a happy couple. Traditionally, even those who are married do not wheel their partners into the public eye, he notes. They are excused for being negligent towards their family for the sake of pressing public commitments. Of course, there is no one reason why people  politicians or otherwise  remain single. Some may not have found the right person, some may have willingly chosen not to marry, others may have romantic entanglements that never materialised into marriage, and some are estranged from their partners. Some are single because of their backgrounds, as RSS workers or preachers. There is no one explanation for their single status  "If you look at Vasundhara Raje or Mayawati or Nitish Kumar, their lives are so disparate, it is hard to find anything in common but the fact that they are all single," Thakur sums up.</text>

	<text>In his latest work, The Gene, an Intimate History, Pulitzer-winning author and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee examines the role of heredity in our lives On October 6, 1942, five years before my father's family left Barisal, my mother was born twice in Delhi. Bulu, her identical twin, came before her, placid and beautiful. My mother, Tulu, emerged several minutes later, squirming and crying murderously. The midwife must, fortunately, have known enough about infants to recognize that the most beautiful are often the most damned: the quiet twin, on the edge of listlessness, was quite severely undernourished and had to be swaddled in blankets and revived. The first few days of my aunt's life were the most tenuous. She could not suckle at the breast, the story runs (perhaps apocryphally), and there were no infant bottles to be found in Delhi in the forties, so she was fed through a cotton wick dipped in milk, and then from the caul of a cowrie shell shaped like a spoon. A nurse was hired to tend to her. When the breast milk began to run dry at seven months, my mother was quickly weaned to let her sister have its last remnants. Right from the onset, then, my mother and her twin were living experiments in genetics  emphatically identical in nature and emphatically divergent in nurture. My mother  the "younger" of the two by minutes  was boisterous. She had a slippery, mercurial temper. She was carefree and fearless, fast to learn and willing to make mistakes. Bulu was physically timid. Her mind was more agile, her tongue sharper, her wit more lancing. Tulu was gregarious. She made friends easily. She was impervious to insults. Bulu was reserved and restrained, quieter and more brittle. Tulu liked theater and dancing. Bulu was a poet, a writer, a dreamer. Yet the contrasts only highlighted the similarities. Tulu and Bulu looked strikingly similar: they had the same freckled skin, almond-shaped face, and high cheekbones, unusual among Bengalis, and the slight downward tilt of the outer edge of the eye, the trick that Italian painters used to make Madonnas seem to exude a mysterious empathy. They shared the inner language that twins often share. They had jokes that only the other twin understood. Over the years, their lives drifted apart. Tulu married my father in 1965 (he had moved to Delhi three years earlier). It was an arranged marriage, but also a risky one. My father was a penniless immigrant in a new city, saddled with a domineering mother and a half-mad brother who lived at home. To my mother's overly genteel West Bengali relatives, my father's family was the very embodiment of East Bengali hickness: when his brothers sat down to lunch, they would pile their rice in mounds and punch volcanic holes in it for gravy, as if marking the insatiable, perpetual hunger of their village days in the form of craters on their plates. Bulu's marriage seemed a vastly safer prospect by comparison. In 1966, she was engaged to a young lawyer, the eldest son of a well-established clan in Calcutta. In 1967, Bulu married him and moved to his family's sprawling, decrepit mansion in South Calcutta, with a garden already choked by weeds. By the time I was born, in 1970, the sisters' fortunes had started to move in unexpected directions. In the late 1960s, Calcutta began its steady descent into hell. Its economy was fraying, its tenuous infrastructure heaving under the weight of waves of immigration. Internecine political movements broke out frequently, shuttering the streets and businesses for weeks. As the city convulsed between cycles of violence and apathy, Bulu's new family hemorrhaged its savings to keep itself afloat. Her husband kept up the pretense of a job, leaving home every morning with the requisite briefcase and tiffin box  but who needed a lawyer in a city without laws? Eventually, the family sold the mildewing house, and moved into a modest two-room flat  just a few miles from the house that had sheltered my grandmother on her first night in Calcutta. My father's fate, in contrast, mirrored that of his adoptive city. Delhi, the capital, was India's overnourished child. Bolstered by the nation's aspirations to build a mega-metropolis, fattened by subsidies and grants, its roads widened and its economy expanded. My father rose through the ranks of a Japanese multinational firm, clambering swiftly from lower-to upper-middle class. We vacationed in Europe. We learned to eat with chopsticks and swam in hotel pools in the summer. When the monsoons hit Calcutta, the mounds of garbage on the streets clogged the drains and turned the city into a vast infested swamp. One such stagnant pond, festering with mosquitoes, was deposited yearly outside Bulu's house. She called it her own "swimming pool." There is something in that comment  a lightness  that was symptomatic. You might imagine that the sharp vicissitudes of fortune had reshaped Tulu and Bulu in drastically different ways. On the contrary: over the years, their physical resemblance had dwindled to the point of vanishing, but something ineffable about them  an approach, a temperament  remained remarkably similar and even amplified in its convergence. Despite the growing economic rift between the two sisters, they shared an optimism about the world, a curiosity, a sense of humor, an equanimity that borders on nobility but comes with no pride. When we traveled abroad, my mother would bring home a collection of souvenirs for Bulua wooden toy from Belgium, fruit-flavored chewing gum from America that smelled of no earthly fruit, or a glass trinket from Switzerland. My aunt would read travel guides of the countries that we had visited. "I've been there too," she would say, arranging the souvenirs in a glass case, with no trace of bitterness in her voice. There is no word, or phrase, in the English language for that moment in a son's consciousness when he begins to understand his mother  not just superficially, but with the immersive clarity with which he understands himself. My experience of this moment, somewhere in the depths of my childhood, was perfectly dual: as I understood my mother, I also learned to understand her twin. I knew, with luminous certainty, when she would laugh, what made her feel slighted, what would animate her, or where her sympathies or affinities might lie. To see the world through the eyes of my mother was to also see it through the eyes of her twin, except, perhaps, with lenses tinted in slightly different colors. What had converged between my mother and her sister, I began to realize, was not personality but its tendency  its first derivative, to borrow a mathematical term. In calculus, the first derivative of a point is not its position in space, but its propensity to change its position; not where an object is, but how it moves in space and time. This shared quality, unfathomable to some, and yet self-evident to a four-year-old, was the lasting link between my mother and her twin. Tulu and Bulu were no longer recognizably identical  but they shared the first derivative of identity.

	<text>'Sexy chick' roles, pay disparities, discrimination against female directors... sexism runs deep in Hollywood. A non-profit production company, We Do It Together, seeks to change all that with more powerful roles for women both on and off screen. As a member of its advisory board, Freida Pinto is at the Cannes Film Festival to announce its first project. The actor tells Sumeet Keswani about the stereotypes she has encountered and how she fought them At a time when feminism has percolated to the grassroots, how has sexism sustained itself in the upper echelons of Hollywood? Art imitates life. And if you look at the world around, there's a very strong element of sexism ingrained among people, even the most educated groups. I was watching this TED talk on infidelity by Esther Perel and it was very interesting to learn how sexism was actually glorified eons ago. I don't want to sound like a cynic but it would be too high an expectation to think it can disappear suddenly. But it's definitely time to do something about it, to at least curtail the impact of it on women. How will the non-profit address sexism? What's the first project? Although we're a non-profit film production company, we're not here for charity. While we as individuals are not looking to make any money, the box office proceeds from each venture will feed the next. The idea is to produce something exciting and entertaining. We don't want to tell stories of puritan, chaste women, but women who are as real and powerful as men. It's not just the stories, but also who's making them. In 2002, 7% of directors were female. It's 2016 now, and that number still stands at 7%. We're looking at female-driven stories made by female directors. Our first project is going to be a compilation of six to seven short stories. Each of these is a project that a female director or producer wanted to make. These will be released together as a feature film or TV series. One of them is a story I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to be producing it and acting in it too. Have you done any roles that you now feel catered to stereotypes? I have done many roles that were stereotypical! When I started off, I would think, 'If I don't take up this offer, maybe I won't get anything else.' When I took up Day of the Falcon, I wasn't very sure about the character. When I read it on paper, I wanted to give it a stronger presence. In the end, I didn't entirely go with my gut instinct. I can't tell others what to do but I personally have now come to a place in my life where if I'm offered a role that may be construed as sexist or degrading to women, I refuse to do it. I have the responsibility and power to say no. Any roles you've refused? I was offered a stereotypical role of an Indian call centre employee who spoke in a very desi accent. It also had a very disrespectful reference to the 2012 gang rape in Delhi. I immediately threw up my hands and refused the role. Any recent female characters that you have loved? Last year, Room was one of the most phenomenal movies. It was nice to get an insight into the life of a woman who was traumatized and wasn't the perfect mother at times, and that's fine. You shouldn't make a lesser film by telling the story of a perfect woman. Cate Blanchett's character in Blue Jasmine and Alicia Vikander's in The Danish Girl were also good to see. In Bollywood, Deepika's performance in Piku was refreshing. I'm working with Richa Chadha on Love Sonia. She's done a fair amount of powerful roles. And Shefali Shah is out of this world! I loved Kangana in Queen; she was vulnerable, funny and empowered all at the same time. Women aren't black and white all the time, and shouldn't be portrayed so. Actors like Cameron Diaz, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Olivia Wilde have brought up the issue of ageism in Hollywood. Your take on it? The issue very much exists. There's a disparity in the way men and women are viewed. For instance, Tom Cruise can be in his 50s and still be Ethan Hunt and romance 22-year-olds on screen. But when female actors hit 35 or 37, or god forbid the 40-mark, they are relegated to playing mothers or grandmothers  older characters who aren't sexually active anymore... all the female body parts suddenly disappear! We're still here, the same people having the same kind of fun men like to have. Female actors seem to have a shelf life in the industry. I personally feel that in my 30s, I'm more aware of who I am than I was in my 20s. Doesn't it mean I should get better roles now? But that's not the case. We want to address this issue by coming up with amazing stories of women well into their 40s, 50s, and 60s. They can be very entertaining as well. Has the issue of whitewashing affected you? Does your ethnicity dictate roles? From the very onset of my career, my team pushed out the message, 'Yes, she's Indian, but she's not interested in playing Indian roles only, especially not the stereotypical ones.' So I haven't faced that issue. As far as whitewashing goes, TV is way ahead of films in diversity. There's also a problem with the way Asian actors are cast. Filmmakers shouldn't add a token Indian girl for the sake of diversity; give her something real to do.</text>

	<text>They were once boys from the 'naka' rapping about their city from its chawls and gullies. Now, Divine and Naezy are stars with their songs about politics and poverty making waves at home and abroad Divine aka Vivian Fernandes once played 'fillers' at college shows. Today, besides a major label contract, he has a viral video Jungli Sher with over a million views, and packed shows in London. The 25-year-old, who still lives in the slums of Andheri's JB Nagar, also made history as the first Indian rapper  he rapped freestyle in Hindi  for BBC 1 radio show host and rapper Charlie Sloth's iconic 'Fire in the Booth' series. Then there's Naved Sheikh, who at 13, was transformed by Sean Paul's Temperature when he first heard it spun by a DJ in his Kurla chawl. He went to a cybercafe the next day, printed out the lyrics and memorised them. In 2014 as a 22-year-old, Naved's alter-ego Naezy unleashed his frustration in a DIY video  Aafat  that was shot on zero budget on an iPad. Aafat has since racked up more than 4.7 lakh views on YouTube. It made Naezy the subject of the documentary Bombay 70 and got him a deal from Only Much Louder, India's biggest alternative culture promoter and management agency. His latest video, Haq Hai, has ratcheted over 30,000 views in just over a week. These two rappers and their rap-to-riches stories are also the inspiration for Zoya Akhtar's next project, Gully Boy that (if whispers) are to be believed, will feature Ranveer Singh as a rapper. It will have Naezy collaborate on lyrics with poet and lyricist Gulzar. Nothing confirms the entry of a subculture into the mainstream like a big Bollywood production. But how did these two young men, who rap in Bombaiya, tapori style, catch the nation's ears? The slums and chawls of Mumbai have always been a fertile ground for bhasha (language) rap, a style adapted from American rap but Indianised, that found a willing community online. But Naezy and Divine  who collaborated on the 2015 hit, Mere gully mein  told an authentic and original story that people have identified with all over the country. File photo of Naezy. "Mere gully mein represented the emergence of real, Indian hip-hop. It echoed the same story that gave birth to hip-hop in New York  the story of the streets," says Tej Brar, a self-confessed hip-hop fiend and head of talent at OML. Indians are familiar with rap and hip-hop. Songs like 50 Cents' It's ma birthday and Eminem's Slim Shady have been played on rotation in every coffee shop, club and birthday party while the current crop of Punjabi rappers have ensured that everyone can lip sync to at least one song about daaru, dope-shope and brown rang girls. But Mere gully mein is different. The new-age desi rappers talk about corruption, lackadaisical governments, police brutality, family apathy, militancy and any issue that pushes them to speak out. (Divine compares Mumbai's citizenry to a herd of goats ready to be slaughtered by butcher-politicians). Quite a change from the kind of superficial, materialistic, aspirational hip-hop that surrounds us today. "Delhi had a bustling Punjabi rap/hip-hop scene. But they made songs about cars, alcohol, girls. We rapped about our gully, our city. It was genuine, authentic Indian hip-hop," says Divine, on a high after performing at the first-ever BBC Asian Network Festival at Eventim Apollo in London, which also featured popular singers like Kanika Kapoor and Badshah. By speaking in a language that everyone from a roadside hawker to a rickshaw guy to a businessman would understand, and issues that affect everyone, these rappers became a window into the reality that is contemporary India. "Hip-hop is modern-day protest music. Cleverly, through rhyme, you can speak your mind. That's the universal appeal. And the environment is ripe for it," says Cyrus Oshidar, managing director and creative director at 101india.com, a youth content portal that recently released a 12-part hip-hop documentary series called Hip-Hop Homeland. The series will next document the hip-hop scenes in Punjab and Shillong. Naezy, who recently released a song called Haq Hai, believes that hip-hop can be a game-changer. "Hip-hop ek aisa zariya hai jo hamare desh main bhi badlav la sakta hai (hip-hop is a way to bring about a change in our country). The masses think that hip-hop is about daaru, nasha, bling and swag but if you really look at hip-hop's antecedents, it was used to bring about a revolution. I want to remove people's misconceptions and rewrite the history of Indian hip-hop," Naezy declares quite ambitiously. Whether or not hip-hop brings about social change, the music industry is banking on its star, Divine, to rope in more talent and audiences. Sony Music India, which has signed on Divine, is confident that hip-hop is a key space in India. "Rapping and hip-hop both have picked up considerably here over the last couple of years. Rappers like Bohemia founded the genre in India, Divine, on the other hand, is slowly taking raw and real rap to the mainstream audiences. We will be signing more talent soon," says Rohan Jha, lead pop music, Sony Music India. Brar says it like it is: "2016 is the year of desi hip-hop." Divine: 25 (aka Vivian Fernandes) Chart-topper: Jungli Sher Performed at the inaugural BBC Asian Network Festival, London His video Jungli Sher scored 1 million views on YouTube Raps in Bambaiya Naezy: 24 (aka Naved Sheikh) Chart-topper: Aafat His video Aafat racked up over 4.7 lakh views on YouTube Will collaborate with lyricist Gulzar on Zoya Akhtar's hip-hop film Gully Boy Raps in Hindi and Urdu</text>

	<text>Movies to Mahabharata, he's analysed them all S Anand's passion for computing drove his Chemical Engineering professors to distraction at IIT Madras, and when he moved on to IIM Bangalore, after a brief stint at IBM India, he was nicknamed "Stud" and alternatively, "Prof"  which as any alumnus will tell you  is one of the highest forms of praise that can be given to a batchmate. After graduating from IIM B, Anand moved on to jobs at the Boston Consulting Group and Infosys Consulting. In 2012, he was infected by the startup virus, and became chief data scientist at Gramener, which specializes in data visualization. Anand lives in Bangalore, where he uses text analytics to uncover the fact that it is Yudhishthira who is at the centre of Mahabaratha's plot, and not Arjuna, as one would imagine. Oh, and he also uses data science to understand his mobile bill. On becoming a data scientist ... It was an accidental mix of three of my personal interests  programming, statistics and design. It wasn't until 2009 that the term "data science" was coined. Until then, I knew I wanted a career that combined all three of my passions. Once I knew it had a name, the decision was obvious. What's the kind of work you do at Gramener? We're short circuiting the gap between gathering data and understanding data. We're work with all kinds of data. We work with aircraft flight paths, call data, court case results, fielding performances, poll forecasts, TV serial transcripts, even sex survey responses. But across these domains and types of data, there are common patterns of problems. Which are the biggest problem areas? What factors drive performance? What is the expected outcome? Fortunately, we have also discovered common patterns of analysis and visuals that answer these. Our work involves applying these patterns to any and every dataset. (File photo of Raam Nayakar) Best thing about your job ... Stumbling on strange patterns that tell a story. For example, when we discovered that 88 people at Modakkuruchi, TN, stood for elections but didn't even vote for themselves, it was a shock. Or when we found that children born in August score much more than children born in July. Or that people taking meter readings don't always visit the premises and cook up numbers that are typically multiples of 10. There are usually several insights hidden in data. For us, it's like exploring Alibaba's cave of treasures. What tools do you use? We use Python (a programming language) for most of our analysis. It's easy to learn, and easy to explore data with. R and Julia are quite popular as well. But Excel remains the primary method for data exploration in most organisations, and is quite effective. However, the tool is often less important than the scientist. A good scientist with a paper and pen will beat a moderate scientist with the best tool available today. How do you use data in daily life? Several of my day-to-day decisions are data-driven. What to eat? I scrape price and calorie information to pick cheap energy-rich foods. What to watch? I visualise the top-rated popular movies by genre from IMDb. When to book a flight? I review flight price trends, and typically book exactly 8 days before the flight. In many ways, my becoming a data scientist was driven by these inclinations. It's not because I'm a data scientist that I do this. It's because I have always done this that I'm a data scientist today. (As told to Narayanan Krishnaswami) Numbers have a story to tell Somewhat like endurance biking, data science is about staying power and enjoying the ride. Little wonder that Raam Nayakar, who is senior manager of marketing analytics and strategy at fashion e-retailer Myntra, follows one as a passion and the other as a profession. Sometimes the twain do meet when the 37-year-old uses his data orientation to find petrol stations and eating joints on remote biking routes. Best thing about the job It's a dynamic field. Finding new ways to analyse data keeps me on my toes. For instance, I recently learnt Python, an open-source analysis system in demand these days. Data analysis sometimes results in counter-intuitive insights, which is very exciting for us. For example, we once told an American wholesale retailer's credit card program to invert their loyalty rewards system and reward low spenders instead of the higher ones. We had identified the highest spenders as mostly re-sellers who did not need to be incentivized. This saved the company millions of dollars. What makes a good data scientist? A data scientist has to have a business context. We should be able to look at numbers, understand what they are telling us, and how that message can be converted into an actionable form. A good data scientist needs to have an eye for detail as well as the big picture. A typical day at work One day I am trying to find which TV channels drive better traffic for Myntra; another day I am engaged in text mining to rank social media responses for a contest we ran. It's the diversity of business problems that keeps my work interesting. Applying data science in daily life When I came back to Bangalore after a few years of living abroad, I was overwhelmed by the traffic. It would take me an hour and fifteen minutes to reach the Hosur Road office from my residence in JP Nagar. In the first month, I tried multiple routes at different timings, assessed areas of traffic congestion, and road conditions. In other words, I analysed the traffic data to construct a route that now takes me less than 45 minutes. Being a data oriented person, I don't miss out on details. My skills help me optimize time and effort even when I am not working. For example, if you want to get good properties to stay during your trips abroad  find out from which country do most of the tourists come from. Then make your booking from a local travel site in that country. I got two nights in a private villa in Bali when I booked from an Australian tour agent site. At the time, Australia contributed over 25% of tourists to Bali. Now, China has overtaken Australia. Is it going to stay a hot job? Many startups are now offering data science incubators and boot camps to train an army of data miners. Business analytics training institutes are offering courses, as are some of the IIMs. Big data is going to get even bigger. (As told to Shobita Dhar)</text>

	<text>Even as India's first PM is scrubbed out from textbooks, his reputation is being savaged on the internet * Jawahar, the Arabic word for pearl, could not have been chosen by any Kashmiri Brahmin as a name for his child. * Jawaharlal Nehru's grandfather was Ghiasuddin Ghazi, a kotwal of the Mughals, who changed his name to Gangadhar Nehru. * Nehru was born in a brothel in Allahabad. * Nehru got a Catholic nun pregnant, and was indebted to the church for spiriting her away from India. He died of syphilis. * Amitabh Bachchan is his son. Welcome to the virtual world of Nehru vilification. Entirely unhinged from reality, these wild stories about India's first prime minister, who laid the foundations of its democracy, are nonetheless the default on the internet. Unlike the academic challenge of changing details in textbooks, the Web is a terrain for the taking. "Anything that questions dominant historical views is going to find visibility and virality online," says digital media scholar Nishant Shah. Crackpot stories about Nehru have circulated for decades - for instance, former RSS chief K S Sudarshan has claimed that Nehru killed Gandhi. But "these are voices that never made it to the mainstream. Now, because there is such a preponderance of them online, these rumours take on a life of their own," says Rohit Chopra, media studies professor at Santa Clara University, who works on online Hindutva. This is particularly problematic because for many people now, reality is what they can find through Google, he says. Nehru, of course, is highest on the list of hate objects for Hindutva extremists. "After Partition, and even more after Gandhi's murder, Nehru was convinced that India must not in any circumstances become a Hindu Pakistan. He saw the RSS as dangerous because of its demonising of minorities, and repeatedly and publicly attacked it," says historian Ramachandra Guha. And the RSS continues to attack him right back. The hegemony of his ideas, and the persistence of his bloodline are both intolerable to them. "Indira's, Rajiv's, Sanjay's, Sonia's and Rahul's mistakes (real or imagined) are retrospectively attached to Nehru," says Guha. On YouTube, a search for Nehru throws up smear after smear. The first, declaring him "Hindustan ka sabse ayyash aadmi", was watched 40,16,640 times at last count. These stories lay bare the campaign against him  Nehru must be cast as Muslim, westernised and dissolute, to discredit him. To establish him as a philanderer, there is a patchwork of images of Nehru at innocuous moments, with Jacqueline Kennedy and Mrinalini Sarabhai, embracing his sister at the airport, lighting a woman's cigarette. Last year, Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Centre for Internet and Society, caught sneaky edits to the Wikipedia entries of Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru, emanating from a central government IP address. Recently, a patently fake and misspelt "historical" letter did the rounds, where Nehru supposedly described Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal. The right wing has mastered the arts of seeding misinformation, says Shah. Their claims do not come from one author, but from many different users, each adding layers to the rumours. Then, he says, "It is a matter of faith through repetition, rather than truth through inquiry". While such conspiracy theories sprout all around the world, in India, they dominate search results, says Prakash. Apart from forums that rationally disagree with Nehruvian economics, foreign policy or defence, or make credible assertions about his positions, there are voices that simply slander Nehru. "Many kinds of right-wing animosities, economic, cultural and those that are reacting to the actions of the Nehru Gandhi family, come together in this attack," observes Prakash. These ideas have also taken root, to some extent. A startup employee unconnected to any political party recently set up a Twitter handle called Nehruvian, trying to counter such propaganda. He explains why he was stirred into action - "On a train to Lucknow, I was reading The Discovery of India, when a young man in his twenties asked me, "kyon padh rahe ho is chor ki kitaab?" And yet, there is no way to counter motivated rumours, short of undesirable censorship. Propaganda is a legitimate activity, and any rebuttal is also likely to be confined to its own echo chamber, Shah points out. Rather, what is needed is a new digital literacy, the "capacity to sift trustworthy information, to look critically at the sources they come from", says Prakash. As for Nehru, it may not be easy for textbook warriors of keyboard guerrillas to dislodge him. If after 52 years, there's still so much panic about his legacy, there must be something very durable about it."</text>

	<Heading>Designer babies: Where should India draw the line on gene editing?</Heading>

	<text>We need a national conversation before we think about changing the genetic material of our children, writes oncologist and author of 'The Gene', Siddhartha Mukherjee A few years ago, scientists developed powerful technologies to "edit" the genomes of human cells. There are two words in that sentence that deserve explanation  and that matter greatly for India. The "genome" is the entire repository of genetic material that is needed to build, repair and maintain humans. It contains about 3 billion letters of DNA  A,C,T and G  strung together in a rather inscrutable sequence (ACTGGGTTT... and so forth). It might be likened to an encyclopedia of our genetic material  all the genes in all our cells, the additional sequences of DNA that tell our bodies when and where to deploy these genes, and stretches that have no known function. Indeed, if it was printed as an encyclopedia, it would encompass 66 full sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Until recently, "editing" the human genome (or any genome, for that matter) was thought to be impossible  that is, scientists generally agreed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to change the code written into the encyclopedia in an intentional manner. All of this changed in 2012, when a team of biologists discovered a trick by which the human genome can be altered in a rather simple manner. To return to our analogy, this would be like picking one book from the massive library of encyclopedias, changing a single word in that book, and leaving the rest of the code untouched. We still don't know the safety or fidelity of this method  perhaps other words in the code are unintentionally changed  but it is a more powerful method of intervening on the genome than we have encountered in the history of science. This technique has been called "gene editing". What does this mean, and why is it important? On one hand, the capacity to change the human genome in an intentional manner opens up powerful new therapeutic capabilities. Medical scientists can imagine using this technology for gene therapy in human lungs or blood cells  correcting the genetic abnormality that causes sickle cell anaemia, for instance, or other devastating human diseases. But is there also the possibility that these tools will be used to enhance height, or intelligence? What if scientists used these technologies to change the genetic material of human embryos  thereby permanently changing the human gene pool? These questions were raging urgently throughout the scientific world when a disruptive experiment was published. In the spring of 2015, a laboratory in China announced that it had attempted to "edit" the genomes of human embryos. At the Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, a team led by Junjiu Huang obtained 86 human embryos from an IVF clinic and tried to use "gene editing" to correct a gene responsible for a common blood disorder (only embryos that were non-viable in the long term were chosen). Seventy-one embryos survived. Of the 54 embryos tested, only four were found to have the corrected gene inserted. Rage and anguish broke out through the scientific world in response to the experiment in China. In the US, genetic intervention on a human embryo is barricaded through strict laws  and this arena is especially scrutinized as biologists continue to explore gene-editing technologies. Chinese commentators, however, were more sanguine about the use of such technologies. When the prospect of an international moratorium on gene editing in human embryos was suggested, one scientist wrote: "I don't think China wants to take a moratorium." A Chinese bioethicist clarified, "Confucian thinking says someone becomes a person after they are born. That is different from the US and other countries with a Christian influence, where because of religion they may feel research on embryos is not okay". Where might India fit in this bioethical spectrum? At least this much is clear: a response is necessary, because the tools to modify human embryos are becoming simpler, more accurate, and widely available around the world. With burgeoning biotechnological capabilities, scientists in India could potentially perform experiments similar to the ones performed in China, or other experiments that might lead to gene editing in human embryos. In 2001, as described in the British Medical Journal, a national bioethics panel in India "said that scientists may harvest human embryos for research before day 14 of gestation with the informed consent of the donor. All projects would have to be approved by the national bioethics panel, and researchers would have to share any commercial benefits that emerge from embryonic stem cell lines with the donor." The Indian Council for Medical Research, and other bioethics panels in the country are performing an admirable task of re-evaluating these guidelines in the light of new gene editing technologies. But this needs to be a national and public conversation. What moral precepts should guide us as we think about changing the genetic material of our children? Where does our culture, or history, force us to draw strong lines? The context is especially important, because the desire for genetic intervention exists in this country. In parts of India, crude technologies of genetic diagnosis through amniocentesis (and other methods) have reportedly resulted in the selective abortion of female foetuses. The impact of genetic diagnosis remains unclear, but the overall skew in the gender ratio in parts of India is striking: about 850 females to every 1,000 males in Punjab and Haryana. The shift towards male children in these states may underscore a more general aspiration to use interventions  genetic or otherwise  to produce more "desirable" children. Should the bioethics panels require the consensus of such citizens in drafting a policy on genetic intervention on human embryos? These questions will only be amplified in intensity as we move towards the future. For now, as we consider the wider implications of gene editing in India, it might be advisable to use three guiding principles for the future. l First, genetic interventions should only be used to alleviate extraordinary suffering  that is, their role should be restricted to diseases that devastate human beings. l Second: these interventions should be used on genes that are clearly implicated in diseases, and not genes where the link to the illness is weak or speculative (and certainly not used to tamper with genes that purportedly influence height or intelligence, about which we know very little). l And third, and most important: the interventions should not be carried out without state mandate or state supervision. These principles might be imagined as a "safe triangle" within which genetic interventions on humans may still be performed  while the Indian public considers future policies in this arena. Until a time that a consensus is reached, Indian scientists might also wish to join the proposed international moratorium on gene editing on human embryos. BLURB: The desire for genetic intervention exists in India. In some parts, crude technologies of genetic diagnosis have resulted in selective abortion of female foetuses. The shift towards male children may underscore a more general aspiration to use interventions to produce more 'desirable' children.</text>

	<text>l Jan 21, 2015: Gangster Sukha Kahlon is gunned down in Phagwara by a rival gang. The killers dance around his bloodied body, shoot a video and post it online. On the Facebook page of Kahlon, who was facing 40 criminal cases, RIP messages pour in and many swear revenge. l Feb 20, 2016: Ravi Khwajke, a sarpanch, is shot dead at a marriage function in Ludhiana. Notorious hitman Davinder Bambiha takes 'credit' for the murder on his FB page, gets over 500 'likes'. l April 30, 2016: Gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky is shot dead near Parwanoo in Himachal triggering an online war among criminals to hog credit. Welcome to the ganglands of Punjab where rival gangsters are not only bumping off each other on the streets but also boasting about their crimes on social media while projecting themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods. Many of these bandolier-sporting and gun-toting gangsters call themselves 'Lions of Punjab'; some have pictures of Khalistani icon Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as their FB cover photo. For them, a murder is not complete until they take responsibility for it online for all to know and 'like'. Last month when gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky, who faced multiple criminal cases and had contested the 2012 Punjab assembly elections from Fazilka and almost won, was slain near Parwanoo, it sparked off hectic online activity among criminals. A day later, gangster Jai Pal, an ex-cop's son from Ferozepur who is on the run, posted that he was the one who had actually killed Rocky, a claim the cops are taking seriously given his crime record. The same day friends and followers of Rocky created 'RIP Jaswinder Singh Rocky'  thousands posted messages on the page, calling Rocky a 'legendary man' and swearing revenge. Many of the gang-related murders in the last four years were instigated on Facebook  the killers boasted about their deed and humiliated rivals by posting messages on the pages of their victims. The hate messages are not removed by gangs and continue to feed their hatred for years. The celebratory video clip made by Kahlon's killers went viral last year. Even those in high-security jails across Punjab have been updating their FB accounts, taking credit for various crimes. But prison officials insist these are being operated by their supporters outside. ADGP (Prisons) M K Tiwari says, "We raided three jails after the killing of gangster Rocky but did not recover any SIM or phone, including in Nabha Jail, where gangster Vicky Gounder, who claimed responsibility for Rocky's killing, is lodged." Rajesh Gill, professor of sociology at Panjab University, says it's a worrying trend. "Some youngsters continue to eulogize militancy and believe that guns and violence are the easiest and shortest way to fame. This is also reflected in popular Punjabi songs, which are all about guns and killings," he says. Incidentally, the Punjabi Sahit Akademi had recently passed a resolution against Punjabi songs that glorify gun culture, saying such songs brainwash youngsters into believing there is pride and glory in crime. Gangsters also post messages of courage and fearlessness on their pages, portraying themselves as brave do-gooders on the wrong side of the law. Jitender Mohan, professor emeritus of psychology, Panjab University, says 'showing off' and bragging are part of Punjabi culture. "These gangsters are also desperate attention seekers and have found that the easiest way to fame, rather infamy, is through guns and false bravado," says Mohan. Is there no stopping them? According to IGP (cyber crime) P K Sinha, the cyber cell has been tracking the activities of gangsters online and action will be taken soon. "We are in the process of approaching Facebook headquarters in California through MHA to request them to disable some of the accounts. We are also exploring legal ways under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which authorizes law enforcement agencies to act against people using the internet against the sovereignty of the state," he adds. In the meantime, the gangs seem to be plotting their next hit. A day after Rocky's murder in Himachal, gangster Jaipal sent a chilling warning to rival gangs and cops in a message on FB: "The game has just begun. Just Wait and Watch." (With inputs from Vaivasvat Venkat in Ludhiana) Online lives of dead gangsters Shera Khuban: Headed the Gounder gang and was killed by Punjab police in Sept 2012, allegedly on a tipoff from Rocky's gang members. His FB account continues to be operational and posts are updated regularly. The FB page of Gounder gang has over 5,000 likes and members post important and frequent updates here Happy Deora: A close pal of gangster Jai Pal and later Rocky, Happy was killed allegedly by Shera Khuban in July 2012. RIP messages still continue to pour in on his FB page Sukha Kahlon: Nicknamed himself 'Sharpshooter', had over 10 FB pages, some of them by his fans, and many continue to be operational. After his murder, his FB page had issued warnings to two Punjab cops. One of his FB pages introduces him as "25 pindaaaa ch charcha... Jatt te 302 da parcha... (Most talked about in 25 villages...This Jat has a murder case against him) Lovely Baba: Part of the Gounder gang, he was killed, allegedly by gangster Sukha Kahlon in 2014. Friends and fans continue to 'miss' him on his FB page</text>

	<Heading>10 home remedies to avoid swine flu</Heading>

	<text>Are the rising swine flu casualties giving you jitters? Not sure how you can avoid falling prey to the growing epidemic? First and foremost, there is absolutely no need to panic. Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind, including swine flu. It is not necessary to follow all the steps at once. You can pick and choose a combination of remedies that suit you best. However, if you are already suffering from flu, these measures can help only up to an extent. 1. Have five duly washed leaves of Tulsi (known as Basil in English; medicinal name Ocimum sanctum) everyday in the morning. Tulsi has a large number of therapeutic properties. It keeps throat and lungs clear and helps in infections by way of strengthening your immunity. 2. Giloi (medicinal name Tinospora cordifolia) is a commonly available plant in many areas. Take a one-foot long branch of giloi, add five to six leaves of Tulsi and boil in water for 15-20 minutes or long enough to allow the water to extract its properties. Add black pepper and sendha (salt used during religious fasts), rock or black salt, or Misri (crystalised sugar like lumps to make it sweet) according to taste. Let it cool a bit and drink this kadha (concoction) while still warm. It will work wonders for your immunity. If giloi plant is not available, get processed giloi powder from Hamdard or others, and concoct a similar drink once a day. 3. A small piece of camphor (kapoor) approximately the size of a tablet should be taken once or twice a month. It can be swallowed with water by adults while children can take it along with mashed potatoes or banana because they will find it difficult to have it without any aides. Please remember camphor is not to be taken everyday, but only once each season, or once a month. 4. Those who can take garlic, must have two pods of raw garlic first thing in the morning. To be swallowed daily with lukewarm water. Garlic too strengthens immunity like the earlier measures mentioned. 5. Those not allergic to milk, must take a glass of hot or lukewarm milk every night with a small measure of haldi (turmeric). 6. Aloe vera (gwarpatha) too is a commonly available plant. Its thick and long, cactus-like leaves have an odourless gel. A teaspoon gel taken with water daily can work wonders for not only your skin and joint pains, but also boost immunity. 7. Take homeopathic medicines  Pyrogenium 200 and Inflenzium 200 in particular  five tablets three times a day, or two-three drops three times a day. While these are not specifically targeted at H1N1 either, these work well as preventive against common flu virus. 8. Do Pranayam daily (preferably under guidance if you are already not initiated into it) and go for morning jog/walk regularly to keep your throat and lungs in good condition and body in fine fettle. Even in small measures, it will work wonders for your body's resistance against all such diseases which attack the nose, throat and lungs, besides keeping you fit. 9. Have citrus fruits, particularly Vitamin C rich Amla (Indian gooseberry) juice. Since fresh Amla is not yet available in the market (not for another three to four months), it is not a bad idea to buy packaged Amla juice which is commonly available nowadays. 10. Last but not the least, wash your hands frequently every day with soap and warm water for 15-20 seconds; especially before meals, or each time after touching a surface that you suspect could be contaminated with flu virus such as a door handle or a knob/handle, especially if you have returned from a public place or used public transport. Alcohol-based hand cleaners should be kept handy at all times and used until you can get soap and warm water.

	<text>NEW YORK: Are you prone to asthma? Then avoid synthetic bedding, for a new study has claimed that it can aggravate asthma more than feather products as it contains high levels of fungal cells. An international team has found that synthetic bedding contains much higher levels of fungi related beta glucan than feather bedding, which are non-allergenic components from the cell walls of fungi that can account for up to 60 per cent of the weight of the cell. "This study adds further strong evidence that feather bedding is better than synthetics if you have asthma. This is because beta glucan is pro-inflammatory and associated with lung function changes including peak flow variability in kids. "There have already been a number of international studies that show synthetic bedding is associated with more asthma symptoms compared to feather bedding," lead researcher Rob Siebers of Otago University said. For their study, the researchers looked at 178 samples obtained from 35 floors, 35 mattresses, 35 duvets, 73 pillows. The total beta glucan levels of synthetic pillows were two to three times higher than from feather pillows.</text>

	<image>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-4881843,width-400,resizemode-4/4881843.jpg</image>
	<text>NEW DELHI: With an aim to launch vaccine for Influenza H1N1 A Virus (swine flu) in India, Cadila Pharmaceutical will seek the government's nod in two days for initiating clinical trials in this regard. Cadila Pharmaceutical Ltd (CPL) had set up a joint venture 'CPL Biologicals Pvt Ltd' with the US-based vaccine maker Novavax for manufacturing and developing a host of vaccines, including for swine flu, in India. "The joint venture is going to file the application with the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in the next two days for phase-I clinical trials for swine flu vaccine," CPL Chairman and Managing Director I A Modi said. Modi expressed confidence that Cadila would be the first Indian pharma company to launch the swine flu vaccine in India by December. "If we get the permission of DCGI soon, then with the advanced technology available from our partner, (we) would be able to launch it in India by December this year," Modi said. With its existing facility, Cipla can produce up to one million doses of the vaccine per month, which can be scaled up to two million doses, Modi said. "Novavax has already received permission for clinical trials from the US Federal Drug Administration and if we get it soon, we can simultaneously start the trials," he added. The government has already indicated that swine flu related applications it would clear on a fast track basis and the company is hopeful of getting instant approval for it, Modi added. He said to protect from swine flu pandemic, two dosages of the vaccine are required over two weeks. The JV has already started building a facility with an estimated investment of Rs 100 crore. In the joint venture Cadila has 80 per cent stake and the remaining 20 per cent is held by Novavax. Besides this, Cadila Pharma also holds 5.75 per cent stake in Novavax Inc US and has a position on the board of directors of the US-based company.</text>

	<Heading>Breast cancer cases surge as cervical dips</Heading>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The good news: fewer women in India now suffer from cervical cancer - counted among the worst of killers. The bad news: breast cancer cases have shot up alarmingly, across the country. A landmark analysis of cancer cases in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore between 1982-2005 (24 years) by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that while cervical cancer cases dipped, in some cases by almost 50%, the incidence of breast cancer doubled. And, the trends contained in ICMR's yet-to-be-released report `Time Trends in Cancer Incidence Rates (1982-2005)', were universal in all four cities. In case of cervical cancer, this is how the cases have dropped: In 1982, Bangalore reported 32.4 new cases of cervical cancer in women per 100,000 population every year. The number dipped to 27.2 in 1991, 17 in 2001 and 18.2 in 2005. Delhi, whose records are available from 1988, saw 25.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population the same year. It then dipped to 19.1 in 1998 and then to 18.9 in 2005. Mumbai, which recorded 17.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population in 1982, recorded 12.7 new cases in 2005. Chennai recorded a fall of almost 50% in cases of cervical cancer in this period of 24 years. In 1982, Chennai recorded 41 cases per 100,000 population; nearly a decade later, in 1991, Chennai's figure of new cases dipped to 33.4. In 2005, new cases fell further to 22 per 100,000 population. Caused by the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), cervical cancer is often called the poor woman's disease. It was earlier believed that cervical cancer was most common in India, with more than 1.3 lakh new cases reported each year and 74,000 women dying annually from the disease. While Bangalore saw breast cancer cases more than double since 1982 - 15.8 in a population of one lakh in 1982 to 32.2 in 2005 - Chennai recorded 33.5 new cases of breast cancer in 2005 against 18.4 in 1982. Delhi recorded 24.8 new cases of breast cancer a year per 100,000 women which rose to 32.2 in 2005. Mumbai recorded 20.8 new cases of breast cancer per 100,000 population in 1982 which increased by almost 10% in 2005. ICMR director general and secretary of the department of health research Dr V M Katoch told TOI, ``The decline in cases of cancer cervix has been seen across all cancer registries. Factors like late age of marriage and fewer children could be responsible for the decline.'' Chief of medical oncology at AIIMS and head of the Delhi Cancer Registry Dr Vinod Raina told TOI, ``Increasing number of women are now delivering in institutions which has greatly improved their personal hygiene. Women now marry late and give birth to fewer children, all of which have led to a dip in cervical cancer cases.'' Ironically, these are the same factors, according to Dr Raina, which has increased breast cancer rates in India. ``Western lifestyle, increased consumption of fat products, obesity, late marriages, delayed child bearing and less number of children being conceived leading to reduced breastfeeding and use of some contraceptives, are all believed to be behind this increased risk of breast cancer. This cancer is also inevitable with an ageing population,'' he added. Dr Raina, however, was quick to say that breast cancer rate in India was much less than that in the West which records around 100 new cases per 100,000 population every year. According to Dr Katoch, the report depicts changes in the incidence rates of cancer and is the first for any chronic disease in India. Certain anatomical sites of cancer have shown a significantly steady increase across all registries, breast cancer being one of them. ``This data will now help galvanize India's health system and tell us how we can improve diagnostic capabilities and specialists in some types of cancer affecting Indians most,'' Dr Katoch said.</text>

	<text>Alexandre de Juniac, chairman and CEO of Air France-KLM, which on June 24 launched a 500 million aircraft upgrade project called BEST AND BEYOND with the inaugural flight of an advanced Boeing 777 on the Paris-New York route, says flyers from India can look forward to top-of-the-line seats by the end of 2016. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI's Surendra Singh: India being one of the largest economies in Asia, what are the new services Air France-KLM is planning to start in the country? Air France-KLM operates 20 weekly flights from India to Paris and 14 weekly flights from India to Amsterdam. We will launch upgraded B777 with top-class seats both for the business and economy classes in India by 2016. Our A330 fleet, which majorly caters to India, will also be upgraded by the end of 2016. Will you extend your business class promotional fares for Europe/UK tours for Indian flyers. Are you going to come up with more such attractive offers? Yes, we will. We will certainly come up with new offers. By the way, we are the only airline in the world to provide free champagne to our customers in all classes. Like the code share pact with Jet Airways, is AF-KLM planning any such partnership with domestic carriers? No plan at the moment. However, the code sharing pact with Jet Airways enabling flyers of both airlines seamless travel across destinations is working very well. Alexandre de Juniac. Will you elaborate on La Premiere segment? When are you going to launch the luxury cabins in Asia, particularly in India? La Premiere, ultra modern cabin with 4 suites in Boeing 777, will provide flyers home comfort in the air. A fully flatted bed, 24-inch high definition TV screen, personal wardrobe, hi-tech entertainment system and cabin with curtains will provide flyers a feel of 'cocoon in the sky'. Top-of-the-line cutlery, woven fabrics, cushions, adjustable curtains have been given a French touch. Flyers will get an escort to and from plane. Initially, 19 Boeing 777s are being equipped with La Premiere and the first aircraft will be launched on the Shanghai route in September. If the demand for the La Premiere increases, we will launch the product in India. Is it justified for AF-KLM Martinair Cargo to drop Delhi, the national capital, as a destination for full freighter operations? We have shrunk full freighter operations as our passenger aircraft are carrying 80% of the cargo load in their belly. Moreover, our new aircraft are coming with bigger bellies and can take extra load. It's cost-effective. How seriously are you taking competition with Gulf and Chinese carriers? Gulf carriers are eating into the Indian aviation market. The upgrade plan is to provide top-class product to our customers and give a tough competition to Gulf airlines. At the same time, we have an agreement with Etihad in order to understand and capture the market in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Seychelles. What target have you set for annual passenger capacity? Our annual passenger capacity is nearly 80 million. We haven't set our target but with better service and upgrade, we expect our annual passenger capacity will only grow. Why have you changed the slogan from 'Making the sky the best place on earth' to 'Air France, France in the air'. We want our customers to get a feel of France in the air. Service with a French touch. Air France-KLM is undergoing transformation. By 2017, we plan to invest 1 billion in our fleet in order to become a global player.

	<text>The Centre will push for key reforms including the provision of incentivising civic agencies for good work &amp; making officials concerned accountable for illegal construction or unauthorized development under their jurisdiction. In an interview to TOI's Dipak Kumar Dash, urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu said civic bodies agencies that fail to implement the master plan provisions won't get financial help from the ministry. Excerpts: The government plans to develop 100 new cities and UD ministry going to circulate a Cabinet note. What are the focus areas? We never said new cities, but 100 smart cities. Now the issue is whether you make the present cities smart or set up new cities or take up satellite cities and convert them or join two small towns and make it a city and provide them all facilities. That is under discussion. I have called a meeting of all state urban development and housing ministers on July 2 and July 3. This is because states have to play bigger role. We will take their suggestions on this and other issues. You must understand that cities cannot survive without lives. What is life? Life is education, entertainment, employment and health facilities. All these should be available. Then you need to provide water, urban transport, drinking water, have solid waste management, wi-fi facilities and GIS-based planning. All these facilities will be available in the smart cities. I am willing to take help of other countries including Australia and Singapore or whether it's Japan, Dubai or UAE. One of the major problems in cities is the civic mess, which impacts quality of living, air quality and everything. How is the government planning to address this? That's part of the reform we are talking about. There has to be certain amount of accountability of civic agencies. We are trying to incentivize agencies that do good work and are taking states on the board. There is a serious problem of devolution of 3Fs - funds, functions and functionaries. The local bodies are saying that they are yet to be given power that was provisioned in the 73rd and 74th amendment of the Constitution. After doing the devolution of 3Fs, we have to provide them technical help - one by states second by centre. And then also incentivize them by means of coming out with reforms. Then it will be successful. The taxpayers are unhappy as the areas surrounding residential colonies are being encroached and big illegal colonies have come up. I have put an idea before the officials and Delhi MPs. I will put it before the state ministers too. You allow unauthorized colonies for years. One day you bring bulldozer to demolish them. Then comes councillor, MLA, minister and the number gets bigger. You are not able to do anything. To deal with this the town planner, inspector or whoever is in-charge of that area must be made accountable. If we start taking action, people will be extra cautious. That's going to be my thrust area. This will be a part of the reforms that we are planning. If you don't act to implement the Master Plan, you don't get financial help from Centre.</text>

	<text>Tulika Tripathi is the managing director of a global talents solutions company, Hudson Asia. She spoke to TOI about her first book, Alice in Corporate Land, a book on career success, and more. Excerpts: Q: There are hundreds of books on corporate culture and success. What is unique about your book, Alice in Corporate Land? A: I am a voracious reader. When reading fiction, I can put myself in the place of the main character. I really enjoy the experience. Most books on career management are written as non-fiction. They give advice to the author. This makes the reader passive. Alice in Corporate Land is in the form of a fairy tale. The reader can accompany Alice on her journey and learn lesson themselves rather than having the writer telling them what to do. As a book, it's light and entertaining. Work is also about fun and this book allows the reader to learn the career lessons while being entertained. It also uses analogies of fairy tales with which the reader can relate. Q: What inspired you to write this book based on a fairy tale? A: Strangely a mixture of a few things. A couple of years ago retelling of fairly tales became quite popular. Retold versions of Snow White and Cinderella and movies like Once Upon A Time came out. It became quite a popular genre. At the High Potential Leadership Programme at Harvard Business School last year, I read a retelling of Cinderella. While walking back from a bar with a colleague, he asked me, why I was reading that book on fairy tales. I said it made me feel young and gives a perspective that things are possible. The idea that people look at fairy tales in a limited way stuck in my mind. I also wanted to leave some kind of advice for teams I had developed over the years. The writing fell into place and grew as a piece of fiction which is actually a business book. Q: Do you believe that small changes in one's life can make a difference? A: Big changes are actually a series of small changes. Small changes have knock on effects like the ripple effects and lead to very large outcomes. Most things that have made me successful, and probably would make me successful in the future, are not the big decisions that I make but the small things that I did. Making small changes in detail give maximum results. At the moment, the bigger decision I made with my general managers is instead of thinking why I can't do it, thinking of how I can do it. It's more of thinking how I can make that change rather than wondering why I can't make that change. Q: Why did you decide to use fairy tales to bring out different skills/lessons people can learn and use? A: People can relate to them. As children, we read fairy tales. Girls read fairytale books more than boys. Fairy tales play a role in women's psyche and life like thinking of one's Prince Charming. The stories in fairly tales can be interpreted in different ways. Q: What advice would you give someone just starting a career? A: The biggest advice I would give someone starting their career especially out of B school is when you start a career you might not be doing the most interesting thing. You might find it mundane and boring but put your CEO hat on. Think like you are the CEO. How can you add value to this job you have? Try to think as how you will approach it in a different manner. For example, at my first week for my job, I had to photocopy confidential papers. I cried the first and second day. The third day, I said to myself, I am stuck in this photocopy room so let me just read the confidential documents. Through reading these documents I learned telecom communication. Remember, it's not a race but a marathon. One needs to develop all muscles to go all the way. Build your work ethic. Be proactive and volunteer for tasks. Other people always like to have people who can do their job. Q: What was your favourite fairy tale as a child? A: My favourite fairy tale as a child was Cinderella. It's a classic story. It talks about overcoming adversity and having a happy ending. This concept fascinates me. Q: Are you planning to write another book? A: I have already started another book. It's in the initial stages. I will be talking in depth about the leadership challenges that one faces. Leadership is a complicated concept. The book that I am currently working on is not really a sequel to my book, Alice in Corporate Land. I have two directions in mind on how to write this book. One will be to continue using Alice as a main character and the other using a character named Tobi.</text>

	<text>The responsibility of lighting up the country today rests on Piyush Goyal's shoulders. Just a month into his new job, the minister for power, coal and renewable energy has set an electric pace to energize the sector. He shares his vision with TOI in a freewheeling interview with Sanjay Dutta. When can we expect 24X7 power supply or blackouts in hinterland to get shorter? Clearly, customer is the king. And that has been my first message to the departments under me. My effort is that we become a far more responsive government both to the needs and problems of the customer. When I say customer, the last man on the street is the final customer. But then within the system the power generator is the customer of the coal ministry or the coal supplier. The distributor is the customer of the power producer and then likewise in the entire chain. I am trying to get that responsiveness into the system that the coal people give the best service which means quality price, timely delivery to the generator. Generator ensures timely supplies which will also include transmission and distribution, being adequately provided so the generator can satisfy his customer which is the distribution company. The distribution company focuses to reduce power theft, to make sure 100% metering is done, he gets conscious of the fact that he has to ensure 24X7 power to each consumer and ultimately the consumer has to be educated that he has to pay for that power. He has to pay for that uninterrupted power for making it uninterrupted there will be certain redundancies built into the system. Also he will have to ensure that the theft that happens in the neighbourhood is stopped by a joint effort. After all, policing alone cannot stop every problem. It's the people's movement that resolves more problems than policing. And finally, we will all in this value have to be conscious that the things are done transparently so that corruption costs are not loaded on to the final consumer and the final consumer gets quality at the right price. We cannot have a system that everything can be passed on to the final consumer in the garb of cost being recovered without being sensitive to their own problems and affordability. The PM has spoken about the need for hard decisions, given the tight economic situation. As the doctor in charge of power, coal and renewable energy ministries, what are the bitter pills you will administer? I think one of the urgent issues to address is increasing the domestic coal production so that the capacity that is available in India is put to full use. One way to recover the cost can be that you pass it on to the consumer. But I would rather focus my energies to reduce the cost by improving efficiency, improving productivity, by ensuring that every plant runs to full capacity, by ensuring that adequate coal is mined in the country so that we don't pay for expensive imported coal. I have to bring in efficiencies in terms of linkages. You will be amazed that the country has a situation where departments work in silos, so we have coal which is imported into Gujarat for a power plant in Korba, run by NTPC. And Coal India has given linkage to a power plant of the Gujarat government from Korba. The train may be crossing the line at the same time, going up and down. Rejigging this could save Rs 400-500 crore and the benefit will pass on to the consumer. It will also unclog the over burdened railway network. Help me push out more coal from the mines to its final destination. I have initiated a study at the pan-India level, my gut feeling says that thousands of crore can be saved, millions of tonnes can be additionally transported through the system, and pollution can come down. Ramifications of small decisions can be pretty large. There have been complaints that you get a lot of boulders in coal. I am trying to see what I can do; planning to get crushers (it's not an expensive proposition). I have given a timeline that by December 31, 2014 I am hoping that the Coal India board takes quick decisions and action so that every piece of coal that goes out of the Coal India mine will be to international standards. Similarly, coal washing is an environmental friendly step, which for years has been quite neglected. I have passed orders that by June 2015- June 2016, which are the deadlines set by the environment ministry for a certain level of washing to be done, it will be strictly implemented and won't seek any further extension to that. It will entail some investment and washeries, but I think there can be no better service to the nation than ensuring that we are not transporting ash over long distances. Coal India has no dearth of money ... Its sitting on a pile of Rs 60,000 crore? It's not only about having cash in the books, it's also about improving our own efficiency. I would rather put that cash to good use to open new mines, expand the mining capacity. Again, something that needs people's participation. I, on my side, can assure that whoever may get displaced whenever a new mine is opened, or a forest might have some mining activity, since mining activities are in forests, I can give categorical assurance that they will be well looked after, the R&amp;R (relief and rehabilitation) will be better than the law provides. I can assure that I will use every effort to recreate afforestation to expand the forest cover. But we will need people's support to open new mines, to mine larger quantities. Today, we have certain decisions in certain states which are holding back mining production. A particular state says that you cannot move trucks from one time to the other. And if I cannot move trucks for 14 hours in a day then the mine's production is down to 40%. So, it ultimately affects power generation and then the consumer. I will need a lot of support from all the stakeholders the states, consumers, environmentalists, everybody. I want to reach out to everyone for support. What happens to tariffs? Utilities are doddering in the absence of timely tariff revision. There are two things in this. One is what I found in a state like Rajasthan when I visited it, I suspect that the enthusiasm I see from Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, I am hopeful that these states really move fast and have come into the 24X7 category. But what I did see in Rajasthan, the state utilities increased the loss by over Rs 50,000 crore in last five years. So, it's a government which is completely agnostic to running projects efficiently and allows indiscriminate power thefts, don't bother about proper distribution network, meters are getting spoilt and are never replaced. Their revenue was only Rs 10,000 crore against an expenditure of Rs 23,000 crore last year. There's no concern for what amount is generated, or purchased, what is built, what is collected. We will have to set these things right only after consultation with the states. Centrally, I cannot interfere in states, it's a concurrent subject and in the federal polity, states are very sensitive to any 'diktats'. I will be using a lot of persuasion to reach out to different states. For me it's not about politics, I want to reach out to all states uniformly. We want 24X7 power for every citizen of India as Modi says elections are over and electioneering is over. Now it's time to perform for 125 crore citizens. We are going to reach out to the states and help them tide over these problems and incentivise good performance by states. I must tell you Gujarat, which has turned from a Rs 2,500 crore loss-making utility into a Rs 500 crore profit making utility under Modi over the last 10-12 years and giving 24X7 power to everybody, has had the lowest increase in tariffs compared to any other state in the country. I don't think it's only about tariff. They have separated their agricultural feeder, they have metered every home, and they have filed FIR's and prosecuted (people) power thefts, their collection efficiencies are among the finest. They are able to ensure that people get the power when they want at their homes, industries, commercial gets 24X7 power; agriculture gets adequate power as per their needs. It's a case study worth doing. That's what when I first visited Gujarat, I said let me learn what needs to be learnt so set other things right. It was a very educative experience. I felt very good being at Sabarmati ashram , I saw the river front and what work the govt has done there and it inspired me both , to look at it as an opportunity to give back to the society, to give back to the nation and also to see how things can be done. I mean if Mahatama Gandhi can get his freedom by spinning a charkha or Modi could clean up the water front which otherwise could have been such a sensitive subject in a communally-charged city like Ahmedabad, in a densely populated area, I think lot of things can be done, it needs little bit of leadership, sincerity of purpose and transparency and honesty. If I tell you transparently what my issues are like when the Delhi crisis came , I shared with the people what exactly my situation is and after that I found everybody cooperating very well. Are the stranded generation capacity the proverbial monkey for the government? There won't be blackouts if this capacity is brought on stream. These are actually an opportunity for the government because come to think of it, I know I have the ability to produce. I need to sort out a) its fuel supply b) transmission and finally c) distribution. Now I am very clear where exactly are the issues lying. A lot of public sector and private sector project have either come up or are on the verge of getting commissioned. They need some last-mile funding for which we've already had a meeting with the bankers and we have a small group of people , bankers and experts, who are working to see what will be the best way to provide that last mile funding but more critical issue is how to expand the output from the coal mines, how to ensure more coal goes to the power producers. The previous government had all sorts of permutations and combinations that these people will get so much coal, those will get so much; these will not be eligible, these will have to import. It's quite a complicated web we've created. My logic is simple, If a plant has come up, it is now a national asset, to waste that, keep it idle, is a national liability, national cost. Whether the banks have funded it or whosoever and if you see what all perspective, someday that cost for being stranded will be burdened on the consumers after all we are in an ecosystem wherein interest is loaded into the cost of project as interest during construction and someday it goes in the tariff calculation directly or indirectly. So my approach is that my job is to quickly get all of them operational. Get coal production to ramp up and start supplying to every operational asset and get them into production. May be, I will not be able to do 90% as I want to do right away but I will start and keep ramping it up as my production increases. So I don't think that the stranded projects are impossible to retrieve, I think I only have to increase their fuel supply on one hand and on the other I am already in dialogue with states to quickly expand the transmission so I can evacuate power all over the country and of course the last mile distribution. What about the gas-based projects? It's a much smaller dimension than the coal-based projects or thermal opportunity but in gas based also, it's a matter of approach everyone is crying about it and I am looking at it as an opportunity in the gas plants. May be, in the very long run there is a problem because gas is keeping on getting expensive and this will become pretty much unviable. But if you see from a different perspective, country has a peak load problem and gas plants can be switched on and off within 15 minutes. So they can act like a spinning reserve so I can actually use these gas plants to provide the peak loads whenever there is peaking demand, once the distribution and transmission set up is up and about. So I am hoping that a quick decision is taken by the courts where some of these gas issues are pending and we are able to see visibility in terms of the expanded gas supplies and then we will see what to do with these gas plants. Will you ask for some financial relief for the stranded projects as an interim measure? My effort is to see if I can do all of this within the framework of existing RBI guideline because I don't think it will be fair on the part, or for any one sector in the country to change established rules of the game, or law of the land for a particular set of problems we have. Having said that, it may require some small dispensations which will not completely erode the RBI's efforts to bring in more strength to the banking sector. I had a meeting with the bankers and it was a very good experience, I found them all to be very cooperative in our efforts. I think they realize that we are making very sincere efforts. I have appealed to them that they also put one foot forward also and I have assured that I will put two feet forward for every one foot that they extend. I think if all us, stakeholders, govt, banks, generating companies, distribution companies, public at large, if all of us work together, and instead of sensationalizing every issue we give the whole process a certain amount of time to stabilize and set things right, I think the problem is not impossible and the problem is not daunting. It is doable. Are you planning to open coal mining to private sector? It's not about private or public, I want to bring efficiency and better management practices in to the system, I would like to do the same things in Coal India Ltd as I would like the private sector to do if and when they do get into this sector. As regards opening up , that is up to the Cabinet to take a decision. It also depends on the Supreme Court, on the issue of mines which are under litigation because till that time I am not able to auction or open up a lot of mining. But I certainly see a lot of competition as being good for the nation, I certainly believe if more competition comes in, coal reserves can be mined faster, new technologies can be introduced. Coal India will stand to benefit from competition in terms of its own improved efficiencies, benchmarking will be better for Coal India. I had a meeting with Coal India officials -- people have always kind of held that company to be having a lot of problems -- my effort is that to take shortest possible time to bring in high standards of probity and improve their efficiency, so even a Coal India employee can hold his head high when he goes and tell somebody that he works for Coal India. Is there any proposal to restructure Coal India? There has been a lot of talk about recasting/restructuring and what not of Coal India. I have examined the reports in this regard and they have flagged it as one possible option. In that respect, our government has its mind open on all options always. Like today I mentioned I am trying to rationalise the coal linkages. If I were to do that with seven separate entities, it would be almost impossible. But with Coal India in a structure of one company, its far easier for me to rationalize this without any loss, inter say, so there are certain advantages. Obviously there are disadvantages in terms of valuation because holding companies don't get the same value as individual operating entities. So one never knows what will happen in the future but as of now I think you need to focus less on form more on substance. What about disinvestment in Coal India? That's for the Hon'ble finance minister and others to take care of. I have no problem in that either way. There's no disinvestment as such. We are just asking more of the public to hold or own the fruits of Coal India because after all, it's a public company. The PM has been talking about the solar revolution. What are your plans for way forward? Solar is a great thing, again something which helps the peak load, which comes in peak hours. Storage is getting cheaper with the new technologies so we could at some stage look at dovetailing solar with high storage capacities and that could become an excellent off-grid solution for remote villages and remote areas. Leh-Ladakh has some far off places where it may be difficult to move transmission lines but a solar-cum-off grid solution could be a great idea. Similarly, looking at the huge potential of solar in India and the fact that it is renewable energy without any environmental degradation as long it happens on barren land, waste land and doesn't affect the agricultural or irrigated land parcels, I think it is a great idea and we will expand on it significantly. But money has been a problem... Money, off late, has been a bit of a problem for everybody. We shall find a solution. There is the other issue of imports vs domestic production. Are you seeking a reconsideration of dumping duty on solar panel imports from certain countries? I have sought reconsideration from both commerce and the revenue ministries. Logic being that, this is based on data of 2012, or thereabouts. At that point of time, the solar mission was a very small mission. India has a capacity of producing 600-700 mw and we are doing 400 mw or so. For that point of time, it made decent sense that the 400 mw gets sold or sourced indigenously. Now we are looking at expanding the solar mission manifold. And Indian manufacturing doesn't have the capacity. If you put these kind of tariffs and barriers, we won't be able to generate solar power to the extend we want to at competitive prices. Worldwide, prices have fallen so much that now solar can stand on its own feet. The tariff has come down to Rs 6.50-7. The critical aspect is that we certainly want to improve indigenous production. And we want to expand our capabilities and capacity in India to produce.</text>
