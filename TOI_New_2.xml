	<text>NOIDA: A journalism student studying in a city institute has accused four of her classmates of abusing her using sexually coloured remarks on Whatsapp. The student, a resident of Delhi, has complained that the accused who have been stalking her for months, tried to sully her image among her classmates and indulged in voyeurism by capturing her pictures unknowingly and made obscene gestures to her.

In the FIR lodged in Sector 58 police station, the student said that the accused, Amit, Nilesh Pal, Vivek Shukla and Vineet Sharma, called her to their room and on her refusal, they tried to humiliate her in front of everyone. "We have a Whatsapp group where all my classmates of MTV are added. The accused humiliated me by calling bids to my name. After this, I along with seven-eight classmates spoke to PK Gupta, director of our institute who scolded the accused once," the victim told TOI. "When the accused did not mend their ways, I spoke to the authorities again. Then I was told that the chapter has been closed from their side and I am free to approach the police and complain about the boys," she added. The student has also alleged that the accused have threatened to beat her and she is afraid for her life since she travels alone from Delhi to Noida. A case of stalking, voyeurism and criminal intimidation has been registered against the four accused and the investigation is on, a police officer confirmed to TOI. When contacted, an official from the administration of Massco Media institute, Sector 58, said that the director PK Gupta is currently out of India and will return after May 20.

	<text>NOIDA: Innovative mobile water dispensing machines, or a water ATMs will soon be installed across Noida by next month. Noida Authority on Friday said that for a start 25 ATMs will be located at high density areas and crossings of the city. A demonstration of the project was made to Rama Raman, Chairperson and CEO, Noida Authority. Once in place, people will be able to use prepaid cards, coins or a mobile application to receive filtered water at Rs 5 per litre or Rs 2 for 250ml from the dispenser called 'WOW (water on wheels) Gr8'. The e-carts holding the dispensers will be GPS enabled and equipped with automated water sensors based on cloud server application. According to Noida Authority officials, there are plans to install more such water ATMs this year. "We expect to scale up the project in the coming months in terms of number of machines and locations. Through this technology, the public can now get clean drinking water by swiping their smart cards in the machines or even by using mobile app," said Saumya Srivastava, Deputy CEO (DCEO), Noida Authority. "Once the pilot proves successful, there could soon be a network of such water ATMs at the city's busiest places," he said. Srivastava further told TOI that project is the brainchild of an NGO iGlory Foundation, which is ISO 9001:2015 certified with FSSAI license. The NGO will bear the cost of the water dispensing machine, which purifies water using reverse osmosis and holds 300 litres at a time. The Authority only has to provide space for locating the dispensers. "All Metro stations and crowded market places have been identified as probable locations for setting up these dispersers," Srivastava said. "The popularly available ice-water trolleys are unhygienic and bottled mineral water is expensive. With these water ATMS, things will change," he added. Speaking to TOI, Sandeep Bohra, founder of the NGO, explained how the water ATMs work. Much like how ATMs work, users can swipe a prepaid card or insert a coin and select the amount of water they wish to collect. Cards will come with an initial value of Rs 100 and can be recharged up to Rs 900. Transactions on a card will be recorded by the machine, which is connected to a server. While users have to bring their own bottles to collect water by the litre, paper glasses are available for 250 ml of water. Bohra further said that a large section of the population still does not have access to clean drinking water, and the aim of the project is to provide it at a reasonable cost, while being environment-friendly. "The machines are solar powered, the paper cups and residual water after Reverse Osmosis (RO) will be reused. We also plan to launch awareness campaigns for schools and college students," he said. "The machine will be loaded with CCTV cameras for women safety and LED panels will display water conservation slogans," he added. "The water dispenser is also equipped with a display board, which will show real time data, TDS, temperature and general quality of the water," he added. "If impurity is detected, the dispenser is programmed to automatically switch off," he said.</text>

	<text>Gurgaon: A 17-year-old boy, recently released from a juvenile home after he had sexually abused a 12-year-old boy, has been apprehended again after he allegedly raped his younger sister. The juvenile raped his 14-year-old sister multiple times, making her pregnant, cops said. According to sources, the family hails from Sonipat and currently lives in a rented accommodation in Bhondsi. The accused is third of the six siblings, while the girl is the fourth one. Both are school dropouts. During counselling, the girl said that she was raped for the first time a month ago. Since then, he raped her two more times. However, she didn't tell anyone because the accused had told the girl that he would tell their parents that she was of "loose character" and had been secretly meeting boys, said sources. "The girl was raped in the night while the rest of the family was sleeping in the other room. She is too young to understand what had happened to her and to speak against her brother," a relative of the girl told TOI. However, she recently realised that she is probably pregnant as she missed her monthly cycle. She confided into her elder sister who then shared her plight with their parents. Her father, a school bus driver, took her to the police station on Friday. An FIR was lodged under Section 6 of POCSO Act at Bhondsi police station.The accused was apprehended and produced in court. He is now back in Borstal juvenile home in Faridabad from where he came home recently.</text>

	<text>Gurgaon: An English teacher of a private school in the city has been booked for allegedly thrashing a Class IX student and rupturing his eardrum. The 14-year-old boy is currently recuperating in a private hospital. According to one Rishi Pal, a resident of Shivaji Park, his son Umesh Kumar was thrashed by his teacher Reeta Panwar for allegedly misbehaving in class. The incident took place at Sharda International School in Shiv Nagar on April 22. According to the student's father, the teacher slapped his son so hard that his left eardrum ruptured. "My son suffered a major injury on his left eardrum after his teacher hit him. We came to know about the incident only after he complained about the pain later in the evening. When we visited a doctor, he told us that his eardrum got damaged. Currently, he is being treated at Paras hospital," Pal, an employee of a private company, told police. An FIR has been registered at a city police station under Section 325 (for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of IPC against teacher Reeta Panwar on Thursday.

An FIR has been lodged against the teacher," said assistant sub-inspector Rajinder Singh, the investigating officer. When asked about the incident, the school principal denied that she had any knowledge about it. "We came to know about the incident from the police," Abha Raghav, principal, Sharda International School, said, adding, "The parents of the boy neither made any complaint to us nor did they meet us.

	<text>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Indian government will shift the Indian mother superior of an aid home in Aden out of Yemen where four nuns including were killed and an Indian priest kidnapped in an attack by gunmen on Friday, Kerala chief minister Oomen Chandy said. Speaking to IANS, Chandy said that after he spoke to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday night, Indian embassy officials from Djibouti have established contacts with Sister Sally, the Keralite mother superior of the old age home run by the Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. "I managed to speak to Sally a while ago and she said that she has been contacted by Indian embassy officials from Djibouti who are expected to come to take her with them on Monday. In her place (Yemen), there is no Indian embassy or any officials. "She said that things are not that smooth where she is and there is no information about the priest Tom Kuzhuvennal, who hails from Kottayam district and was taken away by these unidentified gunmen," he said. Chandy added that Sally was lucky to escape the attackers as she, along with a few locals, saved herself by hiding when these gunmen created mayhem. He said that according to reports that he got, these gunmen tied the arms and hands of the priest and took him with them. "She also said that there is no information about the priest," said Chandy. In the gunfire, four nuns of the Missionaries of Charity, including one from India, were killed. The Indian nun has been identified as Sister M Anseleme, 57, from Jharkhand. Of the other three nuns, two were from Rwanda and another from Kenya. The home, set up by Mother Teresa in 1992, houses 61 elderly destitutes and the Kerala priest had come to the home from an insecure place in Yemen. An official attached to Chandy's office, who is in constant touch with the convent and with Keralites in and around the place, told IANS that he has been told that things are fluid there. It has now been established that that these unidentified gunmen belonged to the Yemen-based affiliate of the Islamic State (ISIS) group.</text>

	<text>UNITED NATIONS: A 22-year-old Indian artist is among the three winners of a UN poster competition aimed at raising awareness about nuclear disarmament, with her poster of a peace dove slicing through a nuclear weapon garnering appreciation from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Anjali Chandrashekar, a New York-based designer and "artivist", won the third prize in UN Poster for Peace contest presented by the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (ODA) to raise awareness of the need for nuclear disarmament. Titled 'Cutting Barriers through Peace', the poster features a peace dove slicing through a nuclear weapon. (Image: Facebook/art.anjali) She received her third-prize certificate from Ban at an award ceremony held here on May 3. Apart from the three winners, nine honorable mentions were chosen from among more than 4,100 entries representing 123 countries. The young artist was only 10 when she founded 'Picture It', a non-governmental organisation that uses imagery to raise awareness and funds for various health, humanitarian and environmental causes. Another poster 'Break Free' by the Chennai girl, that shows doves flying out of a bird cage at the top of a nuclear weapon, received an honorable mention. "Nuclear disarmament is usually spoken about on such a high level and I believe that art has the power to humanize some of the most pressing issues that the world faces today," she told the UN News Centre. "It also transcends barriers of age, language and literacy so I thought this was a great opportunity for me to show that a brush can be mightier than arms." The first prize went to 38-year-old Ivan Ciro Palomino Huamani from Peru for his 'Spinning Peace', which features a nuclear weapon being unraveled into string which is then used to fly kites and balloons, and to jump rope. Second place winner, 15-year-old Michelle Li, named her poster 'Peace in our Hands', which features a shadow puppet of a peace dove above a broken nuclear weapon. Congratulating the winners, Ban said he commends them for the "talents you have displayed, and for using those talents to highlight such an essential cause." "At a time of many global needs, it is important that young people are aware of the threat posed by nuclear weapons, and the vital importance of disarmament. Young people did not create nuclear weapons, but it may be their task to eliminate them once and for all. The energy and enthusiasm, talent and new ideas we see here today will help to meet that challenge," he said at the award ceremony. Actor Michael Douglas , a UN Messenger of Peace, said that "creativity is essential" to creating momentum for nuclear disarmament. The competition was organised to commemorate the anniversary of the very first UN General Assembly resolution adopted in 1946 establishing a Commission to deal with problems related to the discovery of atomic energy.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: About 1,700 Indian workers who were arrested and deported by Kuwaiti authorities were found violating visa or residency laws of that country, government said today. "There is no problem in the case of people who have valid work visa as their problems are solved under the agreements (with foreign countries)," Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh said during Question Hour in Rajya Sabha. However, the task becomes difficult when workers reach foreign countries on tourist visas and then get them converted to work visas "through dubious means", he said. It is also not possible to keep records of all such people but added that the government reaches out to assist all its citizens promptly if they are found to be in a problem in a foreign land, Singh said. He said the government was sensitive to the needs of its workers and has "effective" agreements with many Gulf countries including Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to ensure their safety. The minister said the government has already set up an Indian Workers Resource Centre in Dubai and will set up two more in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Singh said he and his senior Minister Sushma Swaraj actively check their twitter accounts to reach out to any person needing assistance, while missions abroad were also sensitive to problems faced by any citizen. He said with the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs now merged with MEA, there was more coordinated effort in this regard.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: An Indian-American scientist has engineered T-cells - a type of immune cells - to break the pancreatic cancer's physical and immunological walls using immunotherapy. Dr Sunil Hingorani, member of the clinical research and public health sciences divisions at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and colleagues created T-cells with a high affinity to a relatively tumour-specific antigen. Dr Hingorani looked for proteins - also found in the linings of the heart and lungs - that are expressed in unusually large amounts in the tumour cells and minimally expressed elsewhere. The T-cells then were engineered to attack those. In the tests conducted on mice with pancreatic tumours, the engineered T-cells killed those cells over a 10-day period. Additionally, Hingorani and his team have worked to develop an enzyme that can help defeat the tumour's high interstitial pressures and potentially open the door for greater penetration and effectiveness of T cells and other types of agents. By the end of the year, Dr Hingorani hopes to have the human version of the T-cell in clinical trials. The findings were recently presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2016 in New Orleans, US.</text>

	<text>DOHA: An Indian worker died at the construction site of the Al-Bayt 2022 World Cup Stadium after he fell ill, the tournament's Organising Committee announced on Sunday. The worker, 48, died on Wednesday after suffering a cardiac arrest at the stadium's construction site in the Qatari city of al-Khor. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy of the 2022 World Cup announced that it has opened an investigation into the death of the Indian labourer to determine the circumstances of the incident. The conditions of workers building the Qatar World Cup stadiums have been reported to be very poor by several human rights organisations. Report of the deaths of hundreds of workers have also emerged. In March, Amnesty International warned against labour exploitation of immigrants in the construction work of the 2022 World Cup stadiums and facilities, and said that workers were living in subhuman conditions, without even the most basic of rights.</text>

Michelle wore a blush-coloured gown by the New York based designer which featured a bodice, full skirt and one-shoulder detailing. Naeem Khan has been one of the favorite designers of Mrs Obama, as she first wore his creation to her first state dinner back in 2009. The state dinner is usually for one Head of State. However, the President honoured five countries this time, including Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Norway. "She looks great," Obama said complementing his wife as they welcomed the guests at the North Portico of the White House. "He stepped on my dress," quipped the US first lady. Popular Indian-American actor and comedian Aziz Ansari attended the dinner along with his mother Fatima Ansari. Celebrities like Miranda Kerr, Tracee Ellis Ross, Al Roker, Connie Britton, David Letterman and Will Ferrell were also present. This was Obama's 12th State Dinner after he hosted the inaugural one for the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November 2009.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: A stock broker of Indian descent has been charged in an alleged $131 million stock manipulation scheme after investigations by a task force set up for President Barack Obama's war on financial crimes, federal officials announced. Pranav Patel of Tamarac, Florida, participated along with eight others in the multistate scam "through a dizzying round of unauthorized trades" to pump up the share price of a company with no business operations, Robert L. Capers, the federal prosecutor in Brooklyn said. The 35-year-old Patel was scheduled to appear later on Wednesday in a federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for legal proceedings to bring him to Brooklyn for trial. The case involved the NASDAQ-traded stocks of ForceField Energy Inc., which claimed to be a worldwide distributor of LED lighting products. The nine from four states across the US were charged with securities fraud, conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and making a false statement to law enforcement officials. The charges followed actions by the President's financial fraud enforcement task force that "was established to wage an aggressive, coordinated, and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes," Capers' office said. The nine, who included Naveed Khan of Staten Island, New York, "designed an elaborate but fraudulent scheme built on lies, kickbacks and manipulated trading activity to defraud the securities markets, the investing public and their clients," Capers said. "They took a company with essentially no business operations and little revenue and deceived the market and their clients into believing it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars through a dizzying round of unauthorized trades and deceptive promotions." "The scheme ended up costing investors approximately $131 million in losses," according to Diego Rodriguez, the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) New York Field Office. The prosecutor's office alleged that a ForceField official hired Jared Mitchell, the managing partner of a financial firm, to pay kickbacks using offshore bank accounts in 2014 to Patel and four other stock brokers for buying ForceField shares in their client's accounts to manipulate the price. The announcement did not identify the official, but Richard St-Julien, who was ForceField's chairman and founder, was arrested in April last year. He was charged with securities fraud conspiracy. He paid the alleged participants through a Belize-based company in a scheme to manipulate the company's share prices.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Union minister Suresh Prabhu on Saturday said his ministry is focusing on upgrading facilities for passengers and is set to launch new initiatives that will overhaul the "ailing" Indian Railways. Prabhu was speaking at the inauguration of five new infrastructure facilities at suburban Kanjurmarg railway station-- a six-meter wide foot over bridge (FoB) with escalator, 8-meter wide home platform with shelter for 12 coach trains, 2.5-meter wide pathway with fencing, booking office of five windows on east side. The minister inaugurated these facilities through remote control system from Dadar. Terming these measures as the beginning of new reforms, Prabhu said, "We will see a number of new initiatives that are set to overhaul of the ailing Indian Railways. In the past 30 to 40 years, the Railways did not attract the investment as it should have considering the rise in the country's population." The railway ministry is pushing hard to raise the comfort level of the passengers and in last two budgets, it received so much funds, which it had failed to get in the past, Prabhu said. The launch of the passenger amenities at the Kanjurmarg station was the part of trespassing control project (to curb death on tracks), in which six suburban stations have been shortlisted for the upgradation of the infrastructure facilities. Other five stations are Dadar, Kurla, Thane, Thakurli and Kalyan. Prabhu also said he had detailed discussion with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and with the co-ordination of the state government, his ministry was moving ahead with the integrated transportation system</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: State-owned United India Insurance Company on Friday reported a 26.3% fall in profit to Rs 221 crore in 2015-16, compared to the year-ago as the insurer paid out more in expenses than it earned in premium. The insurer, which saw a grow rate of 14.58% an improvement on the previous year's 10.12%, earned 14.6% more year-over-year in gross premium of Rs 12,250 crore. Expenses of the management increased by 10.4% to Rs 2,924 crore from last year. Net earned premium at the insurer increased by 13.7% to Rs 10,023 crore, while incurred claims as a percentage of net premiums improved to 87.80% from 86.43%. "We have been strong when it comes to engagement in social sector schemes. Under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yogana we have enrolled as many as 2.28 crore customers and so we have settled as many as 1,180 claims. And with the state government, we have seen increased enrolment for the pensioner's health insurance schemes with more than 6 lakh pensioners signing up," said Milind A Kharat, chairman cum managing director, United India Insurance. The value of investments that the public-sector undertaking earned remained nearly flat at Rs 19,665 crore compared to Rs 19,098 crore last year. Solvency ratio at the insurer - a key indicator that shows an organisation's ability to repay its debt and other liabilties - dipped to 1.91% from 2.14%. The company attributed the dip in solvency ratio to the impact of the Chennai floods, and expected solvency ratio to be at 2% or above in 2016-17. "For the Chennai floods we received as many as 7,480 claims amounting to Rs 1,413 crore with more than 98% of claims being settled," said Kharat. United India Insurance also declared a dividend of Rs 67 crore for this year, higher than its last year's declaration. The PSU insurer also launched a new product UniMSME Protect, aimed at catering to all the needs of small and medium scale enterprises. After the impact of the Chennai floods, the company feels that a customised product which combines fire, engineering, burglary, public liability will be well-received; particularly after the devastating impact of the Chennai floods on small industries.</text>

	<text>Investors and taxpayers should complete some tasks this month itself. The madness of March may be over, but if you take up the following tasks in April itself, it can save you headaches later in the year. Start tax planning right away Experts say it is best to start tax planning at the beginning of the financial year. If you plan to invest in ELSS, it is best to start an SIP in April itself. Our research shows that investors who took the SIP route earned more than those who waited till March to invest in ELSS schemes.Staggering the investments across 12 months not only cushions you against volatility, but also lighten the burden at the end of the financial year. TIME REQUIRED: 2-3 HOURS Get papers ready for tax filing The tax filing deadline is three months away, but it will help if you start putting together the information needed for filing returns. If you have foreign assets or earned foreign income during the year, start collecting documents right away. The tax department will be scrutinizing your interest income. Banks credit the interest on the balance in savings bank accounts in October and April. Add the total interest across bank accounts. Also add interest you would have earned on infrastructure bonds, NSCs, fixed and recurring deposits and other fixed income securities. If you have a home loan or an education loan running, get a certificate of interest to know the deduction you can claim. TIME REQUIRED: 2-3 HOURS Increase quantum of investments Your next paycheque could be fatter. You need to increase investments proportionately. Contribution to the EPF automatically. You can also increase the existing SIP amount or start fresh SIPs in other funds. TIME REQUIRED: 2-3 HOURS Submit Form 15G and 15H to avoid TDS This is also the time to file Form 15G or 15H to avoid TDS on interest. Form 15G can be filed by investors below 60 who do not have any tax liability and whose total income from interest is below `2.5 lakh. Form 15H is for individuals above 60. It can be filed if the final tax on the investor's estimated total income is nil.So, if you are above 60, your taxable income can be up to `3 lakh for you to be eligible for 15H. For super senior citizens above 80 years, this limit is `5 lakh. TIME REQUIRED: 1-2 HOURS Give VPF mandate to employer Instead of the PPF which will give 8.1%, salaried individuals can consider the Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF). VPF contributions are eligible for tax deduction under Sec 80C and are tax-free on withdrawal. Even if EPF becomes taxable in later years, the existing corpus will not get taxed. Submit your VPF mandate to the employer immediately. TIME REQUIRED: 15-20 MINUTES Organise investment portfolio If you don't know your asset allocation because all investments are not at one place, start using a portfolio tracker. Value Research has made it simpler for its users. All they have to do is upload the consolidated mutual fund statement and NPS details and all transactions get incorporated into the portfolio. TIME REQUIRED: 1-2 HOURS</text>

	<Heading>Pfizer says it's blocking use of drugs for lethal injections</Heading>
	<time_cap>AP | May 14, 2016, 11.17 PM IST</time_cap>

	<text>Pharmaceutical company Pfizer said on Friday that it was blocking use of its drugs in lethal injections, which means all federally approved drugmakers whose medications could be used for executions have now put them off limits. "Pfizer makes its products to enhance and save the lives of the patients we serve. Consistent with these values, Pfizer strongly objects to the use of its products as lethal injections for capital punishment,'' the company said in the statement made public on its website on Friday. The company's announcement has limited immediate impact. Its action is an enhancement of a previous policy that follows Pfizer's $15.23 billion purchase of Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira Inc. last year. Hospira had previously prohibited the use of its drugs in capital punishment, as have several other drugmakers. Pfizer shares closed even Friday at $33.19. The development means the approximately 25 FDA-approved companies worldwide able to manufacture drugs used in executions have now blocked the use of the drugs, according to Reprieve, a New York-based human rights organization opposed to the death penalty. "Pfizer's actions cement the pharmaceutical industry's opposition to the misuse of medicines,'' Maya Foa, Reprieve director, said in a statement. Pfizer's announcement was unlikely to have much effect on executions, which have slowed in recent years as drugmakers' prohibition on the drugs took effect. However, as recently as last year, records showed that labels of Arkansas execution drugs appeared to indicate that the state's potassium chloride, which stops the heart, was made by Hospira. Pfizer spokeswoman Rachel Hooper said the company couldn't speculate on the impact of its decision. Ohio, which last executed an inmate in January 2014, has repeatedly pushed back executions while it looks for drugs. It now has more than two dozen inmates with firm execution dates, but no drugs to put prisoners to death with. Some remaining death penalty states have been using compounded versions of drugs that fall outside of FDA approval. Texas, with the country's busiest death chamber, obtains its pentobarbital for lethal injections from a supplier the state identifies only as a licensed compounding pharmacy. A law that took effect last year keeps the identity of the drug provider confidential. The state has carried out six executions so far in 2016. At least eight are scheduled for the coming months, including two in June. Texas is fighting a lawsuit trying to force it to identify drugmakers from April 2014, when attorneys unsuccessfully filed appeals to stop two executions by seeking the identity of the drug providers, and September 2015, when the state's secrecy law took effect. Similar lawsuits about whether states must identify their providers have been argued in states including Georgia, Arkansas and Missouri. There have been 14 executions in the US so far in 2016 in five states: six in Texas, five in Georgia and one each in Alabama, Florida and Missouri. Last year, there were 28 in six states. Some states have passed laws allowing older methods of execution if needed. Last year, Utah approved the use of firing squads for executions if drugs aren't available, while Oklahoma became the first state to approve nitrogen gas for executions if lethal injection drugs become unavailable or are deemed unconstitutional. In 2014, Tennessee passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair if lethal drugs can't be found. Virginia is debating a similar bill. The seven drugs affected by Pfizer's policy: pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, propofol, midazolam, hydromorphone, rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide.</text>

	<text>Amit Acharya bought his first policy in 2000, when he was 29, and added four more plans as his income grew in the following years. Now 45, he regrets the investments made on his father's advice. "The life insurance plans he recommended will give barely 6% returns," says the Raipur-based MNC manager. In Delhi, 43-year-old Ashok Vishwakarma is ruing his decision to join SpeakAsia. He poured Rs 33,000 into the scam. "Had I not been greedy and put the money in a fixed deposit, it would have grown to over Rs 50,000 by now," he says. Many people make such investing mistakes in their youth, only to regret the decisions in later years. You can't turn the clock back, so it's better to avoid these mistakes now. Here are eight such money moves you might regret 15-20 years from now. Delay investing till income is higher For young earners, spending is more important than saving. A study of 2,000 professionals by Hyderabad-based financial planning firm, Arthayantra, found that more than 90% don't start planning for retirement in the first five years of their careers. Even by the 10th year, less than 20% would have a retirement plan in place. The consequences of this delay are mind boggling. If an investor starts an SIP of Rs 5,000 in an equity fund that gives 12% returns, he will accumulate Rs 1.77 crore in 30 years. But if he waits till 28 to start investing, his corpus will be smaller by Rs 56 lakh. What he puts away in the first 10 years will account for almost 72% of the total corpus. The longer the delay, the smaller is the corpus. Taking too little risk with investments Though there is irrefutable empirical evidence that equities can give high returns in the long term, small investors continue to rely heavily on fixed income investments. Equities account for a very small proportion of the total household savings. Surprisingly, even young investors who are in a position to invest in stocks, opt for the safety of bank deposits and small savings schemes. This aversion for equities could prove harmful in the long term. If you spend Rs 40,000 a month on household expenses today , even 6% inflation will push that up to Rs 72,000 a month by 2026. By 2031, the requirement will surge to Rs 96,000 and by 2036, it would be Rs 1.28 lakh a month. This is why even risk averse investors should consider allocating at least 10-15% of their portfolios to equities. Not following an asset allocation Not many investors believe in rebalancing. Less than 10% respondents to an online survey said they rebalanced their portfolios regularly. Yet, it is the mantra that ensures high returns at low risk. We back-calculated and found that if an investor had put 60% in stocks, 30% in fixed income and 10% in gold in 2006 and not touched the investment, his portfolio would have earned overall returns of 10.1%. However, if he had rebalanced the portfolio every year in January, his returns would have been higher at 12%. Rebalancing is not easy because it takes a contrarian call. Few investors would have reduced their equity expo sure when the markets were making new highs between 2004 and 2007. If they had, their portfolios would not have bled so much in 2008. If you rebalance regularly, you will not have any regrets. Getting lured by dubious schemes SpeakAsia and Stock Guru are just two examples of how investors can be lured by greed and easy money. The fantastic returns promised by the fraudster should have been a red flag for investors. It is virtually impossible to churn out 10-20% returns every month. The other basic check is to see whether the scheme is approved by the regulator. All investment schemes must have Sebi approval. Stock Guru had nothing to show in this regard. Fraudsters try to mislead investors by uploading images of PAN cards and certificate of incorporation. But these documents don't mean that the scheme has been approved by Sebi. Dipping into PF account The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is God's gift to investors. If you are diligent, it can make you a crorepati. A person with a basic salary of Rs 25,000 a month at the age of 25 can accumulate Rs 1.65 crore in the EPF over a period of 35 years. This assumes that his income will rise by 10% every year and the EPF will earn 8.7% returns. Yet, many people are unable to reach the Rs 1 crore milestone in their EPF accounts. Every time they change jobs, they withdraw their EPF balance. Withdrawing your EPF is financial hara-kiri. The money goes into unnecessary expenses and the retirement corpus is back to zero. It's a decision you will regret when you are close to retirement. Treating insurance as investment The cardinal rule is not to mix insurance with investment. Yet, millions of traditional insurance policies that give the "triple benefits" of life insurance, long-term savings and tax benefits are bought every year. These policies not only give sub-optimal returns of 5-6%, but also force the policyholder into a multi-year commitment. Is there a way out? Yes, you can surrender a policy if you have paid premiums for a minimum number of years. Be ready to suffer a loss when you do this. You can also convert an insurance policy into a paid-up plan after three years. The policy will continue with a reduced sum assured but you won't have to pay the premiums any further. It is better than paying premiums for the full term and earning 5-6% returns. Splurging on items you don't need As mentioned earlier, young people spend more than they save. But in many cases, they even spend more than they earn. Easy financing options and plastic money prevent young individuals from distinguishing their wants from their needs. They may need to save for retirement, but the new cell phone they want has come in the way. If this urge to spend gets out of hand, it can prove catastrophic. Rein in your spending now if you don't want to regret later. Many young people don't save because there is nothing left after all their expenses. Their equation is: Income Expenses = Savings. Legendary investor Warren Buffett offers a simple solution. Change the equation to Income Savings = Expenses. Instead of saving what is left after expenses, spend what is left after savings. Not setting up an emergency fund Everyone needs an emergency fund. You could lose your job, or somebody in the family may need medical care - you never know what lies ahead. It is often argued that you don't need emergency cash if you have a credit card. A credit card does come in handy when you face a financial crisis but the cushion that plastic money provides lasts only 15-30 days, till the bill arrives. If you don't have an emergency fund, you could be forced to liquidate other assets to tide over the crisis.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Shrugging off strong macroeconomic data, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell for the second straight session today and settled nearly 58 points down at 26.846.53 as IT stocks continued slide on caution ahead of TCS results. A weak trend in global markets after a data showed slump in Chinese imports, fuelling worries about the health of Asia's largest economy also weighed on the sentiments. Software stocks remained under pressure for the second straight day after Infosys yesterday slashed its dollar revenue guidance, clouding the outlook for the overall sector. The 30-share BSE Sensex after shuttling between 26,918.52 and 26,719.10 during the session finally settled lower by 57.58 points or 0.21 per cent at 26,846.53. The 50-share Nifty too dropped 11.90 points or 0.15 per cent to end at 8,131.70 after dipping below the crucial 8,100 level to hit a low of 8,088.60. The market showed some signs of firmness in early trade on the back of positive macroeconomic data with industrial production grew at a nearly three-year high of 6.4 per cent in August. However, retail inflation rising to 4.41 per cent in September, had a negative impact, and triggered selling. "Indices are struggling to maintain their crucial levels as selling emerges at every rise," said Manoj Choraria, a Delhi-based NSE broker. A cautious stance from the participants trimming positions ahead of the TCS earnings announcement, later in the day, too influenced trading sentiment. Stocks of TCS, country's largest software company, managed to close in the green at Rs 2,597.40 with mild gains. Sensex losers included ONGC, Hindalco, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, GAIL, Sun Pharma, L&amp;T, Hero MotoCorp, SBI, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank and HUL. Bucking the trend, Coal India, Lupin, BHEL, Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, Dr Reddy's, Axis Bank, M&amp;M, HDFC, Cipla, NTPC and RIL notched up gains up to 1.79 per cent. Of the 30-share pack, 15 closed with losses. Sector-wise, IT suffered the most by falling 1.03 per cent, followed by teck with a drop of 0.87 per cent. Broader markets, however, were in better shape as investors made selective buying, with the BSE small-cap rising 0.41 per cent while mid-cap index gained 0.02 per cent. Globally, other Asian markets ended lower with Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng falling up to 1.11 per cent, while European markets were showing an easy trend in their opening deals.</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Saturday stirred a controversy as he dubbed a section of Jadavur University's female students "shameless" for bringing molestation charges against ABVP activists. Claiming the molestation allegations were "false", Ghosh wondered why the female students were present when clashes broke out between Left-leaning students and activists of RSS student wing ABVP after campus screening of Vivek Agnihotri's film "Buddha in A Traffic Jam" on May 6. "Those who fear so much for their modesty, why did they go there? This is shamelessness. Making such allegations (of molestation) is very cheap. These girls don't deserve to be supported. They intentionally threw themselves on others and are now blaming others," Ghosh told media persons here. "ABVP is a students' organisation and has all the right to reach out to the students. If they (left students) believe in freedom of speech, then others also have that right. Why would they question the entry of BJP or ABVP activists in the university. "I feel very bad that being students of a university, they are bringing such indecent allegations. This is very shameful," he said. "If they understand politics, then they should fight democratically, they should fight politically. They are bringing down the level of politics and trying to get sympathy like this," he added. After the clashes, the university subsequently filed a police complaint against the ABVP activists for allegedly molesting female student. This is not the first time that Ghosh has spewed venom against the Jadavpur students. In March, he had threatened to "chop by six inches from top anyone who raised slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad'". He had also prescribed the varisty students be "thrashed with shoes". Ghosh's Saturday remarks were strongly condemned by a section of the varsity students and women activists.</text>

	<text>COIMBATORE: With the poll just round the corner, complaints of parties bribing voters have shot up. DMK men and election officials have been on their toes since Thursday night as complaints kept pouring in. AIADMK councillor from 14th ward, Thirumalayampalayam town panchayat, was arrested by the police for attempting to distribute money to voters on Thursday night. Police have seized Rs7.87lakh from him. Two IPC sections were invoked against him. The arrested person was identified as P Sundaram alias Krishnamoorthy, 53, from Kumittipathy village. He is the 14th ward councillor of Thirumalayampalayam town panchayat. At 10pm on Thursday, the rural police stopped him at Navakkarai and checked his motorcycle.

	<text>NEW DELHI: In a likely beefing up of India's ambitions in Afghanistan and Central Asia, Japan is reported to be considering partnering India in developing the strategically located Chabahar port project in Iran, which is seen as a counterweight to China's presence at Gwadar in Pakistan's Balochistan province. PM Narendra Modi is visiting Iran later this month and both countries are hoping to sign a commercial contract for the Chabahar port as well as modalities for India extending a $150 million line of credit for the project. The port located in southeastern Iran is expected to act as a gateway for India not just to Afghanistan but to the whole of Central Asia, allowing India to sidestep Pakistan. While diplomatic sources here said "nothing concrete had been decided" yet, this is not the first time Tokyo is reported to have shown interest in Chabahar. Its ambassador to Iran Koji Haneda had last year, before the international sanctions on Iran were lifted, had visited the port city on the Gulf of Oman and spoken about how the project could turn into a global trade hub. Apart from looking at developing the port jointly with India, Japan is also said to be considering building an industrial complex in Chabahar. In what will be a first in almost 38 years, Japan PM Shinzo Abe is expected to visit Iran in August this year. The visit is likely to see Japan announcing investments into some major infrastructure projects in Iran. An India-Japan partnership on developing the Chabahar port and industrial complex, according to strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney, will be a win-win initiative for all parties, including Iran. "Chabahar has greater potential than Gwadar to emerge as a key shipping hub. An India-Japan partnership on Chabahar will help to counter the strategic significance of the expanding Chinese footprint in Gwadar," he says. In the face of a renewed talk about strategic encirclement of India by China, as it gets operational control of Gwadar port and possibly also of Hambantota in the future, any involvement of Japan, an important strategic partner, in Chabahar will only reinforce India's own belief in the project. There are few strategic partners with which India shares a broader convergence of political, economic and strategic goals than Japan. In fact, any likely partnership between India and Japan on Chabahar could also be explained by the joint statement issued by the two countries after the visit of Abe last year in December. It said that Modi and Abe had decided to develop and strengthen "reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructures that augment connectivity within India and between India and other countries in the region". The partnership with Japan may be significant also in the context of reports that China itself is looking to park itself in Chabahar by building an industrial town there. India is now hoping to soon sign a draft agreement which envisions trilateral cooperation for providing alternative access to seas to Afghanistan through Chabahar and facilitate its own trade with Afghanistan. "When the Agreement comes into force it will significantly enhance utilization of Chabahar Port, contribute to economic growth of Afghanistan, and facilitate better regional connectivity, including between India and connections to Afghanistan and Central Asia," the government said last month.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: A court here on Saturday issued summons to environmentalist RK Pachauri, accused of sexually harassing a colleague, after taking cognisance of a chargesheet against him and holding there is enough material to proceed against him under charges dealing with stalking, words, gestures or acts intended to insult a woman's modesty. Metropolitan Magistrate Shivani Chauhan considered the charge-sheet and said that there is sufficient material to proceed against the former chief of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) under the Indian Penal Code's sections 354A (advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures), 354B (using criminal force against a woman), 354D (stalking), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 341 (wrongful restraint). The court, however, dropped charges under section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. "There are several allegations against that he made sexually coloured remarks upon the complainant on several occasions. He touched the complainant inappropriately on several occasions, despite a clear indication of disinterest and opposition from her side. He also sent inappropriate SMSs, whatsapp messages and e-mails to the complainant," the court said. "Let the accused (Pachauri) be summoned for next date." The court fixed July 11 for further hearing. A set of copy of the charge-sheet will be supplied to Pachauri at the next hearing. Police have cited around 23 prosecution witnesses and several text messages, e-mails and WhatsApp messages exchanged between the accused and victim as evidence to support its case. Pachauri was accused of sexually harassing a female colleague in 2015. He stepped down as chairperson of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in February last year and proceeded on leave from TERI, where he was the director general. In November, the woman researcher who accused him of sexual harassment quit her job at TERI, alleging she was treated badly. TERI denied the charge. On February 8, Pachauri was appointed executive vice chairman of the organisation. Following severe criticism, on February 12, he went on indefinite leave from the organisation.</text>

	<text>SRINAGAR: IndiGo airlines has terminated two of its ground staff besides suspending three more employees at the Srinagar airport for a week for security breach last month. The security breach at Srinagar Airport took place on April 1 when a senior AAI official allegedly misused his position and travelled on a boarding card of his subordinate. An IndiGo spokesperson confirmed the incident and termination of two of the airlines-employees. Sources, however, said that besides sacking the two employees on Friday, the Gurgaon-based budget carrier has also suspended three ground staff employees for seven days and issued them "warning letters" for "negligence" after investigations found multiple security breaches by a high-ranking security official at the aerodrome. Also, five other employees have been issued warning letters, the source added. "As per the internal investigation conducted by IndiGo, it was observed that the official flew from Srinagar to Delhi on flight 6E-436, using the boarding pass under a name of Vimal Kumar, AAI official at Srinagar Airport. "As per the inquiry, this passenger was observed breaching the security protocols multiple times, at Srinagar airport," an official of IndiGo airlines said. The official said Kumar had sent two of his colleagues (from AAI, based in Srinagar) to collect his boarding pass from the airport staff. "Following the protocol, the airline staff inquired the two AAI officials to present the photo identity - which is the standard procedure to collect the boarding pass. "The staff learned that these two officials from AAI were only there at the airport to collect the boarding pass for their senior colleague Kumar. "On grounds of the verification process, the airline staff immediately refused to issue the boarding pass to these AAI officials and demanded Kumar to be present at the check-in counter to collect the boarding pass," the official said. The AAI officials then requested a "familiar person" from the airline to accommodate the request on Kumar's behalf and "consider the cordial/working relations". "Based on the working relations with AAI officials, the staff agreed to issue the boarding pass, however the categorical remarks were inserted in the system against this request," the official said. After the boarding of 6E-436 flight, he said, three persons reported at the last minute at the boarding gate. "These three persons dismissed the instructions given by the boarding gate staff and walked towards the aerobridge to board the aircraft. "Before the official could board the aircraft, he was stopped for another security check point deployed by IndiGo security at the aerobridge. "After noticing this lapse by airline's security staff, the matter was immediately escalated to the concerned departments for a detailed inquiry," the official said. The official's act to furnish boarding pass from the airline staff, "misusing" the Airport entry permit and entry into the restricted security areas resulted in a "serious security violation", hence the two members of the staff have been terminated with immediate effect on grounds of negligence, the airline said.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has issued show-cause notices to AIADMK supremo and Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa and DMK President M Karunanidhi for violating model code, saying their election manifestos do not "substantially" fulfil its guidelines. The two notices, which have virtually similar wordings say that prima facie the manifestos of the two parties "have not substantially fulfilled the guidelines of the Commission". The poll panel gave them time till 5pm on May 15 to respond "to explain your stand for non-compliance of the guidelines of the Commission and also reflect the rationale for the promises made in your manifesto and broadly indicate the ways and means to meet the financial requirement for the same." The Commission warned that if the two leaders fail to respond to the show-cause notice, it will take "further appropriate action" against their parties without further reference to them." The show-cause notice is based on complaints from people regarding the election manifestos.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today laid emphasis on generating a mass movement to conserve water, saying youth organizations like NCC should be involved to create water storage structures as he reviewed the drought and water scarcity situation in Jharkhand. Emphasizing the use of technology, the Prime Minister asked the state government to identify all water bodies through unique numbers and geo-tagging. "The Prime Minister called for a mass movement to be generated for water conservation and rainwater harvesting in a comprehensive manner, and said youth organizations including NCC, NSS, NYKS, and Scouts and Guides should be involved in creation of water storage structures," an official statement said. Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das along with senior state officials and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh were also present during the high level meeting. The statement said that Rs 273 crore was released to Jharkhand as central share of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for 2015-16. "An added amount of Rs 143.25 crore has been released as first installment of SDRF for 2016-17. "The State has disbursed Rs 376 crore to 12 lakh farmers under State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF), through DBT. Insurance claims of Rs 53 crore were also settled through DBT," the statement said. Observing that there is a need to generate a mass movement for soil health cards, Modi said that "mobilization, momentum and mechanism" are all required to make the soil health card programme a success. He said soil testing should be developed as a skill and loans can be given for setting up labs through MUDRA. "Emphasizing the use of technology, the Prime Minister called for reporting of assets created by MNREGA, through geo-tagging and uploading of photographs with hand-held devices. "All water bodies to be identified through unique numbers and geo-tagging," he said. The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of regular monitoring of the progress towards implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Jharkhand plans to double its irrigated area from 19 per cent to 40 per cent in the next two years. One lakh farm ponds are planned to be built under the state plan, and an additional five lakh farm ponds will be built under MNREGA. The State is promoting fishery in the water bodies. The Chief Minister informed that tenders for the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana have been finalized in the State.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: After election officers seized Rs 570 crore in cash from three containers in poll-bound Tamil Nadu in the wee hours on Saturday, State Bank of India said this evening that it was the bank's legitimate cash. In a statement, SBI said its officials were ferrying Rs 570 crore after the RBI asked them to, to address a temporary cash shortage in Andhra Pradesh. "To address a temporary cash shortage in Andhra Pradesh, the RBI has authorised transfer of Rs 570 crore from our currency chest in Coimbatore main branch to our special currency administration branch in Visakhapatnam. Tamil Nadu election: Flying squad detains three trucks carrying cash worth Rs 570 crore A flying squad in Tiruppur district of election-bound Tamil Nadu detained three trucks carrying cash to the tune of Rs 570 crore in the early hours of Saturday. "As per RBI instructions, our Coimbatore main branch released the treasure to the authorised SBI personnel, duly escorted by a team of Andhra police. But the convoy carrying the cash was stopped by the EC officials enroute and brought to Tiruppur collectorate for further scrutiny," the SBI statement said and termed the EC action as "erroneous." The bank said its officials in Chennai, Coimbatore and Tirupur are providing all support and clarifications to the EC authorities and are hopeful of quick resolution and release of cash. "We reiterate once again this movement of currency is duly authorised by the Reserve Bank and has all necessary approvals. The movement is in line with the RBI currency management policy of moving cash from one currency chest to other where cash is needed," SBI said. In the wee hours today the EC officials took into its custody three trucks carrying Rs 570 crore during a routine check at the Perumanallur-Kunnathur Bypass in Tirupur district in the run-up to the polls. Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring Kerala and Puducherry are going to polls on Monday and through the campaign period, the EC has confiscated more than hundred crore in cash at various places in Tamil Nadu.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said government may seek voting on GST Constitution amendment bill in Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon session in case Congress continues to oppose the long-pending indirect tax law. "Only one political party, the Congress, and that is a political opposition. That is not an ideological opposition. I am trying my best to talk to them, so that they can come around. And if they don't, then, we'll have no option but to put it to vote," Jaitley said in a interview to All India Radio. Jaitley said the bill will be put to vote in next Parliament session even if Congress continues to oppose it, the AIR said in a release. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill, which has been approved by Lok Sabha, is pending in Rajya Sabha because of stiff resistance by Congress, the largest party in the House. Government has been insisting that most of the parties, except Congress, are in favour of GST, which will bring about a uniform indirect taxation regime in the country. Replying questions on GDP, Jaitley said the country can achieve even better growth rate if there is a favourable monsoon this year and improvement in global economy. "I think first important factor, which is beyond our control, is that the world starts growing faster. So if, global tail winds support us, then our ability to grow faster will be there. But thats something not in our control. "The second important factor is oil and commodity prices must remain at a moderate level. The present regime suits us, because as net buyers, we are buying at a cheaper price and therefore, we are saving a lot of money. The third important factor is that India's private sector has to get more active," he said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: India and the US have formed a Brain Trust aimed at deepening and strengthening cooperation between the best and brightest in the scientific community of the world's two largest democracies. The partnership between the Indian and American scientific community, researchers, academicians, businesses and entrepreneurs is a "win-win" for not only the two countries, but also the entire world, said Indian ambassador to the US Arun K Singh. "We find now a strategic convergence in our interest and we are working together in different areas," he said in his address at the inaugural dinner of the Indo-US Brain Trust here on Thursday. A partnership for research and development and scientific collaboration is essential to take this relationship to the next level, he said. "There is a huge potential there," he added. "Several major US companies have developed products in India, which their CEOs have said to me they could not have developed in the US because researchers and scientists here approach the problem from different perspective with different resource availability, they are targeting with different objective," Singh said. "Whereas in India the aim very often is to minimize the use of resources, keep the cost down, maximize the number of people that can be reached through the product and thereby you end up with something that is different and has relevance in a different context," he said. Applauding India's success, former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said India has now emerged as a model for other developing countries. "The idea is to create a platform- which partners scientific minds from both countries to explore and create timely solutions to pressing global challenges," said Ron Somers founder and CEO of India First Group welcoming the guests at the inaugural dinner. "The Indo-US Brain Trust must strive to create a shared platform for the US and Indian scientific communities to exchange, synergize, and deepen collaboration," he added. Dr Krishna K Banaudha, an Indian-American scientist and the brain behind the project, said Indo-US Brain Trust intends to assemble some of the finest minds and friends who, by their very actions and livelihoods, support a deepening of US-India collaboration in science, research, academia, entrepreneurship and innovation. "This group collectively represents the extraordinary partnership underway between the United States and India which is shaping a very bright future," he said.</text>

At Sanchi, Sirisena unveiled the statue of Dhammapathik Anagarika Dharmapala, a Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalist and writer who was one of the founding contributors of non-violent Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism. Expressing gratification over his visit, Sirisena said that he felt blessed and thanked MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP spokesperson Ram Madhav for inviting him to Sanchi. He also praised the government for establishing the Sanchi University of Buddhist-Indic Studies. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who accompanied President Sirisena announced building a `friendship park' near Sanchi University. ``The park will strengthen the friendship and cultural bond between the two countries'', he said. Chouhan also said that a grand temple dedicated to Sita would be built at the site where she had undergone `Angi Pariksha' in Sri Lanka. ``Expenditure on this would be borne by Madhya Pradesh government while, Sri Lanka government has agreed to provide land for the temple'', he added. Earlier, the Sri Lankan President along with Speaker of Sri Lankan Parliament Karunaratna Jayasurya, visited Chaityagiri temple and worshipped the holy relics of Lord Buddha's disciples Mahamoggalayan and Sariputta.</text>

	<text>RANCHI/NEW DELHI: Taking suo motu cognizance of the murder of two journalists in Bihar and Jharkhand, the Press Council of India (PCI) on Saturday set up two inquiry panels for both the states. Council members Kosuri Amarnath, Prakash Dubey and Prajnananda Chaudhuri will probe the killing of Rajdeo Ranjan, the bureau chief of Hindi newspaper Hindustan, a PCI source said. Ranjan was killed in Bihar's Siwan on Friday night. He was shot dead in a busy market near the Station Road. Four persons have been detained in the case. The fact finding committee for Jharkhand where television journalist Indradeo Yadav was killed will comprise of Prabhat Kumar Dash, Sondeep Shankar and Rajeev Ranjan Nag. Six persons have been interrogated so far in connection with the case. However no arrest has been made so far. The Chatra based scribe was shot dead on Thursday night. Chatra SP Anjani Kumar Jha however claimed police have gathered vital clues in the case. "We are working on the clues. We will reach a conclusion soon," he said. The PCI has meanwhile directed police and administration in both the states to submit their reports to the council. Journalists' bodies across India have condemned both the murders.

	<text>IMPHAL: JN Institute of Medical Sciences, the only state-run medical college in Manipur, has set a rare example: tending to poor and needy patients free of cost and even arranging to fetch them from far-flung areas. The free services rendered by the hospital, set up only a few years ago, are a boon to those who cannot afford the exorbitant hospital bills. Deven Laishram last week led a hospital team to pick up RK Tamphasana, a young housewife who was deserted by her husband when both her legs were paralyzed following a botched operation. She has been bed-ridden for the last five years. She had borrowed some money to feed and educate her son and invalid parents. Their patch of homestead is about to be taken away by the money lender. Laishram said, "JNIMS is also the hospital of the poor and Tamphasana will get the best treatment and free medicine." Specialists are doing their best to restore her health though amputation seems to be the only way out as all that is left of her thighs are bones. On Thursday a tribal woman, both legs paralyzed, was brought to JNIMS with the help of lawyers and other activists from Tamenglong district. The woman, Khalailung, was paralyzed after the birth of her third baby. By that time she became a widow. Her village Khamphai had no motorable road and the only treatment available was herbal medicine. While a district legal awareness camp was on in the village, her neighbours brought her in a litter from where lawyers and doctors took her to JNIMS. Aribam Noutuneswori, a district judge, said, "We heard about the plight of this woman one year ago and had approached the JNIMS authority." Laishram said: "Our medical team started the journey in the bridle path at 3 a.m. to fetch her. All specialists are now attending to her to see whether her health can be restored. She will get free treatment and medicines." Ramshing, the father of the patient, said, "We are poor people. Since we could not send her to any hospital she remained bed ridden. The Almighty shall bless those who have helped my daughter."</text>

	<text>DEHRADUN: The statement of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar when he visited Dehradun last month that One Rank One Pension (OROP) has been paid as promised has raised various questions among the veterans as they feel that they have been denied their due. The veterans are of the opinion that the government has changed the very definition of OROP and has not served the purpose for which OROP was being demanded for such a long time. This has not been taken well by some ex-servicemen since they feel that they have not got what they should have got as per Koshiyari Committee Report. Brig K G Behl (Retd), patron, Dehradun Ex Services League, told TOI,"No doubt they have tried to bring pension closer to the demand but it is less than the demand which has been approved by Parliament as per Koshiyari committee report. As worked out by our experts it is less by 5 to 22 % from actual demand. Moreover, it has not served the purpose for which OROP was being demanded for such a long time. We are told that we should go to courts if we have a problem but that's not easy especially for people sitting in remote places." Behl further explains that those who were getting maximum of the pension after serving for 33 years, by adding weightage of 5 years have now been reduced to 28 years of service have been given less pension than before introduction of OROP and the government cannot reduce the pension by framing such rules which work out to the disadvantage to the individuals. The Parliamentary Committee on Petitions on Grant of OROP, named after its Chairman, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari consisted of ten Members of Parliament (MPs) drawn from all the major political parties. It states that uniform pension be paid to the Armed Forces Personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service irrespective of their date of retirement and any future enhancement in the rates of pension to be automatically passed on to the past pensioners. Major Gen Lalji D Singh (Retd) seconding the thought said,"We are not happy because it has become one rank 5 pensions. Widows and honoury rank holders have been neglected but if they get the equalisation correct a lot of the problems will be solved. We are waiting for government to take the next step now." Pension equalisation has been decided for every 5 years and not in one year as the retired employees had wanted. Meanwhile, there are others who feel differently and are satisfied with the way OROP has been implemented. "OROP has been executed well but it is not easy to include all the conditions and the defence minister has promised that all minute will be sorted out at the earliest," said Brig V K Aggarwal (Retd).</text>

	<text>PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar will visit Lucknow on Sunday (May 15) to address a meeting of Kisan Manch which has launched a mass campaign against liquor and illegal mining in different parts of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, which is going to assembly polls next year. The CM will reach Lucknow's Amousi airport by air around 11.30 am on Sunday and from there he will drive straightway to the VVIP guest house where he is scheduled to hold a series of separate meetings with leaders of different social and political organisations. Nitish, a JD(U) leader said, would also meet with a delegation of Allahabad University Students' Union, led by Richa Singh who has been fighting against communal forces on the campus. "Nitish will reach Rabindralaya auditorium in Charbag area around 2 pm to address the activists of the Kisan Manch which has already launched a campaign in certain districts of UP demanding complete ban on liquor and illegal mining," JD(U) national secretary general and Rajya Sabha member K C Tyagi told TOI over phone. Tyagi said, the Kisan Manch was founded by former Prime Minister V P Singh and the Bihar CM was going Lucknow at the invitation of the Manch's woman wing. He said, Nitish would return to Patna by air in the evening soon after addressing the Kisan Manch's meeting. When Nitish implemented total prohibition in Bihar on April 5, it was hailed by the Kisan Manch across Uttar Pradesh and ever since the organisation had been struggling for total ban on alcohol in the neighbouring state. "Emboldened by Bihar government's decision, we since the first week of April have intensified our agitation against the liquor in UP and Nitish Kumar's address to our activists will certainly boost our morale," a woman activist of Kisan Manch said.</text>

	<text>LUDHIANA: Not only has Ludhiana, along with Khanna, earned the dubious distinction of being among the 20 most polluted cities in the world again, Ludhiana has also climbed up four notches in the recently released WHO survey on pollution. The WHO survey ranks Ludhiana at the 11th spot in the world while Khanna is on rank 14, four points up from 2014. According to the WHO's urban air quality database released on Thursday, Ludhiana has been ranked 11 (along with Delhi) among 3,000 cities in 103 countries in terms of PM 2.5 (fine, particulate pollution) and 26 in terms of PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) levels. Ludhiana's annual PM 2.5 mean for 2013 is 122 micrograms per cubic metres, says WHO's latest report. The organization's previous report pegged the value at 91 micrograms per cubic metres. Ludhiana's annual mean is about three times the Indian safe standard and 12 times the WHO standard of 10 micrograms per cubic metres. With rank 14, Khanna has PM 2.5 mean of 114 micro grams per cubic meters for 2013, much more than it's value of 88 during the last survey. Amritsar has also witnessed an increase in PM 2.5 value from 92 micro grams per cubic meters to 108 but the increase has been less as compared to Ludhiana and Khanna. Reacting to the report in the context of Ludhiana, Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), told The Times of India, "Ludhiana, being an industrial city, is known for its high pollution levels. Increase in rank of Ludhiana among the 20 most polluted cities of the world suggests that an action programme needs to be made for Ludhiana as was done for Delhi where pollution is decreasing as per the report. The agencies concerned must work keeping in view factors contributing to pollution, including vehicular and industrial pollution in the city". According to her, Particles (PM10 and PM2.5) are so tiny that they go deep inside the lungs, triggering respiratory and cardiac problems in the short term. Long term effects include lung cancer and other metabolic diseases. Meanwhile, residents are upset with Ludhiana's figuring among the world's most polluted cities. "It should serve as a wake-up call for all Ludhianvis. We need to make a proactive strategy to reduce pollution levels. We need to do it for both the present and future generations", said Ajaydeep Singh, a social and environment activist.</text>

	<text>BRASILIA: Brazil's interim President Michel Temer called on his country to rally behind his government of "national salvation," hours after the Senate voted to suspend and put on trial his leftist predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, for breaking budget laws. Temer, a 75-year-old centrist now moving to steer Latin America's biggest country toward more market-friendly policies, told Brazilians to have "confidence" they would overcome an ongoing crisis sparked by a deep economic recession, political volatility and a sprawling corruption scandal. "It is urgent we calm the nation and unite Brazil," he said, after a signing ceremony for his incoming cabinet. "Political parties, leaders, organizations and the Brazilian people will cooperate to pull the country from this grave crisis." Brazil's crisis brought a dramatic end to the 13-year rule of the Workers Party, which rode a wave of populist sentiment that swept South America starting around 2000 and enabled a generation of leftist leaders to leverage a boom in the region's commodity exports to pursue ambitious and transformative social policies. But like other leftist leaders across the region, Rousseff discovered that the party, after four consecutive terms, overstayed its welcome, especially as commodities prices plummeted and her increasingly unpopular government failed to sustain economic growth. In addition to the downturn, Rousseff, in office since 2011, was hobbled by the corruption scandal and a political opposition determined to oust her. After Rousseff's suspension, Temer charged his new ministers with enacting business-friendly policies while maintaining the still-popular social programs that were the hallmark of the Workers Party. In a sign of slimmer times, the cabinet has 23 ministers, a third fewer than Rousseff's. A constitutional scholar who spent decades in Brazil's Congress, Temer faces the momentous challenge of hauling the world's No. 9 economy out of its worst recession since the Great Depression and cutting bloated public spending. He quickly named respected former central bank governor Henrique Meirelles as his finance minister, with a mandate to overhaul the costly pension system. Rousseff defiant The Senate deliberated for 20 hours before voting 55-22 early on Thursday to put Rousseff on trial over charges that she disguised the size of the budget deficit to make the economy look healthier in the runup to her 2014 re-election. Rousseff, 68, was automatically suspended for the duration of the trial, which could be up to six months. Before departing the presidential palace in Brasilia, a defiant Rousseff vowed to fight the charges. In her speech, she reiterated what she has maintained since impeachment proceedings were launched against her last December by the lower house of Congress. She denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment "fraudulent" and "a coup." "I may have made mistakes but I did not commit any crime," she said. Rousseff's mentor, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who now faces corruption charges, stood behind her and looked on dejectedly. Even as outgoing ministers wept, Rousseff remained stolid. "I never imagined that it would be necessary to fight once again against a coup in this country," Rousseff said, in a reference to her youth fighting Brazil's military dictatorship. "This is a tragic hour for our country," said Rousseff, an economist and former Marxist guerrilla, calling her suspension an effort by conservatives to roll back the social and economic gains made by Brazil's working class. The Workers Party rose from Brazil's labor movement in the 1970s and helped topple generals who had held power for two decades ending in 1985. In the heady days of Lula's presidency, starting in 2003, it helped lift millions of people out of poverty before running into recession and scandal, with many of its leaders now tainted by corruption investigations and criminal convictions. Despite Rousseff's vows to fight, she is unlikely to be acquitted in the Senate trial. The size of the vote to try her showed the opposition already has the support it will need to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove her definitively from office. "It is a bitter though necessary medicine," opposition Senator Jose Serra, who became the new foreign minister, said during the marathon Senate debate. "Having the Rousseff government continue would be a bigger tragedy." Economic challenges Temer aides said the incoming government would soon announce a series of austerity measures to help reduce a massive budget deficit. An immediate goal is a reform of Brazil's costly pension system, possibly setting a minimum age for retirement, said one advisor. Brazilian markets, which for weeks have rallied because of expectations for a business-friendly Temer administration, traded similarly to a day earlier. Upon being notified of her suspension early Thursday, Rousseff dismissed her cabinet, including the sports minister, who is in final preparations for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August. The central bank governor, who has ministerial rank, was the only minister to remain. As suspended head of state, Rousseff can continue to live in her official residence, and is entitled to a staff and use of an Air Force plane. Fireworks erupted in cities across Brazil after the Senate vote, but the country took the change in stride. Some celebrants in Sao Paulo and other cities draped themselves in Brazil's green, yellow and blue flag, while some Rousseff backers protested. Temer, of the grab-bag Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, must stabilize the economy and restore calm at a time when Brazilians, increasingly polarized, are questioning whether their institutions can deliver on his promise of stability. In addition to the gaping deficit, equal to more than 10 percent of its annual economic output, Brazil is suffering from rising unemployment, plummeting investment and a projected economic contraction of more than 3 percent this year. "Only major reforms can keep Brazil from moving from crisis to crisis," says Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, an economist and author in Sao Paulo who has written extensively about the country's socioeconomic problems. But those changes, including the pension effort, overhauls of tax and labor laws and a political reform to streamline fragmented parties in a mercenary Congress, could remain elusive at a time of turmoil. Elected leaders from parties that had been in the opposition expressed optimism on Thursday that they could come together to help spur a recovery. Even some leftists said Temer may enjoy Congressional goodwill because, after his long experience there, he could ably negotiate with disparate parties and interests. "Temer is someone who knows Congress, said Hugo Leal, a socialist Congressman from Rio de Janeiro. "He understands the logic." Wild cards remain for Temer himself, including still-pending investigations by an electoral court into financing for his and Rousseff's 2014 election campaign. Then there is the far-reaching kickback probe around state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), which has ensnared dozens of corporate and political chieftains, and helped set the scene for the discontent that engulfed Rousseff.</text>

Most of those on board were Chinese tourists, Nine Network television reported Thursday.

	<text>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia: Malaysia's government said Thursday that two more pieces of debris, discovered in South Africa and Rodrigues Island off Mauritius, were ``almost certainly'' from Flight 370, which mysteriously disappeared more than two years ago with 239 people on board. The announcement means a total of five pieces of debris from the Malaysian Airlines' jet have now been discovered in various spots around the Indian Ocean since it vanished on March 8, 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said the two new pieces were an engine cowling piece with a partial Rolls-Royce logo and an interior panel piece from an aircraft cabin. This was the first interior part found from the missing plane. An international team of experts in Australia who examined the debris concluded that both pieces were consistent with panels found on a Malaysia Airlines' Boeing 777 aircraft, Liow said. ``As such, the team has confirmed that both pieces of debris from South Africa and Rodrigues Island are almost certainly from MH370,'' he said in a statement. In March, investigators confirmed two pieces of debris found along Mozambique's coast were almost certainly from the aircraft. Last year, a wing part from the plane washed ashore on France's Reunion Island. Flight 370 is believed to have crashed somewhere in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean about 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) off Australia's west coast. An ongoing search has found nothing so far. Authorities had predicted that any debris from the plane that isn't on the ocean floor would eventually be carried by currents to the east coast of Africa.</text>

	<text>MEXICO CITY: Mexico released a statement on Thursday stating that it was not satisfied with the Egyptian government's response to an aerial bombing in Egypt last year in which eight Mexican tourists were killed. The Foreign Ministry published the statement on its website in which it said that it had sent a letter to the Egyptian embassy to express its "surprise and dissatisfaction" with the government's failure to thoroughly investigate the case, penalize the perpetrators and compensate victims. In addition to the eight Mexicans, four Egyptians were also killed while six other Mexicans were wounded. Last September, an Egyptian army aircraft fired on a group parked for a barbecue near a tourist site, presuming them to be militants. The ministry said that although media outlets had reported on negotiations with one of the victim's families, Mexico did not have any knowledge of the case. The New York Times reported earlier this week that the Egyptian tourism federation would compensate families of three Mexican victims and it was also negotiating with families of the other Mexican victims.</text>

Ambulances with blaring sirens have rushed to the scene and soldiers have cordoned off the area. Residents blamed Boko Haram Islamic extremists though it was impossible to immediately verify the cause of the explosion. It comes the day after worshippers prevented a suicide bomber from entering a mosque on the outskirts of Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and headquarters of the Nigerian military's campaign against the jihadists. The military said the bomber blew himself up and wounded four people. Thursday's bombing would be the first successful attack in more than two months. Soldiers and civilian self-defense groups have reported preventing several suicide bombings in recent weeks.</text>

	<text>BEIRUT: Top Hezbollah commander Mustafa Badreddine was killed in an Israeli air strike at the Lebanese-Israeli border this week, the Lebanese Shi'ite group announced on Friday, the biggest blow to the group since the 2008 killing of its military commander. Badreddine, 55, was one of the highest ranking officials in the group, according to security sources. "He took part in most of the operations of the Islamic resistance since 1982," Hezbollah said in a statement announcing his death, describing Badreddine as "the great jihadi leader". He was killed on Tuesday night, the statement said. A US Department of the Treasury statement detailing sanctions against Badreddine last year said he was assessed to be responsible for the group's military operations in Syria since 2011. Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, is fighting in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Badreddine, a brother-in-law of the late Hezbollah military commander, Imad Moughniyah, was indicted by the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the 2005 killing of statesman Rafik al-Hariri. He was sentenced to death in Kuwait for his role in bomb attacks there in 1983. He escaped from prison in Kuwait after Iraq, under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, invaded the country in 1990. For years, Badreddine masterminded military operations against Israel from Lebanon and overseas and managed to escape capture by Arab and Western governments by operating clandestinely. The U.S. Treasury statement said Badreddine had accompanied Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah during strategic coordination meetings with Assad in Damascus. It also said he had led Hezbollah ground offensives in the Syrian town of al-Qusayr in February 2013, a critical battle in the war when Hezbollah fighters defeated Syrian rebels in an area near the Syrian-Lebanese border. Around 1,200 Hezbollah fighters are estimated to have been killed in the Syrian conflict.</text>

	<text>BRASILIA: Brazil's Senate will vote on Wednesday on whether to put President Dilma Rousseff on trial for breaking budget rules, amid expectations she will become the country's first leader in more than two decades to be removed from office. If her opponents garner a simple majority of the 81 senators, Rousseff will be suspended for up to six months during the trial and Vice President Michel Temer will take power. With well over half of senators telling newspapers they will vote to try Rousseff, Brazil's first female leader is expected to leave the Planalto presidential palace on Thursday, following 13 years of leftist Workers Party rule in Latin America's largest economy. The political crisis has hit at a time when Brazil had planned to be shining on the world stage, as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August. Senators are due to start discussion of the motion at 9am (1200 GMT) after each member of the upper house gets the chance to speak. The final vote is expected to take place around 8pm (2300 GMT). Rousseff, who has said her impeachment is illegal and branded it a 'coup,' has vowed to fight the process until the last minute. Her government appealed to the Supreme Court on Tuesday. "I will not resign, that never crossed my mind," Rousseff said in a speech on Tuesday, to cheers from supporters. Brazil is struggling with its worst recession since the 1930s and the country's biggest-ever corruption scandal - a long-running probe into a vast kickback scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras. The economic crisis and the Petrobras investigation have paralyzed Rousseff's second-term administration. There are worries the tense political situation may spark protests that could turn violent. On Wednesday, anti-impeachment protesters blocked roads with burning tires around Sao Paulo, the capital, Brasilia, and other cities, snarling morning traffic and prompting clashes with police. The Workers Party and labor unions have called for a national strike. The vote will cap a chaotic week that started with the newly installed speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Maranhao, saying he had annulled the full chamber's April 17 vote to impeach Rousseff. He argued the vote contained procedural flaws. Senate leader Renan Calheiros promptly rejected his decision and said the upper house would press forward with impeachment proceedings. Maranhao withdrew his decision on Tuesday, following complaints it was illegal. That cleared the way for the Senate vote. If the case goes to a trial in the Senate, presided over by the head of the Supreme Court, Rousseff's opponents are confident they can muster the two-thirds of the 81 senators, or 54, needed to unseat the unpopular president. Temer would then fulfill the remainder of her mandate until elections in 2018.</text>

	<text>TAIPEI: Buildings shook violently in Taiwan's capital Taipei Thursday as a 5.6-magnitude quake hit off the island's northeast coast, with strong aftershocks. The shallow quake struck at a depth of 10 kilometres at 11:17 am (0317) GMT, the US Geological Survey said, just east of the coastal city of Yilan, 60 kilometres from Taipei. There were only reports of minor damage according to Yilan fire department. It comes after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake in February left 117 dead when an apartment complex collapsed in the southern city of Tainan. That quake also raised questions over shoddy construction -- five people have been charged over the deadly building collapse. AFP reporters in Taipei said Thursday's quake rocked high-rise blocks. There were also reports by local media of power cuts and people trapped in lifts, with children fleeing screaming from classrooms in Yilan. A 5.5 aftershock swayed buildings in Taipei around 12:30 pm, its epicentre also just off Taiwan's northeast coast, USGS said. Taiwan's central weather bureau earlier reported two other aftershocks, both with a magnitude of 4.4. Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is regularly hit by earthquakes. A 6.3-magnitude quake that hit central Taiwan in June 2013 killed four people and caused widespread landslides. The island's worst quake disaster came in September 1999 when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake killed around 2,400 people.</text>

	<text>BRASILIA: Brazil's attorney general has issued an injunction to cancel President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment process. Under the Brazilian law, such an injunction must be analysed by one of the 11 Supreme Court judges, randomly appointed in order to avoid bias, Xinhua news agency reported. In this case, the judge to analyse the injunction will be Teori Zavascki, who, last week, ruled that House speaker Eduardo Cunha should be suspended from office for trying to coerce other congressmen and hinder investigations against him. Zavascki's office said he will analyse the case overnight and announce his decision on Wednesday. In the injunction issued on Tuesday, Attorney General Jose Eduardo Cardozo argued that there were vices in the process. In the very beginning of the case, Cunha repeatedly said that the impeachment requests filed in the House lacked legal basis, until the ruling Workers' Party declined to support him over a corruption case in the House Ethics Committee. Then he suddenly changed his mind and turned for an immediate impeachment process. Cardozo said that Cunha clearly started the impeachment process in a vendetta after his attempt to blackmail the government failed, and that the partiality continued with the choice of Representative Jovair Arantes as the rapporteur of the process. Cardozo accuses Arantes of preparing a biased report in favour of the impeachment in exchange for Cunha's support in the next election for House speaker. According to the attorney general, the entire session must be cancelled for it was the result of abuse of power. Earlier this week, the new interim House speaker, Waldir Maranhao, accepted an appeal made by Cardozo and decided to cancel the House voting, which decided for the start of the impeachment process. However, the Senate insisted on proceeding with the vote. Under political pressure, Maranhao announced on Tuesday morning a decision to annul the cancellation. If the impeachment motion is approved, Rousseff will be temporarily removed from office for up to 180 days, leaving Vice President Michel Temer to take over as interim president during her trial.</text>

	<text>BANGKOK: The sexual abuse of children by tourists and travellers is a growing scourge around the globe that has largely managed to outwit attempts to curb it in the last two decades, a major study warned on Thursday. The landmark report released in Thailand, South Africa and Washington makes for grim reading, with researchers concluding that "no region is untouched by this crime and no country is 'immune'". More than 70 child protection agencies, charities and academics contributed to the UN-backed 'Global Study on Sexual Exploitation of Children in Travel and Tourism'- trailed as the most comprehensive review of its kind. "We now have the largest bank of information ever gathered on this issue. And the main finding is that, despite 20 years of hard work, exploitation in travel and tourism has expanded across the globe, outpacing attempts to stop it," Dorothy Rozga, executive director of ECPAT International which oversaw the report, said at the Bangkok launch. While the nature and level of child sex abuse by travellers varies from region to region, the report's authors pinpoint two major contributing causes for its spread- cheap travel and new technology that allows predators to share information and abuse more easily. The authors say public and policing perceptions of child sex tourism are often outdated. "White, Western, wealthy, middle-aged men are no longer the typical offender," they write. Instead offenders can come from all walks of life, with many perpetrators opportunists and not people who would consider themselves serial paedophiles. "They do, however, have one thing in common- the chances of being arrested, charged and punished remain slight. Repeat offenders target the countries with the weakest legislation and enforcement. There is a valid sense of 'impunity'," Rozga said. An example of child sex tourism's changing nature can be seen in Southeast Asia, long one of the globe's biggest child sex tourism hotspots. The authors note that while white Western paedophiles are still a problem, enforcement has tightened thanks to increased cooperation between Western governments and Southeast Asian nations. Dutch ambassador Karel Hartogh highlighted that work at the Bangkok launch but said much more needed to be done. "Right now millions of children around the world are still at risk of sexual abuse. We should and can better protect them," he said. In Southeast Asia however victims are more likely to be targeted by local or regional travellers, such as Japanese, Chinese and South Korean tourists, primarily because they travel throughout the region in far greater numbers. "Research into the scope and nature" of that change, the authors say, is "urgently required". Europe, once known as primarily a source of paedophile tourists, is now emerging as a destination, especially in some Central and Eastern European nations that are lacking child protection laws. In the Middle East and North Africa, the authors cite ongoing conflicts, the low status of women in many cultures and traditions such as "temporary marriage" as contributing factors. Poor countries in South Asia and Latin America that already have a reputation for weak law enforcement, meanwhile, have seen huge expansion in both local and foreign travel. Predators are also able to abuse in increasingly remote places. Researchers say, for example, that there is anecdotal evidence that children can be increasingly bought for sex in places such as Myanmar, Laos, Moldova, Peru and some Pacific Island nations. "Twenty years ago, it might have been possible to sketch a rough global map showing where international travelling sex offenders were from, and where they were going," the study says adding, "Today, the distinctions between countries of origin and countries of destination are blurring." With convictions remaining low, "more collective actions" are needed "to prevent this crime and better protect children", according to Rozga.</text>

	<text>NAIROBI: The Kenyan government will close Dadaab refugee camp which has hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees and is often referred to as the world's largest camp, the East African country's interior security minister said Wednesday. The decision has been condemned by domestic and international rights groups and organizations dealing with refugees. Dadaab camp, with an estimated 328,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia, compromises Kenya's security because it harbors some of Somalia's al-Shabab Islamic extremists and is a conduit for smuggling weapons, Joseph Nkaissery said. He said al-Shabab planned three large-scale attacks from Dadaab. Last week the Kenyan government announced it intends to close Dadaab as well as Kakuma, a refugee camp housing 190,000 people, mostly South Sudanese fleeing civil war. At the same time the interior ministry said it had disbanded the department of refugee affairs, which oversees the registration and welfare of refugees. But on Wednesday Nkaissery said Kakuma will not be closed because it does not present a security risk. The un has urged Kenya to reconsider its decision to close Dadaab camp. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the UN is calling on Kenya's government to avoid any action that is at odds with its international obligations. Eleven non-governmental organizations operating in Kenya issued a statement Tuesday urging the government to reconsider the intended closure of the refugee camp. Those signing the statement include the International Rescue Committee, World Vision, the Danish Refugee Council, Jesuit Refugee Service, Action Africa, Help International, the Lutheran World Federation, OXFAM, The Refugee Consortium of Kenya, Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and Heshima Kenya. The group urged other countries to expand their resettlement quotas for refugees coming from the Horn of Africa in order to help Kenya and share the burden of hosting refugees.</text>

	<text>BRASILIA: Brazil's interim President Michel Temer called on his country to rally behind his government of "national salvation," hours after the Senate voted to suspend and put on trial his leftist predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, for breaking budget laws. Temer, a 75-year-old centrist now moving to steer Latin America's biggest country toward more market-friendly policies, told Brazilians to have "confidence" they would overcome an ongoing crisis sparked by a deep economic recession, political volatility and a sprawling corruption scandal. "It is urgent we calm the nation and unite Brazil," he said, after a signing ceremony for his incoming cabinet. "Political parties, leaders, organizations and the Brazilian people will cooperate to pull the country from this grave crisis." Brazil's crisis brought a dramatic end to the 13-year rule of the Workers Party, which rode a wave of populist sentiment that swept South America starting around 2000 and enabled a generation of leftist leaders to leverage a boom in the region's commodity exports to pursue ambitious and transformative social policies. But like other leftist leaders across the region, Rousseff discovered that the party, after four consecutive terms, overstayed its welcome, especially as commodities prices plummeted and her increasingly unpopular government failed to sustain economic growth. In addition to the downturn, Rousseff, in office since 2011, was hobbled by the corruption scandal and a political opposition determined to oust her. After Rousseff's suspension, Temer charged his new ministers with enacting business-friendly policies while maintaining the still-popular social programs that were the hallmark of the Workers Party. In a sign of slimmer times, the cabinet has 23 ministers, a third fewer than Rousseff's. A constitutional scholar who spent decades in Brazil's Congress, Temer faces the momentous challenge of hauling the world's No. 9 economy out of its worst recession since the Great Depression and cutting bloated public spending. He quickly named respected former central bank governor Henrique Meirelles as his finance minister, with a mandate to overhaul the costly pension system. Rousseff defiant The Senate deliberated for 20 hours before voting 55-22 early on Thursday to put Rousseff on trial over charges that she disguised the size of the budget deficit to make the economy look healthier in the runup to her 2014 re-election. Rousseff, 68, was automatically suspended for the duration of the trial, which could be up to six months. Before departing the presidential palace in Brasilia, a defiant Rousseff vowed to fight the charges. In her speech, she reiterated what she has maintained since impeachment proceedings were launched against her last December by the lower house of Congress. She denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment "fraudulent" and "a coup." "I may have made mistakes but I did not commit any crime," she said. Rousseff's mentor, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who now faces corruption charges, stood behind her and looked on dejectedly. Even as outgoing ministers wept, Rousseff remained stolid. "I never imagined that it would be necessary to fight once again against a coup in this country," Rousseff said, in a reference to her youth fighting Brazil's military dictatorship. "This is a tragic hour for our country," said Rousseff, an economist and former Marxist guerrilla, calling her suspension an effort by conservatives to roll back the social and economic gains made by Brazil's working class. The Workers Party rose from Brazil's labor movement in the 1970s and helped topple generals who had held power for two decades ending in 1985. In the heady days of Lula's presidency, starting in 2003, it helped lift millions of people out of poverty before running into recession and scandal, with many of its leaders now tainted by corruption investigations and criminal convictions. Despite Rousseff's vows to fight, she is unlikely to be acquitted in the Senate trial. The size of the vote to try her showed the opposition already has the support it will need to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove her definitively from office. "It is a bitter though necessary medicine," opposition Senator Jose Serra, who became the new foreign minister, said during the marathon Senate debate. "Having the Rousseff government continue would be a bigger tragedy." Economic challenges Temer aides said the incoming government would soon announce a series of austerity measures to help reduce a massive budget deficit. An immediate goal is a reform of Brazil's costly pension system, possibly setting a minimum age for retirement, said one advisor. Brazilian markets, which for weeks have rallied because of expectations for a business-friendly Temer administration, traded similarly to a day earlier. Upon being notified of her suspension early Thursday, Rousseff dismissed her cabinet, including the sports minister, who is in final preparations for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August. The central bank governor, who has ministerial rank, was the only minister to remain. As suspended head of state, Rousseff can continue to live in her official residence, and is entitled to a staff and use of an Air Force plane. Fireworks erupted in cities across Brazil after the Senate vote, but the country took the change in stride. Some celebrants in Sao Paulo and other cities draped themselves in Brazil's green, yellow and blue flag, while some Rousseff backers protested. Temer, of the grab-bag Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, must stabilize the economy and restore calm at a time when Brazilians, increasingly polarized, are questioning whether their institutions can deliver on his promise of stability. In addition to the gaping deficit, equal to more than 10 percent of its annual economic output, Brazil is suffering from rising unemployment, plummeting investment and a projected economic contraction of more than 3 percent this year. "Only major reforms can keep Brazil from moving from crisis to crisis," says Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, an economist and author in Sao Paulo who has written extensively about the country's socioeconomic problems. But those changes, including the pension effort, overhauls of tax and labor laws and a political reform to streamline fragmented parties in a mercenary Congress, could remain elusive at a time of turmoil. Elected leaders from parties that had been in the opposition expressed optimism on Thursday that they could come together to help spur a recovery. Even some leftists said Temer may enjoy Congressional goodwill because, after his long experience there, he could ably negotiate with disparate parties and interests. "Temer is someone who knows Congress, said Hugo Leal, a socialist Congressman from Rio de Janeiro. "He understands the logic." Wild cards remain for Temer himself, including still-pending investigations by an electoral court into financing for his and Rousseff's 2014 election campaign. Then there is the far-reaching kickback probe around state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), which has ensnared dozens of corporate and political chieftains, and helped set the scene for the discontent that engulfed Rousseff.</text>

	<text>PHNOM PENH: For years, some Cambodian media have referred to the country's longtime leader simply as Prime Minister Hun Sen. Authorities warned on Thursday that it has to stop. Starting in August, all media must use his full, honorary, six-word title "Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen'' in the opening lines of print articles, radio and TV stories about the leader. The title translates roughly to "Lord Prime Minister and Supreme Military Commander" and was bestowed on Hun Sen by Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni in 2007. The information ministry held a nearly three-hour meeting for journalists Thursday to announce the new guidelines and warn that legal action will be taken against media that don't comply. Officials gave no specifics on the punishment for flouting the rule, which they said was important to show respect for leaders who hold Cambodia's highest titles. The new rule appeared aimed specifically at media viewed by the government as pro-opposition and pro-Western. Pro-government media typically refer to officials with their honorary titles. It comes amid a series of moves by Hun Sen's government to put legal pressure on its critics and political opponents. During his three decades in power, Hun Sen has long exerted strong control over the media, and expressing public dissent in Cambodia remains risky. The government has tightened controls on telecommunications and threatens prosecution of online critics, especially those commenting on Hun Sen and his family. "We want you to state the full title of leaders in the story's lead or first sentence," said Ouk Kimseng, an under-secretary of state at the information ministry, who led the meeting. Subsequent references can drop the long title, he said. The ministry has issued similar warnings before, which were largely ignored. The rule also applies to several ruling party officials. Hun Sen's wife Bun Rany was given a royal title in 2013 that translates to "Celebrated Senior Scholar Bun Rany Hun Sen." It refers to an honorary PhD that was given to the first lady, who never formally graduated from university.</text>

	<text>ILALO, ECUADOR: An Ecuadoran who lost both his feet is aiming to become the first climber to scale the world's toughest mountain, K2, with artificial limbs and without oxygen supplies. Santiago Quintero had half of each foot amputated for frostbite after climbing Aconcagua in Argentina in 2002. But that has not stopped him. "They told me I would never climb 5,000-meter mountains again," the smiling 41-year-old told AFP. "But no one can tell me how I am and what I am. Being what I want to be is my decision." Quintero scaled Mount Everest, the world's highest peak at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet), in 2013. The expedition landed him in the hospital in intensive care. Now he is aiming to conquer K2 -- the second-highest mountain at 8,611 meters, but considered technically the hardest to climb. He ascended K2, which is on the border between China and Pakistan, once before but stopped short of the summit. His party had to turn back when they sank up to their chests in snow. He says he caught frostbite on Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas, because he could not afford a $100 pair of waterproof covers for his boots. He spent nine months in the hospital in Spain, where doctors performed the amputations, then a further five years waiting to have prosthetic feet fitted. With those artificial members, he has already scaled seven of the 14 mountains in the world that are over 8,000 meters high. In total 188 mountaineers have scaled K2. "They did it with their bodies fully intact," said Quintero. "That's quite different." He plans to start his hike up K2 on June 13 and finish on July 31. "I am quite determined," he told AFP, while resting during a training climb on the extinct Ilalo volcano in northern Ecuador. "Without the mountains, I think I would rather be dead."</text>

Rousseff, 68, was automatically suspended for the duration of the trial, which could be up to six months. Before departing the presidential palace in Brasilia, a defiant Rousseff vowed to fight the charges. In her speech, she reiterated what she has maintained since impeachment proceedings were launched against her last December by the lower house of Congress. She denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment "fraudulent" and "a coup." "I may have made mistakes but I did not commit any crime," she said. Rousseff's mentor, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who now faces corruption charges, stood behind her and looked on dejectedly. Even as outgoing ministers wept, Rousseff remained stolid. "I never imagined that it would be necessary to fight once again against a coup in this country," Rousseff said, in a reference to her youth fighting Brazil's military dictatorship. "This is a tragic hour for our country," said Rousseff, an economist and former Marxist guerrilla, calling her suspension an effort by conservatives to roll back the social and economic gains made by Brazil's working class. The Workers Party rose from Brazil's labor movement in the 1970s and helped topple generals who had held power for two decades ending in 1985. In the heady days of Lula's presidency, starting in 2003, it helped lift millions of people out of poverty before running into recession and scandal, with many of its leaders now tainted by corruption investigations and criminal convictions. Despite Rousseff's vows to fight, she is unlikely to be acquitted in the Senate trial. The size of the vote to try her showed the opposition already has the support it will need to reach the two-thirds majority required to remove her definitively from office. "It is a bitter though necessary medicine," opposition Senator Jose Serra, who became the new foreign minister, said during the marathon Senate debate. "Having the Rousseff government continue would be a bigger tragedy." Economic challenges Temer aides said the incoming government would soon announce a series of austerity measures to help reduce a massive budget deficit. An immediate goal is a reform of Brazil's costly pension system, possibly setting a minimum age for retirement, said one advisor. Brazilian markets, which for weeks have rallied because of expectations for a business-friendly Temer administration, traded similarly to a day earlier. Upon being notified of her suspension early Thursday, Rousseff dismissed her cabinet, including the sports minister, who is in final preparations for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August. The central bank governor, who has ministerial rank, was the only minister to remain. As suspended head of state, Rousseff can continue to live in her official residence, and is entitled to a staff and use of an Air Force plane. Fireworks erupted in cities across Brazil after the Senate vote, but the country took the change in stride. Some celebrants in Sao Paulo and other cities draped themselves in Brazil's green, yellow and blue flag, while some Rousseff backers protested. Temer, of the grab-bag Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, must stabilize the economy and restore calm at a time when Brazilians, increasingly polarized, are questioning whether their institutions can deliver on his promise of stability. In addition to the gaping deficit, equal to more than 10 percent of its annual economic output, Brazil is suffering from rising unemployment, plummeting investment and a projected economic contraction of more than 3 percent this year. "Only major reforms can keep Brazil from moving from crisis to crisis," says Eduardo Giannetti da Fonseca, an economist and author in Sao Paulo who has written extensively about the country's socioeconomic problems. But those changes, including the pension effort, overhauls of tax and labor laws and a political reform to streamline fragmented parties in a mercenary Congress, could remain elusive at a time of turmoil. Elected leaders from parties that had been in the opposition expressed optimism on Thursday that they could come together to help spur a recovery. Even some leftists said Temer may enjoy Congressional goodwill because, after his long experience there, he could ably negotiate with disparate parties and interests. "Temer is someone who knows Congress, said Hugo Leal, a socialist Congressman from Rio de Janeiro. "He understands the logic." Wild cards remain for Temer himself, including still-pending investigations by an electoral court into financing for his and Rousseff's 2014 election campaign. Then there is the far-reaching kickback probe around state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), which has ensnared dozens of corporate and political chieftains, and helped set the scene for the discontent that engulfed Rousseff.</text>

	<text>SAO PAULO: National and state highways across Brazil were blocked with the piles of burning wood and tyres on Tuesday and Wednesday as large groups of people carrying red flags and banners protested against the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Activists from unions and social movements streamed over to roads and disrupted all forms of transport in 21 states and the national capital, Brasilia. A day earlier, a group of angry students had stormed the Great Hall of Presidential Palace, shouting slogans against the "coup" and in support of the embattled president and her predecessor Lula de Silva. But with the Senate all set to vote on the process to suspend the president on Wednesday, Brazil was staring at a crisis that may plunge the country into chaos with less than 100 days to go for the Rio Olympics. With the social movements and activists threatening to storm the streets to protest the impeachment, dark clouds now hang over the biggest sporting spectacle in the world. The tension-filled day ended with smoke billowing from the fires on roads, rallies in public squares in various cities and an all-our war between the supporters and opponents of Rousseff over social networks. The president, who is certain to be suspended by the Senate on late Wednesday, left her office on Tuesday evening with all her personal belongings. Her suspension may last for 180 days during which the impeachment process would go on in the Senate. In this period, Vice President Michel Temer, who has been quietly working on to form a new Cabinet, would act as the president of the biggest South American country. Temer, a controversial figure, enjoys a popularity of less than 2% and faces rejection from most of the 54 million Brazilians who voted for Rousseff in December 2014 elections. Brazil has been in the grip of uncertainty since April 17, when the lower house of the parliament passed a vote to begin the impeachment proceedings against Rousseff, the first woman president of Latin America's biggest economy. Elected to office first time in 2010, Rousseff has vowed to fight till the end. Suspension from office by no means is the end of Rousseff presidency. She may return to office if the Senate fails to pass the impeachment vote by two-thirds majority. That vote may happen as early as in mid-July or latest by November. Though cornered by a gaggle of parties who have all come together to impeach her, Rousseff is fighting hard to save her government, constantly calling the move a "coup" by Temer whom she has dubbed a "usurper" of power. On Tuesday, just a day before her looming suspension from office, Rousseff said she was tired of the "traitors", a clear reference to Temer and Eduardo Cunha, the Speaker of lower house who started the impeachment process against her. Last week, Cunha was himself suspended from his post by the Supreme Court for corruption. "I want to tell you that I am not tired of fighting. I'm tired of unfair treatment and traitors. I'm sure that Brazil is also tired of the disloyal and traitors, and it is this strain that drives my fight every day more," Rousseff said, speaking at an event on women empowerment. Interestingly, Rousseff's popularity is on the rise as she has been travelling across the country since the April 17 vote in Congress. Meeting people and announcing more social programmes for the poor communities, Rousseff has mobilized popular support in her favour even as she faces stiff opposition in both the houses of Brazilian parliament. But Rousseff may still survive the final vote in the Senate; she also has the recourse to challenge the Senate's decision in the Supreme Court, which has so far kept quiet on the issue. Whatever the result in Senate now and later, there's no denying that Brazil is in the throes of a crisis that may worsen the situation caused by a wobbling economy and a corruption scandal that has engulfed the entire political class, even stinging Lula who lef the Presidential Palace in 2010 with 80% approval rating. This whole week, the country has been buzzing with the rumours of Lula being arrested in the Petrobras scandal, known as Operation Car Wash, as soon as Rousseff is put under suspension. Though the former president was detained for questioning a few weeks ago, no evidence of his involvement in the scandal has been produced by the police so far. Unlike opposition leaders who have been involved in multiple corruption scams, no charge or evidence of corruption has been produced against Dilma Rousseff. She is being impeached for "fiscal indiscipline", a common practice in this country. Few judicial experts believe that a "crime of responsibility", the basic requirement for impeachment, can be finally proved against Rousseff. But with her suspension almost certain, Lula's detention a clear possibility and fires being lit on the streets across the country, Michel Temer would be looking at a deeply divided and angry country when he assumes as the interim president of Brazil on Thursday.</text>

	<text>BRASILIA: Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was suspended on Thursday to face impeachment, ceding power to her vice-president-turned-enemy Michel Temer in a political earthquake ending 13 years of leftist rule over Latin America's biggest nation. A nearly 22-hour debate in the Senate closed with an overwhelming 55-22 vote against Brazil's first female president. Pro-impeachment senators broke into applause. Only a simple majority of the 81-member Senate had been required to suspend Rousseff for six months pending judgement on charges that she broke budget accounting laws. A trial could now take months, with a two-thirds majority vote eventually needed to force Rousseff, 68, from office altogether. Within hours, Temer, from the center-right PMDB party, was to take over as interim president, drawing the curtain on more than a decade of dominance by Rousseff's leftist Workers' Party. He was preparing to announce a new government shortly and said his priority is to address Brazil's worst recession in decades and end the paralysis gripping Congress during the battle over Rousseff. A onetime Marxist guerrilla tortured under the country's military dictatorship in the 1970s, Rousseff has denounced the impeachment drive as a coup and vowed to fight on during her trial. She would be officially notified of the vote's result at 10:00 am (1300 GMT) Thursday and would address the nation soon after, Brazilian media reported. A crowd of supporters was planning to gather outside the presidential palace to salute her as she drove off, a spokesman for her Workers' Party told AFP. Due to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in less than three months, Brazil is struggling to stem economic disarray and handle the fallout from a corruption scandal reaching deep into the political and business elite. The latest target of a sprawling probe into the graft was Senator Aecio Neves, who narrowly lost to Rousseff in the 2014 presidential elections and was one of the senators voting to impeach Rousseff. The Supreme Court authorized a probe into his alleged bribe taking and money laundering overnight. The multiple crises have left the country divided between those blaming Rousseff and those loyal to the Workers' Party, whose transformative social programs have lifted tens of millions of people from poverty. Senate President Renan Calheiros, who oversaw the proceedings, told reporters that impeachment would be "traumatic." Divisions were plain to see outside Congress, where police erected a giant metal fence to keep apart small rival groups of demonstrators. Riot police pepper sprayed a group of Rousseff supporters late Wednesday and pro- and anti-impeachment protesters also scuffled briefly in Rio. Senators made their cases in 15-minute blocks, alternately describing Rousseff as the cause of Brazil's humiliating economic decline or defending her as victim of a coup in a deeply corrupt political system. Senator Paulo Paim, a Rousseff ally, conceded that there could be no "miracle" outcome in the Senate vote and that his side would concentrate on saving her during the trial. Magno Malta, a senator from the opposition PR party, said impeachment was the bitter medicine needed to heal a sick country. "As soon as we vote for impeachment, the dollar will fall (against the Brazilian real), our stock market will rise and the patient will breathe again," he said. But even some of those opposing Rousseff doubt that a change of power will resolve the country's underlying problems of corruption and mismanagement. Pro-impeachment protester Sulineide Rodrigues said that even if she wanted Rousseff out, she had few hopes for Temer improving things. "We don't think Temer will be any better," said Rodrigues, 59. "But you know what we'll do? We'll keep coming back and keep having impeachments until there's someone there who listens to us Brazilians."</text>

	<text>JOHANNESBURG: A white South African judge accused of making racist comments has been put on special leave while the incident is investigated, the justice ministry said on Wednesday. High Court Judge Mabel Jansen is reported to have said that in black people's culture "a woman is there to pleasure them. Period," and that she had never met a black girl "who was not raped at about 12". Social activist Gillian Schutte says Jansen made the comments to her during an online conversation. Jansen later said on Twitter: "What I stated confidentially to somebody in a position to help has been taken completely out of context." Many South Africans demanded Jansen be sacked for the comments that once again drew attention to enduring racial tensions more than two decades after white minority rule. "The complaint relates to comments on social media attributed to her which have caused outrage among members of the public," Justice Ministry spokesman Mthunzi Mhaga said in a statement announcing Jansen had been put on leave and a temporary substitute judge had been appointed. The body that oversees appointments to the judiciary said its conduct committee was investigating the incident, a procedure that could lead to her facing a tribunal and, ultimately, impeachment by parliament.</text>

	<text>Amid smoke and tears, the 13-year rule of the Workers Party in the biggest Latin American country virtually came to an end on early Thursday morning as the Senate voted in favour of opening the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, 68, the country's first woman president who won her second term just 18 months ago with more than 54 million votes. With Thursday's vote, the left-wing president temporarily leaves office and power is grabbed by two opposition parties one of which has lost four consecutive presidential elections and the other which has not even contested any of them. The leading figures of both the parties are embroiled in numerous corruption cases. After more than 20 hours of debate that started on Wednesday, 55 senators voted in favour of opening the impeachment against Rousseff and 22 opposed the move. Within hours of the vote, Rousseff was preparing to leave office for 180 days during which her trial will be conducted by the Senate. On Thursday, Brazil's Vice President Michel Temer, a deeply unpopular figure who is infamous for his political machinations and known as the "Butler of horror movies" among his friends and foes, was preparing to take over as the interim president of the country. Dignified and defiant till her last moments in office, Rousseff immediately condemned the Senate's decision. "It is a coup," she wrote on the president's official Facebook page, explaining why the charge of fiscal indiscipline does not make for a "crime of responsibility", the minimum requirement for impeaching the head of state. "Without being able to point out the crime committed, the Senate decided to proceed with the impeachment. It is committing a historical injustice, where procedures such as the right to defense are used to provide legitimacy to a process ripping the Constitution," the president's official page said in her first comments. In a country where corruption is rife, Rousseff is one of those rare politicians who is not accused of any wrongdoing. Even Rousseff's political rivals grudgingly accept that there is no corruption case against her. The impeachment process against Rousseff was opened by Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of lower house, on the basis that in the election year of 2014 she spent more money on social programmes than allocated by the budget. Named in almost all corruption scams plaguing the country, Cunha was himself suspended from his post by the country's Supreme Court last week. A country divided on racial and class lines, the impeachment drama has further deepened the fissures in Brazilian society. While the upper- and middle-classes have been demanding Rousseff's departure from office, she still vast enjoys support among the country's working-class and the poor. In the days leading to the Senate vote, these divisions came to the fore as activists from social movements and unions blocked roads across the country. On Wednesday, as the Senate was debating the impeachment vote, thousands of people supporting and opposing the suspension of the presidents gathered on the lawns in front of the congress in Brasilia. Though divided by a massive make-shift wall, clashes broke out between the two groups during the day. In the national capital, police used tear-gas to disperse a crowd opposed to impeachment. Similar incidents, many of them violent, were reported from other parts of the country, including Rio de Janeiro which has to host the Summer Olympics in 2016. With its economy wobbling and the on-going political crisis almost paralysing the government, tempers have been running high in the country. These tensions are likely to become more intense as Michel Temer temporarily takes power and Rousseff faces the impeachment process in the Senate for the next six months. Though it can be wrapped earlier, Temer, whose popularity is as low as 2%, would like to see the process prolonged so that he can firm up his hold on power. Though out of office for 180 days, Rousseff is still the president of Brazil. She can be removed from the post only after the two-thirds of Senate votes in favour of the motion that she indeed committed a "crime of responsibility". In the 81-member Senate, that figure stands at 54. On Thursday, 55 senators voted in favour of impeachment but several of them said they were only in favour of opening the case and had not yet made a decision on the final vote. This is the second time in 24 years that a Brazilian president has been suspended for trial by the Senate. In October 1992, the Senate had opened the trial of then President Fernando Collor de Mello. But Collor had resigned before being judged by the Senate. Still, he had his political rights suspended by the Senate for eight years. In 2014, the Supreme Court acquitted Collor for lack of evidence.</text>

	<Heading>Japanese welcome Obama to Hiroshima, apology or not</Heading>

	<text>TOKYO: After being taught that atomic bombs are inhumane and terrible, high school student Kaho Matsuki's first reaction when she heard US President Barack Obama would visit the atomic-bombed city of Hiroshima was that he should apologize for America's use of the weapons. But then the Tokyo native remembered her emotional meeting with atomic bomb survivors at a nursing home in Hiroshima, which she visited last year during a school trip to hear their stories. "What struck me most was that those elderly ladies really wanted us to know what they went through so the same mistake would never be repeated, rather than wanting to get (America) to apologize," Matsuki, 17, said Wednesday. Japanese are widely welcoming Obama's decision to become the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, with few public demands for an apology. Even those who want one realize that such a demand would have ruled out a US presidential visit. "Of course everyone wants to hear an apology. Our families were killed," said Hiroshi Shimizu, general secretary of the Hiroshima Confederation of A-Bomb Sufferers Organizations. "However, by setting conditions we limit world leaders from visiting, so we decided to eliminate that," he said in Tokyo. "We would first like for them to come and stand on the grounds of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and take a good look at what is in front of them and give it good thought." Obama will visit Hiroshima with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on May 27, after attending the annual Group of Seven summit in Japan. The city was nearly destroyed by a US atomic bomb on August 6, 1945. Some 140,000 people - mostly civilians - were killed, and others have endured after-effects to this day. The US dropped a second devastating atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki three days later. Japan announced it would surrender on August 15, 1945, ending World War II. A poll released this week by public broadcaster NHK found that 70 per cent of Japanese want Obama to visit Hiroshima, and only 2 per cent were opposed. "I don't live in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, but I am overcome with emotion when I think that someone who wants to offer understanding is finally about to arrive," said Mieko Mori, a 74-year-old woman who stopped at a memorial in Tokyo to pray for the victims. The visit is contentious in the US, where many believe the atomic bombs hastened the end of the war, saving countless other lives, though some historians say the US was eager to use the weapons and Japan would have surrendered soon anyway. The White House went out its way to stress Obama will not apologize. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Tuesday that Obama would "not revisit the decision to use the atomic bomb," and instead spotlight the toll of war and offer a forward-looking vision of a non-nuclear world. Since the bombings, most survivors have chosen to be living testimonies of the horrors of atomic weapons to remind the world to never repeat nuclear war. "It seems there is a consensus that insisting on an apology would be counterproductive," said Chris Winkler, a Hokkaido University professor of Japanese studies. "From the Japanese perspective, it is certainly preferable to have a US president visit Hiroshima even without an apology in his luggage, than him not coming at all." Given the divided US public opinion, an apology demand could have torpedoed Obama's visit, or renewed resentment toward Japan over its mistreatment of American prisoners of war and other sensitive issues, countering government initiatives to strengthen the bilateral alliance, he said. "I hear America is still divided over atomic bombings, but it's been almost 71 years since the war ended, and I think it's about time Obama should be able to visit Hiroshima,'' said Kohachiro Hayashi, a retired teacher who was reading a newspaper at a Tokyo park. Hayashi, 59, said asking for an apology would only cause a fruitless debate over various wartime acts. "We should just accept his visit as a gesture of sincerity," he said. "It's OK as long as he makes clear his commitment never to use atomic weapons. ...I hope he will learn what happened and feel a little bit of it himself while being there." Another retired teacher, Takatsugu Sakamoto, 80, said demanding an apology would be rude. He said that Japan was also trying to develop nuclear weapons but Americans were faster. "Mr. Obama doesn't need to apologize,'" he said. But the praise for Obama could quickly turn into criticism if victims' groups and others don't see concrete steps taken toward further nuclear disarmament, Winkler said. Terumi Tanaka, another senior member of the survivors' association, said his members want Obama to clearly state his intention to eliminate nuclear weapons. "To me, that would be a true form of an apology," he said. "For 70 years we have said this and felt this all along that no one should have to suffer the same thing. Answering to that wish is a true sign of an apology to us."</text>

	<text>Subodh Bhave, the Marathi actor known for his serious performances in movies such as 'Balgandharva' and 'Katyar Kaljat Ghusli', is set to venture into a different territory. He will be playing a psychopath in his next film 'Khel'. "I am bored of social films. I want experiment with other genres as well," he says. Subodh Bhave wins Best Actor Award for 'Balgandharva' 02:34 According to Subodh, he is trying to get out of his comfort zone. "I don't want to stereotype myself. I firmly believe that an actor should always test himself. Therefore, I am playing different kinds of role. You can see me in comic role in 'Kiran Kulkarni vs Kiran Kulkarni'. I had fun playing this role because it gave me a chance to have fun and go crazy while acting. Similarly, I am playing a role of psychopathic villain in my next film. This is again a very different and challenging role because I have to play a person who has split personality," he shares. "These roles are a refreshing break for me from my previous monotonous serious roles," he further adds. -- Anagha.Pathak@timesgroup.com</text>

	<text>Being a celeb means a constant public glare and thus most celeb relations become easy targets of scrutiny. READ: Brian Austin Green seeking spousal support from Megan Fox But there are celebs who have gone a step ahead and kept their exes or spouses under constant watch to keep a tab on their `activities.' The latest to join the bandwagon is Megan Fox, who wants to keep a sharp eye on the activities of her ex-husband Austin Green. Here are few more who did the same: MEGAN FOX ON BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN (2015) While Megan Fox was fighting a custody battle with ex-husband Austin Green, who demanded spouse support on account of his inability to work due to an injury , Megan has decided to keep an eye on his activities since she feels he has been `rather too active' recently to be able to not work, and his claim of inability to work is not true. BEYONCE ON JAY Z (2015) While Beyonce and Jay Z have been together for a long time and all seems fine, there have been reports that Beyonce recently hired a private investigator to keep an eye on Jay while she is away and report back to her on whatever Jay is doing. Sources, reportedly, have spelt trouble in paradise. KHLOE KARDASHIAN ON LAMAR ODOM (2013) Khloe might have been the first one to reach by his side in the hospital after his recent collapse due to drug overdose, but when they were married, Khloe had hired a tail to find evidence against Lamar for cheating on her. And the results were quite what she had expect ed, Lamar was found to have as many as five mistresses. MARIA SHRIVER ON ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (2011) What ended as one of the most expensive divorce settlements between Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, started with Maria hiring a private investigator (PI) to find out how much did Arnold worth and how much money she was dealing with. Arnold's flamboyant spending on his illegitimate family only added fuel to the fire. BRITNEY SPEARS ON KEVIN FEDERLINE (2007) Custody battles can really get dirty, and the same happened with Britney Spears, who hired a private investigator for keeping an eye on Kevin Federline's activities. Britney wanted to use Kevin's unruly behavior as an evidence in the court to get the custody of her children. VENESSA BRYANT ON KOBE BRYANT (2011) It all started in 2003 when Kobe was accused of raping a 19 year old hotel staff, but he refused saying it was `consensual.' Since then Vanessa knew her husband was a cheater, but she wait ed for the right time to hit back. She hired a PI in 2011 to gather enough evidence to file for a divorce and get the right amount of alimony . JUANITA JORDAN ON MICHAEL JORDAN (1988) The legendary basketball player Michael Jordan found himself out of sorts when his long time wife Juanita Vanoy filed for divorce citing `irreconcilable difference.' While the trouble had started long back in their marriage, Juanita hired a PI much later to gether all the right evi dences to win her an amicable divorce.

	<text>Wife of late writer Poornachadra Tejaswi, Rajeshwari Poornachandra Tejaswi, has raised objections against Regional Censor Board, for muting some of the dialogues in the movie Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu, which is the adaptation of the short story penned by her husband Poornachandra Tejaswi. Rajeshwari has reportedly said that people have read the same words in the book which was also retained when it was staged as a play. Dialogues are the soul of the movie; it is disappointing that audiences cannot enjoy those muted words. The film Kiragoorina Gayyaligalu which is currently in theaters has Shwetha Srivatsav, Sukrutha Wagle, Manasa Joshi and Kishore in the lead roles. The project has been directed by D Suman Kittur.</text>

The punch dialogue  which makes it clear that the film is based on the story of a village adopted by Mahesh  indicates the film's plot is inspired from Mahesh's plan to adopt his native village. In February, reports about Mahesh planning to adopt his ancestral village, Burripalem did the rounds. Namrata was quoted as saying, "We are going to work on several small details before proceeding further." While there has been no news of any development about the actor adopting his native village, but the idea seems to have inspired director Koratala Siva enough to come-up with a plot. Atleast that's what the fans of the actor reckon. Here's the teaser of the film:</text>

	<text>Veteran actor Rajeev Mehta, known for his superb role play in TV shows like Khichdi and Baa Bahoo Aur Baby, says that there is a dearth of good writers today when it comes to Gujarati theatre. Mehta, who has been shooting in Vadodara for Kirtan Patel's urban Gujarati flick Bas Ek Chance, says, "There are a few people like Saumya Joshi who are doing commendable work for Gujarati theatre. However, the number is very few and there is a dearth of good writers today, due to which Gujarati plays are suffering. If we get more good writers, I am sure that theatre lovers in the state will show their appreciation for Gujarati plays."</text>

Says Upasna, "I have worked in quite a few Gujarati films in the past, and regional cinema gave me the opportunity to play characters that were vastly different from each other. And I will never forget Amdavad No Rikshawalo, which went on to become a huge hit. I was just 17 when I started shooting for that film and working with Asrani ji was a tremendous learning experience. He is a stalwart when it comes to comedies. So, I feel a very special connection with Gujarat. Besides, being a vegetarian, I have so many options in Gujarat whenever I want to eat out!"</text>

	<text>How would you like to watch the trailer of a movie that is set to be released in 2020? Yes? Okay. Set aside 7 hours and 20 minutes. You read that right. The trailer of Swedish film Ambiance alone is longer than the three Matrix movies combined. Wait. If the trailer alone is about as long as the first four Harry Potter movies, how long is the movie itself? 720 hours. That's a whopping 30 days. And this trailer has been termed a 'short trailer'. The first trailer, which the makers called 'teaser', had been released in 2014, and was 72 minutes long. Another trailer is set to be released in 2018. This, a 'longer' trailer, will be 72 hours long. The trailer does not feature a single cut according to the makers of the film. It is entirely black and white and does not feature a single line of dialogue. And it features only two actors. And here's is the truly eye-popping thing about this movie, according to a note from the fimmakers. "The final film will be screened once syncronised on all the continents and then deleted. Ambiance is 720 hours long (30 days) and will be shown in its full length on a single occasion syncronised in all the continents of the world and then destroyed. Ambiance will be the longest film made that doesn't exist." Ambiance is set to be released on December 31, 2020. It is being directed by Swedish filmmaker Anders Weberg, in what seems to be a goodbye ode to cinema. Incidentally, the longest film ever made is also Swedish. 'Logistics', released in 2012, was 857 hours (35 days and 17 hours) long. Ambiance, when it is released, is set to become the second longest film. Watch the 'short trailer' of Ambiance:</text>

	<text>Sairat Music: Ajay-Atul, Label: Zee Music Rating: 4.5/5 One of the most awaited music albums of the year, Sairat has multiple things to look forward to. For starters, the film's music has been recorded in a big Hollywood studio, making it the first Indian film to do so. Then, Ajay-Atul's compositions are sure to be hits and this one is no different. Going ahead, they've even penned lyrics for the songs. All in all, Ajay-Atul literally own this album with their contribution. Coming to the songs, it's rare to find Marathi music to play in loop today, especially when many producers want composers to ape Bollywood numbers. Sairat's music is one such rarity. It makes you fall in love with the songs from the word go. Listen to Sairat's songs, here: The album opens with Yad Lagla, a romantic track sung by Ajay Gogavale, which starts with a beautiful symphony. Ajay variates from low to high pitch and back with ease throughout the song and one can't get enough of the song despite playing it in repeat mode. Next up, is Shreya Ghoshal's Aatach Baya, picturised on the film's leading lady. Shreya is the musician duo's favourite, essentially because to her voice texture and variation and that's on display in this song. What starts as a calm song turns into a rock anthem soon after. It's a complete composition; you can differentiate the sound of each instrument and Shreya's voice adds more quality to the already great composition. Then comes the love ballad Sairat Jhala Ji, which doubles up as the title track of the film. Ajay and Chinmayi Sripada sing this duet which has a breezy quality to it. For someone who sang the up-tempo Mera naam Mary hai for Ajay-Atul a while ago, Chinmayi adapts fantastically to this serene number. The album closes with what can be called the most popular track of recent times, Zingaat. What a track this is! High on beats, this catchy tune is impossible to stop humming and it's sure to be a hit on the dance floor soon enough. Interestingly, both Ajay and Atul have sung this track and the result is there for all to see. The song has more than 20 lakh hits online. Sairat's music is addictive. Rest assured, if you start your day with these songs, by the end of the day, you would still be listening to them.</text>

	<text>It's incredible what working out for five hours a day, five times a week, for 140 days did to Goutham's perception of himself. From being any regular 29-year-old guy who was conscious of his flabby 78-kg frame, the actor has transformed into a mean machine who isn't shy of wearing just his body. "Oh, it feels great to have a ripped body, more so because I've never been this fit. I weigh 70.5 kg, mostly muscle. Looking at myself after working out, I feel good enough to face the world shirtless," exclaims Goutham, settling down for a chat at a coffee lounge in Jubilee Hills. "Mee cinema eppudu start avuthundi...?" (when will your film shoot start?) enquires the waiter while taking an order for green tea. "Next month," Goutham replies, smiling. "I can't wait to start shooting for it," he adds excitedly, referring to his upcoming film Manu. When returning from a friend's wedding in December last year, director Phani told Goutham that he'd have to go shirtless for a couple of scenes in the film. And that's what motivated him to hit the gym. "I started working out from December 15. We had a shoot on May 3 and I had to get in shape for it," recalls Goutham, who's gotten quite used to counting calories of his meals. Getting a handle over what you eat is the most difficult part of getting in shape, he reckons. "It's only a shade easier than getting the lower abs toned. I've been on a low carb-high protein diet and haven't eaten a single sweet dish all this while. For someone with a sweet tooth like me, it's a lesson in giving up," he remarks, with a smile. Dad Brahmanandam though was just worried about his face. "'Arrey, moham padayipothundi ra...' (your face is losing its charm), dad would remark, after watching me shrink. But after he saw my pictures, he was super excited," shares Goutham, who is playing a painter in the film tipped to be a psychological thriller. "Manu is a very intriguing character. He lives two lives  a hotshot painter by the day who turns into a thief at night," explains the actor, who is confident that this film would prove to be the elusive 'hit.' Box-office success has eluded him since making his debut as a 19-year-old back in 2004. "It was a dream debut for me. I was still in college then and was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Tanikella Bharani, MS Narayana, Sunil, Telangana Sakuntala and my dad. K Raghavendra Rao worked as the directorial supervisor," he recalls. The film was an average grosser, but Goutham got noticed and more importantly, he met wife Jyotsna while working on the film  she is the daughter of the film's cameraman, Srinivas Reddy. "We began seeing each other much later, we were just friends back then," says Goutham. Post his debut, Goutham took a break from showbiz to complete studies. He then went on to train under acting guru Satyanand in Vizag. Unfortunately, his next film, Vah re Vah, turned out to be a disaster. "That was a big mistake. But thanks to my last film Basanti, I managed to get noticed as a performer," explains Goutham's career seems nothing like his illustrious dad's. But Goutham is happy living in the shadow of his great father, who became the first actor to have acted in over 1,000 films. "My dad came from nowhere and did it all himself. He is a phenomenon, and I would be stupid to try and emulate what he did. But hopefully, I will make him proud one day. For now, I'm just focussed on being the best that I can be," he says, signing off.</text>

	<text>Famous Gujarati singer Parthiv Gohil, who has worked on prestigious Bollywood projects like Saawariya and Devdas, has been working on quite a few Gujarati films of late and feels that music in Gujarati films remains a largely unexplored territory. Says Parthiv, "I feel that music in Gujarati films remains a largely untapped market and there is a lot that remains to be explored. In many ways, the musical success of Kevi Rite Jaish was a turning point of sorts and it was really encouraging for the industry. I have been recording for quite a few Gujarati films, and I think the scenario is changing for the better. Makers of Gujarati films are exploring new subjects and even composers are taking up new challenges, which is heartening</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress MP and actor Mithun Chakraborty on Tuesday surrendered to Enforcement Directorate (ED) an amount of about Rs 1.2 crore that he had received from scam-hit Saradha group of companies for being its brand ambassador. Sources said a team of lawyers and other representatives of the actor reached the probe agency's office at Salt Lake here and handed over a Demand Draft (DD) to the investigating officer (IO) of the case. "This was part of Chakraborty's earlier commitment that he would return the funds that he had received from the group. The DD has been given to the IO of the Saradha scam probe case," sources said. READ ALSO: Saradha scam: ED issues fresh summons to Mithun Chakraborty They added that the agency is satisfied with the said action and the statement recorded by the actor-politician regarding his role in the operations of the group, which has now become defunct in the wake of allegations against it of perpetrating a large-scale chit-fund scam in West Bengal and other states. During his last questioning by ED here in May, Chakraborty had provided the agency sleuths with a number of DVDs, CDs and scripts that he had got as part of being the brand ambassador of the Saradha group. The actor had done so to back his claim to investigators that his association with Saradha Group was "purely professional" and that he had no intentions of cheating or duping anyone. "He had told investigators that he had no inkling about any sort of scam that was being perpetrated. The actor had submitted all his personal and official records to the agency in this regard," the sources said. Chakraborty had also promised he would deposit the amount of Rs 1.2 crore he had received from Saradha Group so that it may be finally restored to the depositors who were allegedly cheated in the scam. The Rajya Sabha MP of the ruling party in West Bengal had told ED that he "actually acted in promotional videos and advertisements that were broadcast on television shows" made by the Saradha Group and that was done as per his contract. He told investigators that if he had bad intentions, he would not have undertaken the promotional activity and instead merely stashed the money away. The probe agency had in June last year questioned the actor in Mumbai after it detected that some money had gone into his account from Saradha business portals. ED subsequently summoned him again early this year following which the latest submissions happened. While recording his statement last year, sources said Chakraborty had told investigators that he had "no business dealings" with the now-defunct group which was headed by Sudipta Sen and that he would share all personal transaction details with them. ED sources had earlier said Chakraborty was reportedly sent the said amount for being the brand ambassador of a media platform floated by Saradha Group. The agency had registered a criminal case under PMLA in 2013 and has already questioned a number of people, including sitting MPs and political leaders, in this regard. The agency, till now, has found that a maze of 338 bank accounts and 224 companies were used by the perpetrators of the alleged ponzi scam which duped investors in various states including West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. CBI, probing the case on the directions of Supreme Court, has also filed a chargesheet in a court.</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday stayed the release of multi-crore film 'I', dealing a big blow to Tamil film industry which is still to recover from the commercial failure of Rajinikanth-starrer 'Lingaa'. 'I', featuring Vikram and Amy Jackson and directed by Shankar, was scheduled for release on the Pongal day, January 15. Justice R Mahadevan granted the interim injunction, restraining Aascar Films Private Limited, its directors V Ravichandran and D Ramesh Babu, besides Reliance Mediaworks Ltd, from releasing the film till January 30. The producers, distributors, film laboratories and digital projection services are "hereby restrained by an order of interim injunction till January 30, 2015 from releasing the movie in theatres all over the country, and in any country outside India. In the meanwhile, applicant (Picutrehouse) is directed to initiate arbitration proceedings," the judge said. The judge was passing orders on an application filed by Picturehouse Media Limited, Chetpet, claiming non-performance of commercial and financial agreements between it and Aascar Films. It wanted the matter to be settled by arbitration. While restraining all concerned from releasing the film in any format till January 30, Justice Mahadevan asked the litigating parties to settle the issue by arbitration in the meanwhile. He issued notices to the producers and directed them to file their response by then.</text>

	<text>Allari Naresh tied the knot with Chennai-based architect Virupa at 10 pm on Friday night, amidst beats of mridangam and nadaswaram. Post the thaali kattu ceremony, it was all fun and games, as the newlyweds were seen in their element during the 'talambralu', even as friends and family cheered them on. And almost four hours later, in the post-nupital ceremony where the bride and the groom vie with each other to retrieve a ring dropped in a pot, Allari Naresh had the last laugh. "Both of them played the game very seriously. While Naresh won the first two rounds, Virupa got the ring in the final round... We had so much fun cheering for them," said actor Nani's wife, Anjana, who's a close friend of Naresh. "It's truly a match made in heaven..." "The couple just can't stop blushing..." "They look very much in love..." "They look perfect for each other..."  these were just some of the comments overheard as Naresh and Virupa posed for pictures, took selfies with their friends and greeted their guests. The ceremony came to an end around midnight, soon after Allari Naresh took Virupa outside to show her the 'Arundhati nakshatram'. When Chandrababu Naidu stopped the show, literally... An hour into the ceremony, when Andhra CM, Nara Chandrababu Naidu walked in, along with son Lokesh, the rituals at the mandap had to be paused for few moments to felicitate a quick photo session with the couple. By then, both Naresh and Virupa were seated on either side of the curtain that separates the groom and the bride until the muhurtam; however, the couple made an exception for the chief minister and got up from their seats. And as soon as Chandrababu Naidu left the stage, the rituals proceeded without any further interruption. Later, CBN was seen spending some time mingling with guests at the venue, during which Naresh's elder brother Rajesh introduced his son, Aarav to him. The usually reticent CBN, who's just become a grandfather himself, seemed to be in an indulgent mood as he interacted with the tots who gathered around him. Cell phone-wielding young fans kept celebs on their toes Almost all the celebrities who graced the ceremony were kept busy by kids and youngsters who flocked to them for selfies. As long as there were no bodyguards around, the kids didn't let even a single celebrity go without posing for a selfie! From the wedding hall, to the mandap and even the food counters outside  the young uns were everywhere, ready with their phone cameras and selfie faces!</text>

Recently, Bhoomi Trivedi, who is currently recording a lot of songs for Samir-Mana for a couple of different films, was in their studio, recording for a movie titled Matsar. But their bond is so special that not only did she record the song, the three of them also bonded over a cool jam session for hours. Says Mana Raval, "We have worked with Bhoomi on a lot of projects in the recent past and so it has become very easy for us to bond over music. She's a wonderful girl. We were all a little free after the recording got done surprisingly fast and so went on to do a little singing and music session."</text>

Confirming this, the actor told us, "I have a key role in the movie and my character will be introduced in the beginning itself. I can't reveal much about my role as it is being kept secret." Apart from Kamal, the action-thriller also has Trisha and Prakash Raj in prominent roles. Kishore is looking forward to working with Kamal, who he thinks is a "meticulous actor". "He comes with loads of experience and there is no one like him. I was just a spectator during the discussions that we had about the movie," he says. Kishore is currently busy shooting for Tund Haikal Sahavasa and is expected to join the cast of Thoongavanam in Hyderabad soon. He will shoot for the Tamil movie for the next two months.</text>

	<text>Bolli Movies' Tulu film 'Chandi Kori' that broke-even in 52 days of its release clocked its 100th day on January 2. Enthused by people's continued patronage to his film, director-actor Devdas Kapikad and the entire Bolli Movies team is all set to celebrate this occasion, that a handful of the 60-odd Tulu films released to date have achieved, with a bash scheduled to be held at Town Hall on Monday. All stakeholders of the film will be honoured on this occasion. Devdas told reporters here that the film has been running successfully in Kalpana theatre in Udupi, Suchitra talkies and Big Cinemas in the city for the past 100-days. "Suchitra theatre has been lucky for the production team in that it has helped buck a trend for Tulu films that only those Tulu films released at Jyothi theatre rake in the moolah," he said, adding that the box office at Suchitra had returned record breaking collection thus far with average daily collection of Rs 1 lakh. The film running for 100-days in Kalpana too is a record in that it is the first Tulu film to do so for any theatre in Udupi, he said, adding that Chandrashekar Holla, the exhibitor has confirmed that 68,000 patrons have watched the film in the last 100-days there. "'Chandi Kori' has broken the collection that hit Kannada films such as Mungaru Male and Yajamana brought for Kalpana," he said adding these are good, encouraging signs for the fledgling Tulu film industry. With the film attracting viewers in steady numbers at Big Cinemas even now, 'Chandi Kori' even achieved a record of touching 50-days in a suburban theatre Nataraj at Surathkal, he said. "No Kannada film has achieved this feat in Surathkal," he said adding even though Mangaluru is just 30-minute drive away, people in and around Surathkal have patronized the film in large numbers. This has spurred Bolli Movies to plan its next venture Barsa on a bigger scale, he noted. Incidentally, 'Chandi Kori' has not just been Tulu speaking districts phenomenon. Buttressing this, Devdas said, "A recent screening of the film in London attracted 175 viewers and plans are afoot to organize a second one for those who missed it." Film has been screened in Kuwait, Bahrain, and plans afoot to do so in Dubai, Qatar, Muscat and Australia. Film has done well even in Mumbai despite the limited screens available due to the Marathi first policy there, he said.

	<text>Those who watched Nivin Pauly-starrer Jacobinte Swargarajyam would have noticed a new face among the lead stars, the deep-voiced, formidable looking businessman named Murali Menon who poses a threat to the family in the film. The actor who played the role, Ashwin Kumar, is a well-known mimicry artiste and short film actor, and this is his first role in a full-fledged feature film. Interestingly, Ashwin too is a Dubai-based businessman in real life but he says he is nothing like Murali Menon. "I'm a clown actually, my parents often ask me to start getting serious about life." But this young man is quite serious about cinema, and says the role in Jacobinte Swargarajyam was a dream-come-true for him. "I have to thank director Vineeth Sreenivasan for that, for casting a debutant like me for the character. It was meant to be done by none other than Gautham Menon." So how did he bag the role? "Well, destiny and luck, I would say," says Ashwin. "I was supposed to do just a small role, and I was about to fly to India to attend a very close friend's wedding. At that point, Vineethettan told me, 'Gautham Menon won't be able to come to Dubai as all flights from Chennai are cancelled due to the floods'. I felt bad as I wouldn't be able to meet Gautham, but was wondering why Vineeth was telling me all this. And then he just told me, 'I want you to do the role'. I went numb for a moment," he recalls. "I was in two minds as I couldn't miss my friend's wedding but then, it was Vineeth Sreenivasan who was inviting me. Later that day I found that my flight too had been cancelled owing to the floods. So I won't say I thank the Chennai floods as it was a very unfortunate disaster but it did play a part in my career." Watching Ashwin on screen, one wouldn't think he is a debutant, but the youngster says his experience in short films and stage performances have definitely helped. "I have been acting in short films for seven years and have even directed one. I had no contacts in films, and was in Dubai. All I had was my friends who always encouraged me." What with his mimicry skills, would he do comedy next? "I would love to! But I don't believe in branding roles, all I want to do is situational roles; how people are like in real life." So what is he planning on next? "I'm the heir to the throne to my dad's business; it's our bread and butter, and I have to be here in Dubai. But I hope to strike a decent balance between business and cinema."</text>

	<text>For someone who shifted from doing a Bachelor's degree in science to doing a Masters in Drama, Shaunak's risk taking abilities are commendable. After doing some plays for college fests he has now acted in many plays including popular hit 'Preet Piyu Ne Panetar' and has also written and directed a number of plays. Shaunak found his calling as a theater artiste in college and made the decision to make his passion into his fulltime profession. "Initially it was slightly confusing, but when I realized that if I don't take this step now, I'd be working as a medical representative somewhere, collecting my salary and going home. Theater gave me a platform and made me a known face, I was not just making money but was also becoming famous. Had I been an MR, I'd never have done something I loved. Right then, the decision became easy." So what about the limited finances that Gujarati theater is known to have? "You must believe in yourself and the power of theater, you should be able to believe that doing plays will get you where you want to be, you will earn money and drive a car and live in a big house. To be able to survive in this industry, you should want to be in it badly. That's the only way I know."</text>

	<text>Tamil cinema actor Krishna has been booked under dowry harassment case by all women police station, Thudiyalur here on Thursday. His wife Hemalatha of Mettupalayam claimed that her husband mistreated, manhandled her. Meanwhile, the actor filed a petition before Madras high court, seeking anticipatory bail. READ: ?'Paayum Puli' release stalled Hemalatha told in her complaint that she befriended the actor on Facebook. Later, they fell in love and got married. On February 6, 2014 the marriage was held at Sri Sai Mahal at Mettupalayam. His family members demanded 300 sovereigns of gold ornaments as dowry. But her family members gave 118 sovereigns and told them that they would provide the rest of the sovereigns later. The couple was living in an apartment at Ashoka avenue at Kodambakkam and later the couple was moved to T Nagar. Hemalatha said that she pursued BE (computer science) and was working for a software firm in Chennai. Initially, Krishna bought her a car to commute to her office while later she was asked to travel in bus. Krishna and his parents Sekar alias Kula Senate, film producer and Madhubala allegedly renewed the demand for 300 sovereigns of gold. But her family was unable to fulfill the demand. Hemalatha reported in her complaint that Krishna has extramarital affairs with a few women. She came to know about them and questioned him. Immediately, she was beaten by Krishna, for which she was later admitted to Malar hospital. Meanwhile, Krishna filed a case for divorce in July 2015. The police received the petition and forwarded it to Social welfare department as the petitioner mentioned that she was harassed in the pretext of dowry. Following the petition, Krishna was asked to appear before the officials of social welfare department and police. But he failed to appear and the police inspector Amudha registered a case against Krishna and his parents on Thursday under sections 498(A), 406, 506(i) of IPC and 4 of dowry prohibition act.

	<text>That Prithviraj and Priyadarshan have teamed up for a movie is by itself a big news that Mollywood audience have longed to hear. We have now got wind of the details that the film, scripted by '1983' scribe Bipin Chandran, will go on floors by next year. Actor Manianpilla Raju, who is part of the film, says, "Priyadarshan had bounced off an idea to Prithviraj and he loved it. They are yet to develop the story as Priyadarshan also has another schedule of 'Oppam' with Mohanlal left. Right after that, he would be doing a Bollywood movie with Akshay Kumar." Raju, who will also be funding the film, says that the film will have a schedule in Sri Lanka. "The plan right now is to begin shooting the movie by January next year," says the actor. When we reached out to Priyadarshan, he said it is too soon to discuss the details of the movie as the script is yet to be completed. Meanwhile, Prithviraj is currently busy with the final schedule of Jeethu Joseph's revenge tale Oozham and will join the sets of debutant Jaykrishnan's 'Ezra' by the end of this month.</text>

	<text>Sidharth Bharathan is back in the groove! After making a full recovery from a major car accident in September last year, the actor-director is currently busy finishing the script of his next movie, which will have Jayasurya in the lead. "Jayasurya plays a 36-year-old character named Anil. I can't divulge more about his character right now. Mistaken identity is the basic theme of the movie. It has got comedy; something on the lines of Priyan sir's films," says Sidharth, who had worked as assistant director to Priyadarshan earlier. The filmmaker tells us that though it's a "done-to-death subject", the upcoming movie will have a different take on it. "Even my last film 'Chandrettan Evideya' didn't have a new subject; it was about an extra-marital affair. It's just that our approach was different and that's what worked," he explains. Sidharth adds that he strongly believes in what his late father and veteran director Bharathan had said: 'There are only around 15 basic story subjects which all films revolve around'. So the focus for me is not to come up with a novel subject but to present it in a fresh way." Sidharth has also roped in writer Anand Neelakantan, who has authored books such as Asura - The Tale of the Vanquished, as the co-scriptwriter for the movie. Apart from Jayasurya, the film will have Murali Gopy, Suraj Venjaramoodu and Sidharth's mother KPAC Lalitha. "The rest of the cast is yet to be finalised and we expect to start filming by the end of this year," he informs. The filmmaker says he is also planning to build on the success of 'Chandrettan Evideya'. "The movie gave me an opening to the family audience. While my upcoming movie wouldn't be an out-and-out family entertainer, it would appeal to them as well," says Sidharth.</text>

Said Kher, "More than anything else, it's the state of performing arts that best sums up any city and so, it's crucial that all of us support theatre as much as we can. Plays need to be marketed in a better way and it will certainly help if big actors, who go out of their way to promote films, do the same for plays too."</text>

He added that talks with filmmaker Shankar have been initiated, but it is still not sure when the project will go on the floors. "I recently met Shankar and discussed the possibility of a sequel to 'Indian'. Since he's busy with 'Enthiran 2', the project is unlikely to happen soon," said Rathnam. Shankar-directed 'Indian' featured Kamal Haasan in the title role. It was about a man who takes corruption head on. Asked if the sequel will feature Haasan in the lead, Rathnam said: "It's too early to talk about it." AM Rathnam also said he is planning to bag the theatrical version of Shankar's 'Enthiran 2' with superstar Rajinikanth.</text>

	<text>The Marathi film 'Sairat' has continued its golden run into the third week and is breaking records on its way. The film which collected Rs 25.50 cr in the first week of its release, went on to shatter Marathi BO records with a whopping collection of Rs 41.11 cr at the end of 11 days, according to the entertainment website Bollywood Hungama. Also read: Aamir Khan praises 'Sairat' In doing this, the film has surpassed the earnings of 'Natsamrat', 'Lai Bhaari', 'Duniyadari' and 'Balak Palak'. An interesting aspect to note about this collection figure is that it is much more than many Bollywood big ticket releases this year including 'Rocky Handsome' and 'Jai Gangaajal'. Furthermore, this feat has been achieved by the film in much lesser number of screens. While the Bollywood releases were screened across India, 'Sairat' released across Maharashtra and at a few screens in neighbouring states. The film directed by Nagraj Manjule and featuring Akash Thosar as Parshya and Rinku Rajguru as Archi, has been earning rave reviews for its realistic portrayal of a love story and its BO collection has only added to its success. 'Sairat's run at the BO stands to continue for another week due to no Marathi releases. Next week will be a testing time for the film with the Aishwarya Rai Bachchan-Randeep Hooda starrer 'Sarbjit' scheduled to hit screens. WATCH: 'Yad Lagla' from 'Sairat':</text>

According to a statement from the makers, "Captain America: Civil War" collected Rs.9.81 crore on Sunday with a growth of 10 percent over Saturday. The cumulative total so far is Rs.27.13 crore.

	<text>Actress Kranti Redkar has turned into an identity thief for her upcoming movie 'Kiran Kulkarni Vs Kiran Kulkarni'. When asked about whose identity she would like to steal in real life, she replied, "I would love to steal the identity of Priyanka Chopra." Kranti is in awe of Piggy Chops' success in Bollywood as well Hollywood. "She is really doing well for herself and I am really happy for her. What she has achieved as an Indian actress is impressive therefore, given a choice, I would like to be her," says Kranti. Also read: Kranti turns stunt-girl for next However, in reality Kranti feels that cyber crime and identity theft are scary issues. "I have experienced these kinds of issues. Someone quoted me when I was not even present at the event and then the whole onus fell onto me. It was really troublesome," she shares. Talking about the film, which also features Subodh Bhave and Mohan Joshi, she adds, "It's great that a film has been done on cyber crime. My character in the film has lot of shades. It was not an easy role to play. You hate my character, you love her, she makes you laugh and within no time she makes you cry as well. The character is irritating at times, and sometimes you feel sympathetic to her. The role was truly demanding." -- Anagha.Pathak@timesgroup.com</text>

	<text>With the schools closed for vacation, it seems that Mollywood has opened the doors for more movies with children playing the pivotal characters. Already three movies are under production with kids in central roles  Kunchacko Boban's 'School Bus', an upcoming Sunny Wayn film and Tovino Thomas' 'Guppy'. The latest to join the bandwagon is Kalavoor Ravikumar's 'Kuttikalundu Sookshikuka'. While the movie has Anoop Menon and Bhavana as part of the cast, it's Jo and the Boy star Sanoop Santhosh and Balaganapathy fame Siddharth Ajithkumar who play the central roles. "Their characters set off the plot with a particular incident," Ravikumar says.However, he adds that it is not a children's movie. "While it has its series of fun and feel-good moments, it evolves into a thriller." Of late, Mollywood has had several such films that have schoolchildren as key characters in spite of having superstars such as Mammootty, Nayanthara and Manju Warrier as part of the cast. Here are some such movies: Jo and the Boy The movie was billed as a children's film starring Manju Warrier. But it turned out to be an inspirational film about not giving up on one's dreams, no matter one's age. Sanoop's character provides the inspiration for Manju to accomplish her dream of becoming a renowned animator. Malgudi Days The film was inspired by a real-life incident in Nagaland about two school children, played by Janaki Menon and Vishal Krishna, who get trapped in the school campus. The movie also has Anoop Menon and Bhamaa, but it was the two kids who made the maximum screen time with eight-year-old Janaki winning a State Award for her performance in the movie. Ben The Vipin Atley movie, which was based on true incidents, was about kids but was definitely not a children's film. It told the tale of a mom and son, and how unrealistic expectations take a toll on the child physically and mentally. While Anjali Upasana, who played the mother, won a State Award for her performance, Gaurav Menon as Ben clinched the National and State Awards for the Best Child Artiste. School Bus The film, based on real-life events, is scripted by Bobby-Sanjay duo and directed by Rosshan Andrrews. It also has Kunchacko Boban and Jayasurya as part of the cast. Despite the heavyweights, the movie is told from the point of view of two kids and through them, the audience gets a peek in to the adults' world. The film reportedly is about a child-missing case, which Kunchacko's cop character investigates. Bhaskar the Rascal The movie has two superstars of the South  Mammootty and Nayanthara  but it was two child artistes who played the key roles in bringing the lead characters together. The former plays a widower while Nayanthara essays an estranged wife. Their children are schoolmates and their friendship leads to their parents becoming close.' Jilebi The movie showcased the clash of lifestyles between Jayasurya's rustic character and his Dubai-bred nephews. The kids played the central role in the movie that emphasised on the fact that one should value relationships over a person's financial status. Guppy The film has Tovino Thomas playing a civil engineer who comes to town to supervise the construction of a bridge. However, the central character is a 14-year-old boy, who makes a living by rearing and selling aquarium fish. Sunny Wayn's upcoming movie The upcoming film has Deiva Thirumagal fame Sarah Arjun playing a six-year-old school kid named Ann Maria. Sunny Wayn will be seen as a rustic youth, who enters her life by accident. How the two influence each other's lives forms the plot of this feel-good movie.</text>

	<text>Shivarajkumar's latest release Belli will be trimmer by 13 minutes from today. The film released last week and was 140 minutes long. The Mussanje Mahesh directed film is now shorter after audience feedback that some of the scenes were not effective due to their length. It is not uncommon for films to be trimmed after release. However, they have to go through the process of getting permission from the Censor Board even for deleting any scene. Recently films like Ninnindale and Ulidavaru Kandante were trimmed after release. Ninnidale lost as much as 18 minutes while Ulidavaru Kandante lost 12 minutes. There were some some exchange of words between Ulidavaru Kandante director Rakshit Shetty and producer Suni with the former accusing of trimming the film without informing the former. But the real trouble was for the film Adyaksha. There were objections to a song in the film about Lord Krishna. The Censor Board, however, did not find anything wrong and allowed the song in full. However bowing to pressure from a caste group, a portion of the song was deleted.</text>

	<text>Security at the electronic dance music (EDM) festivals Sunburn and the Supersonic held annually in Goa, will be heightened in view of a terror threat posed by extremist groups like the Islamic State (IS), Tourism Minister Dilip Parulekar said. ?ALSO READ: Goa govt yet to give nod to 'Sunburn', 'Supersonic' festivals Speaking to IANS on the sidelines of a media event at the state Secretariat on Wednesday, Parulekar also said that permissions for the two events were held in abeyance, until the organisers complied with requests for providing additional security cover."We want the best security in view of the IS threat. The single window permission committee headed by the chief secretary, which grants permission for such events has decided to ask the organisers of the events to increase security on site," Parulekar said. Chief Secretary of Goa, R.K. Srivastava heads the committee which grants single window clearance to major tourism related events organised in the state. Parulekar also said that some of the specific requests which have been made by the committee includes increasing the number of metal detectors at the EDM festival venues and sniffer dogs to keep track of possible explosive substances. "The police will be there, but the organisers will also have to increase the security in view of the threat. The permissions will be granted once they comply with these conditions," Parulekar said. Goa, one of the top beach and nightlife tourism destinations, hosts two of the biggest party events in the country namely Sunburn and Supersonic EDM festival which are held in the last week of December, which coincides with peak tourism season.</text>

One more movie has been added to the list and it will be helmed by Ordinary director Sugeeth and scripted by Benny P Nayarambalam. The 'Welcome to Central Jail' scribe tells us, "We had an initial discussion and Mammukka was pleased with the storyline. I cannot reveal much because we are yet to develop it into a full-fledged script. Also, the project will go on floors only by late next year." Incidentally, Benny is also scripting another Mammootty-starrer, which will be directed by debutant Saji and the shooting will start by August this year.

	<text>Over the past few months we have heard of Marathi filmmakers and actors making it big with international offers. Well, it is understood then that actors and filmmakers from the other side will be happy to be seen in Marathi films too. One such example is Paula McGlynn. Paula, who hails from Vancouver, Canada, will be making her debut in Marathi films with fashion photographer turned filmmaker Prashant Patil's 'Pindadaan'. We speak to her about her journey from Canada to Pune and her future plans. Excerpts from an interview: Why did you choose to make a debut in a Marathi film? I came to India three years ago with an aim to make a career in the film industry. 'Pindadaan' came to me through a friend's friend, who was casting for the film. He thought I would fit the role perfectly. This is how I selected my first film as a lead. For me, it has never been about the language. It has always been about the right character, project and working with the right people. I am immersed in Marathi culture owing to a strong friend's circle and business partners who are Maharashtrians. So, my debut in a Marathi film is obvious. What about your character Ana appealed to you? The first thing I liked about this project that it is a unique opportunity for a non-Indian to play a character with so much depth and importance in a regional film. Ana is a complex character. The message and soul of the film was intriguing and I wanted to explore this aspect of it. You have been actively involved in various aspects of film making. Did it help you perform better as an actor? I believe the most important aspect for an actor is to get in touch with the character. One needs to mould into the character and believe in it. Secondly, you have to trust your director and have faith in his sketch. Prashant and the team have been extremely helpful with all of this. Yes, understanding the nuances of filmmaking helps when it comes to lighting and other effects. How fluent are you with Marathi? My character Ana is from England who comes to stay in Maharashtra. She falls in love and becomes one with the land and culture. My friend Rinki helped me with the language. She literally coached me. The script was in Devnagari so I learnt to write and speak the language. Siddharth Chandekar and Manava Naik helped me with my lines and made me feel comfortable on sets. I insisted on learning the language so that I could get the emotions right. It took me a month to get my dialogues in place.</text>

	<text>Just a couple of weeks post the release of 'Sairat', director Nagraj Manjule has been caught in the midst of a controversy. The filmmaker is currently the toast of the film industry post the smashing success of the recently released film, but an old legal case has come back to haunt him. According to sources, Nagraj's ex-wife Sunita is planning to reopen the lawsuit that led to their divorce a couple of years ago, with the hope of 'securing justice'. Speaking to us about the same, Sunita's cousin, Sagar Lashkare, informed, "They got married when he was in class XII and for 15 years, my sister was by his side through thick and thin. After turning director, Nagraj hardly ever visited his hometown and whenever he did, he never spoke to her." In 2012, a divorce suit was filed which came through in 2014, according to Lashkare. "Post the decision, he gave an amount of `6-7 lakh to us and had assured that he would give more as and when needed. That never happened. Today, he's a star director, earning in crores but not once did he think about ruining my sister's life. We don't want money or anything else. We only demand justice and that is why we want to reopen the case," added Lashkare. Akash Painter, a social worker from Pune, also tried to settle the matter amicably a few years ago. "When the lady came to us with her complaint, I called up Nagraj and asked him to meet me in Pune to sort out the matter. He agreed but never came. After that the matter went to court," said Painter. We tried contacting Nagraj but he wasn't available for comment till the time of going to press. (Inputs by Shashank.Sane@timesgroup.com) *This is an updated version of the story.

	<text>Be it thrillers, romance or drama, Sandalwood viewers are in for a treat, as there are quite a few sequels in the pipeline in Sandalwood. While some of these star the same actors as the originals, others have newer, younger faces in the sequels that are underway. This year already saw Uppi 2, the sequel to director-actor Upendra's earlier self-titled film, albeit with some new faces added to the cast. Among those underway, we have Mungaru Male 2, which has the same hero, but a different director and heroine. Ganesh romances newbie Neha Shetty, with Shashank directing the new film. The 2011 hit Rajdhani, which was one of the early hits in Yash's career, is having a sequel with an all-new cast. Hariprriya is the heroine, opposite Preetham as her hero. Director Suni is currently completing the sequel to his film Simplag Ondu Love Story, which has been titled Simplag Innondu Love Story. The film stars TV actor Praveen and Meghana Gaonkar in lead roles. Kalpana, which was a remake of the Tamil film Kanchana, will have a sequel too. While there was a Muni 3 that was made after Kanchana, we wonder if that will be the subject of Kalpana 2. Also currently in the works is director-actor Kishan's sequel to his C/O Footpath, titled Care of Footpath 2. The film, to be released in Hindi and Telugu as well, has an ensemble cast of many known faces and stars Bollywood director Anees Bazmee and actress Esha Deol. Other sequels that have been announced so far include Ayya 2, Huccha 2 and Dandupalya 2, which have been greenlit quite a while ago, but are still in different stages of production. Both the Ayya and Huccha sequels have younger heroes replacing the original cast. Chiranjeevi Sarja will be seen in Ayya 2, while Dhananjaya was roped in to be in Huccha 2. Among the newer ones that will go on floors, Suri's recently released Manvitha- and Vicky-starrer will have both a part 1 and part 2 releasing, given that the film that hit screens was a part 2 itself. The Sriimurali-starrer Ugramm will have a sequel titled Ugramm Veeram. Certain scenes in KM Chaitanya's Aatagara also suggest that it might have a sequel, but the makers haven't confirmed anything. There has been talk about a sequel to the Yash- and Kriti Kharbanda-starrer-Googly and the Ramya- and Srinagara Kitty-starrer Sanju Weds Geetha, but we haven't heard from the makers after initial speculation and discussions about the projects.</text>

	<text>Mr and Mrs Ramachari is Yash and Radhika Pandit's third film together so far. The first two being Moggina Manasu in 2008, and Drama in 2012. Ramachari, the character portrayed by Yash in the film, is said to be inspired by the character of the same name portrayed by Vishnuvardhan in his 1972 film Naagarahaavu. Yash, in the film, sports a tattoo of that character on his chest, played by Vishnuvardhan, and plays the role of a fan of the character. Just like the character of Ramachari in Naagarahaavu, Yash too plays a rebel who is short-tempered. He is also a great fan of Ramachari and is inspired by him. Watch the trailer of Mr and Mrs Ramachari here.</text>

	<text>It seems that Mammootty already has projects lined up for the better part of 2017. One more movie has been added to the list and it will be helmed by Ordinary director Sugeeth and scripted by Benny P Nayarambalam. The 'Welcome to Central Jail' scribe tells us, "We had an initial discussion and Mammukka was pleased with the storyline. I cannot reveal much because we are yet to develop it into a full-fledged script. Also, the project will go on floors only by late next year." Incidentally, Benny is also scripting another Mammootty-starrer, which will be directed by debutant Saji and the shooting will start by August this year. "He will be seen in three different roles in the movie," says the 'Chotta Mumbai' scribe, adding that the film will be an entertainer. Meanwhile, Mammootty is currently filming in Kottayam for his movie 'Thoppil Joppan'. The film has the actor playing a Kabaddi enthusiast and follows his life in two timelines. While Andrea Jeremiah has already been cast to play his romantic interest in one phase of his life, it's rumoured that the team is in discussions with Mamta Mohandas to essay the other female lead in the Johny Anthony directorial.</text>

	<text>All roads led to Shilpakala Vedika on Thursday. You might be sniggering at that cliche but that was the reality, so much that choc-a-block traffic even got the performing artistes of the Times of India Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival a bit delayed. Nevertheless, once the music began all pressures of the outside world were laid to rest as Dr L Subramaniam picked up his bow to play violin and conduct the amalgamation of the seven percussionists from across the country. In the first half of the show, the women of the family took the stage. Bindu's Let there be love and peace...  a perfect balm for today's fractured world was followed by Kavita Krishnamurti's, who took to stage amid applause and prayed for musical avenues beyond movies in her life as she sang a bhajan. However, she did perform her iconic film numbers  from 1941, a Love Story and Bombay. Then arrived the father and son duo (Dr L Subramaniam and Ambi), who performed in beautiful symphony a composition made to commemorate the 40 years of Indian Independence and performed at the United Nations, New York. But the audiences who were already in the trance had no idea what was going to come their way in the second half, following a small break. What followed next was a energetic second half that began with electrifying guitars for the track Time is right and then the highlight of the evening  the percussion symphony. "We are first going to try it on you and see your reaction and decide if we want to play it in other cities," quipped Dr Subramaniam, who walked up and down the stage at complete ease  as if the violin was a natural extension of his body and soul. Of course, the mesmerising symphony was received with loud applause  Hyderabad had not just liked it but loved it. The final piece had everyone from the Subramaniam family on stage  Kavita, Bindu, Ambi and even Dr Sumbramaniam's three-and-half-year-old granddaughter Mahati, who was welcomed on the stage with "awwwws" from the audience. As they sang, together and Subramaniam involved the percussionists on the stage in a playful juglabandi, one could picturise an average day in the Subramaniam household being full of beautiful music and symphony. After taking out time to talk to his fans at the end of the show, Dr Subramaniam, elated by Hyderabad's response, says, "Yea, most people jokingly say we are the Subramaniam gharana." And Hyderabad sure loved being part of the family.</text>

	<text>The brief, chaotic life of Bobbi Kristina Brown was never really her own. Born and raised in the shadow of fame and litigation, shattered by the loss of her mother, Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina was overwhelmed by the achievements and demons of others before she could begin to figure out who she was. Her demise was the most awful inheritance of all. Bobbi Kristina passed away on Sunday at Peachtree Christian Hospice in Duluth, Georgia, about six months after she was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub in the suburban Atlanta townhome she shared with Nick Gordon, the man she called her husband. She was 22-years-old. Bobbi Kristina Brown passed away July, 26 2015, surrounded by her family. She is finally at peace in the arms of God. We want to again thank everyone for their tremendous amount of love and support during these last few months,'' Kristen Foster, a representative for the Houston family said Sunday. For latest Music updates, follow us on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt;@TOIEntertain For the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook &gt;&gt;&gt;TOIEntertain Police said she was found Jan. 31 in the suburban Atlanta townhome she shared with Gordon. A police report described it as a "drowning.'' READ: No progress in comatose Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition Bobbi Kristina was the only child between Houston and Brown. She was hospitalized for months in Atlanta eventually being placed in hospice care after being found in a manner grimly similar to the way her megastar mother died three years earlier. The police report called it a "drowning,'' and Gordon said at the time it seemed she wasn't breathing and lacked a pulse before help arrived. Brown _ the sole heir of her mother's estate _ did have dreams. She identified herself on Twitter as "Daughter of Queen WH,'' "Entertainer/Actress'' with William Morris &amp; Co., and "LAST of a dying breed.'' She told Oprah shortly after her mother's death in 2012 that she wanted to carry on her mother's legacy by singing, acting and dancing. But her career never took off. Actor and producer Tyler Perry said she had a future as an actress after her debut on his TV show "For Better or Worse'' in 2012, but she only appeared in one episode. Aside from two ill-fated reality TV shows and the occasional paparazzi video, her image mostly showed up in the "selfies'' she posted online. She attended award shows and appeared on red carpets with her mother and father. She performed a duet on TV with her mother in 2009, singing "My Love Is Your Love'' in New York's Central Park. She became social media sensation, sending more than 11,000 tweets and attracting 164,000 followers. But Whitney Houston, known as "America's Sweetheart,'' was an impossible act to follow. The late singer sold more than 50 million records in the United States alone during her career. Her voice, an ideal blend of power, grace and beauty, made classics out of songs like "Saving All My Love For You,'' "I Will Always Love You'' and "The Greatest Love of All.'' She earned six Grammys and starred in the films "The Bodyguard'' and "The Preacher's Wife.'' Bobby Brown had a bad-boy image but also became a huge star, selling platinum records with New Edition and going solo before drugs and legal woes derailed his career. Bobbi Kristina appeared alongside both parents in 2005 on the Bravo reality show "Being Bobby Brown,'' which captured her parents fighting, swearing and appearing in court. The Hollywood Reporter said it revealed that Brown was "even more vulgar than the tabloids suggest,'' and managed "to rob Houston of any last shreds of dignity.'' Years earlier, as Houston was preparing to give birth to Bobbi Kristina, she expressly left Bobby Brown out of her will, putting everything in a trust "for the benefit of her children and more remote descendants,'' according to the Houstons' 2012 petition. For more interesting Music news and pictures, follow us on Pinterest&gt;&gt;&gt; timesofindia For latest Music updates, follow us on G+ &gt;&gt;&gt; The Times of India Entertainment After their divorce in 2007, Houston kept custody of Bobbi Kristina and raised her alongside Gordon, an orphan three years older than her daughter. Houston brought Gordon into her family, and while she never formally adopted him or included him in the will, both teenagers called her "mom.'' The threesome's tight bond was shattered when Houston's assistant found the singer's lifeless body face-down in a foot of water in her bathtub at the Beverly Hills Hotel just before the Grammy Awards in 2012. Authorities found prescription drugs in the suite, and evidence of heart disease and cocaine in her body, but determined that it was an accidental drowning. Bobbi Kristina, then 18, was at the hotel and became so hysterical she had to be hospitalized. "She wasn't only a mother, she was a best friend,'' she told Oprah Winfrey. She and Gordon then went public with their romance, posting defiant messages online after the tabloids accused them of incest. The Houstons tolerated their relationship, appearing with them on television that year in Lifetime's reality show "The Houstons: On Our Own.'' But in one telling episode, the late singer's relatives lectured the pair about drinking after they show up in an obviously altered state, and accuse Gordon of failing to take care of the grieving girl. Relations between Gordon and some other relatives continued to sour over the past year after Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized. A protective order barred him from being within 200 feet of Pat Houston, Bobbi Kristina's aunt. A feud erupted over whether Gordon could visit Bobbi Kristina while she stayed in the hospital. On June 24, Bobbi Kristina's court-appointed representative sued Gordon, accusing him of misrepresenting his relationship with Bobbi Kristina. The complaint accused him of being violent toward her and taking more than $11,000 from her account while she was in a medically induced coma after the Jan. 31 tragedy. The lawsuit accused Gordon of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment and conversion. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he and his office are interested in reviewing the investigative file to determine whether any charges will be filed. Also on June 24, Pat Houston said Bobbi Kristina had been placed in hospice care. Bobbi Kristina was fabulously wealthy for a teenager, but her money was in a spendthrift trust, designed to keep creditors and predators from taking advantage of people who can't manage their money. Bobbi Kristina's grandmother, Cissy Houston, and aunt, Pat Houston, eventually took over control of the trust and then took Bobbi Kristina to court to protect the estate. The Houstons called Bobbi Kristina "a highly visible target for those who would exercise undue influence over her inheritance and/or seek to benefit from (her) resources and celebrity,'' and urged a judge to delay how quickly she could control the money. Bobbi Kristina agreed to the delay, and the judge granted their request to seal the case. The size of Houston's estate is a privately held secret. In May, a judge appointed Bobby Brown and Pat Houston as co-guardians of Bobbi Kristina, giving them joint responsibility in decisions related to her care and medical needs. Lawyer Bedelia Hargrove was appointed conservator to oversee Bobbi Kristina's assets, including her rights and legal claims. Houston signed a $100 million record deal in 2001, but failed to deliver, and lost two homes to foreclosure toward the end of her life. But her early death revived a hunger for her music, and her name and likeness generated revenue that became part of Bobbi Kristina's inheritance. By January 2014, the young couple who grew up as brother and sister were sharing a townhome in Roswell, Georgia, and calling themselves husband and wife. They posted images of their hands wearing wedding rings, with the caption "(hash)HappilyMarried. So (hash)InLove. If you didn't get it the first time that is.'' They got identical "WH'' tattoos with flying doves on their wrists, and Gordon added a large portrait of Houston's face on his arm. Their marriage announcement troubled Pat Houston, who obtained a restraining order against Gordon two months later. "Damn, lol, it's incredible how the world will judge you 4ANY&amp;EVERYthing,'' Bobbi Kristina tweeted at the time. By last September, Pat Houston said she was "very proud of Krissy.'' "Young people today are up against so much with social media and everything else that presents itself to them,'' Pat Houston told The Associated Press. "We try to be there for her, just to try to guide and direct her.'' Judging from her postings online, Bobbi Kristina was focused on the approaching anniversary of her mother's death. In one of her last tweets, she said, "Littlelady&amp;yourgrowing young man (at)nickdgordon miss you mommy ..:') SOmuch.. loving you more every sec. (hash)Anniversary!''

He has decided to adopt Siddhapuram village of Kottur mandal in backward Mahbubnagar district. READ: Mahesh Babu gifts Audi A6 to Srimanthudu director Mahesh Babu said he decided on the village 'after much thought' discussing it with IT minister K T Rama Rao. "After much thought, KTR garu and myself have chosen to adopt Siddhapuram village of Kottur mandal in Mahbubnagar district. Looking forward to a constructive and meaningful journey ahead," he said on his Twitter. The star adopting a village for its development has been on the cards for now. Actor Prakash Raj also recently adopted a village in Mahbubnagar district. However, Mahesh Babu earlier had also adopted a village in Andhra Pradesh. He adopted Burripalem village in Guntur districts. While the local authorities will help in drawing up plans for the overall development of the village, the funding will have to be provided by the star. This is an initiative of both the Telangana and AP governments which want prominent people to adopt villages and change their complete face in order to provide them better facilities.</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: Income Tax officials raided the premises of actors Vijay, Nayantara and Samantha, and producers and financiers of the Tamil movie "Puli" on Wednesday morning in connection with alleged tax evasion.

	<text>Beards are in vogue in Mollywood! After Nivin Pauly and Dulquer Salmaan took the industry by storm last year with their rugged looks in 'Premam' and 'Charlie' respectively, it's now Dhyan Sreenivasan's turn. From the chocolate boy image to the stubble avatar, the 'Adi Kapiyare Kootamani' actor has undergone a drastic makeover for his upcoming movie 'Ore Mugham'. The snaps of the actor sporting a thick beard and moustache with a brooding countenance have already gone viral. The film's director Sajith Jagadnandan tells us the story is set in two timelines. "Dhyan will be seen in two different getups. His campus life is set in the 80s and that's when he will be sporting the gruff avatar with the beard. For the latter portions set in the current era, he will have a totally different appearance," he says. Dhyan plays Zacharias Pothen in the film. "He's a campus leader of sorts, who has the final say in whatever happens in the college. His character also has a grey shade and hence the rugged look," explains Sajith. The movie centres on the life of four friends - played by Dhyan, Aju Varghese, Prayaga Martin and Gayathri Suresh. Amala Paul will also be seen in a pivotal role in the movie.</text>

	<text>Naishadh Purani, the director of much talked about play Taap is taking life easy and enjoying himself after the successful staging of this play. The play that was staged at Natrani was quite a talked about. When we asked Naishadh about his experience with the play, he shares, "When I was in the process of thinking about the subject of the play, I was in two minds whether to make one on serious-intense topic or to come up with a comedy one. Ultimately, I chose this topic of exploitation of women in different social circles as well as age groups. It is a burning issue and to deal with this play carefully was much needed." He goes on to add, "I'm happy with the feedback I have received. People were convinced with the idea." Naishadh is also brainstorming currently for his next theatre work. But usually most Gujarati audience prefer comedy as a genre when it comes to theatre. What does Naishadh think about it? "Commercially, people still opt for a comedy play in Gujarati. But, now I strongly feel any theatre work which has a good content and execution is accepted by audience. Also, social networking has been a boon for all the artists like us as we can get better understanding and involvement from audience." In the meanwhile, team Taap is all set to travel across country for more shows.</text>

	<text>Lavanya Tripathi just can't seem to stop herself from breaking into a guffaw when talking about her upcoming rom-com Bhale Bhale Magadivoi. "This is my first romantic comedy and I've never had as much fun as I did on the sets of this film. In fact, I had tears of joy just listening to director Maruthi narrate the script. I was literally rolling on the floor laughing," says a visibly excited Lavanya. Admittedly, her co-star Nani and director Maruthi would constantly tell Lavanya to stop laughing. "Whenever a scene was discussed or being shot, I used to imagine how it would translate on to the screen and a movie would run in front of my eyes and I would immediately burst out laughing. Nani and Maruthi would say, 'You are giving us over confidence. You laugh on everything and we think we are doing it so well. Hopefully it's not just you who finds it funny.' But my laughter was genuine and I think it will be like that for everyone who watches it," shared Lavanya, adding "I am very happy with the way it has shaped up. So my excitement is pretty obvious." The actress fondly recalls her experience of working with Nani, with whom she is teaming up with for the first time, saying, "I always wanted to work with Nani. So this opportunity was a great one. Despite being around for over six years now, it's incredible how he still is like a newcomer on the sets. Nani is a consummate actor and is very keen about his work and puts in extra effort into every single shot. He is very spontaneous too," says the actress who learnt Kuchipudi for this film. Lavanya plays a classical dancer in the movie, but her favourite song though is a beach song, Hello Hello. "We were shooting for it and the same day it started raining. It was apparently the first rain of Goa. I just love rain and the choreographer asked me to just go and enjoy myself and do what I like. I had a really fun time. Nani was forced to join me because I couldn't be in the shot all alone!" recalls Lavanya who happened to run into a childhood friend when shooting in Goa. "She was my friend in college and it was such a proud moment for her to see me working. She had seen me as a kid and now like this shooting and all. It was overwhelming," recalls Lavanya, who confesses to missing shooting for the film. "Every moment on the sets was so much fun. Frankly, I miss the whole crew because we had become friends. It is a thing which happens after every film but this time the film being a funny one, we laughed so often that the memories will remain sweet ones," she says signing off. Bhale Bhale Magadivoi, produced by Bunny Vas and presented by Allu Aravind under Geetha Arts, UV Creations banner, is releasing on Sep 4.</text>

The actor took to his social networking page to convey the news to his fans, with a pic of him in China. "I'm in the midst of world trip, and not in a position to pen my thoughts. I am taking a break this month. Will catch you all for sure here in this space, next month," he posted, along with a pic of his wife and friends. Mohanlal has religiously posted a blog on the 21st of every month and covered several issues including the JNU student activism and Kerala stray dog menace.</text>

	<text>DJ Indra J, Vadodara's most well-known DJ, has often said that Vadodara is ahead of other cities in Gujarat when it comes to reception towards electronic dance music (EDM). And it was pretty evident when Sunburn Reload, a mini version of the immensely popular Sunburn music festival held in Goa, was held at Sevasi recently. Barodians had been waiting for this event with bated breath and the wait proved to be worth it. Indra J, Anish Sood and Piyush Bhatnagar (who is popularly known as Sound Avtar), the three artists for the evening, were in fine form throughout the evening and the young crowd had a fantastic experience.</text>

At a recent shindig hosted by Shail and Deepa Gupta, giggles and kisses in the air did the rounds, as good music kept the feel-good atmosphere going. It was a perfect evening of music, song and dance that saw ladies dressed in their party best. The P3Ps were also seen shaking a leg and crooning during karaoke time.

In a recent interview, she said that if the script is impressive, she has no problems with showing skin show. Her body features and looks have acquired a special place in the audience's hearts. In the films she has acted so far, her hot and sexy avatar has managed to rule hearts. Something similar is expected from her in Hum Hai Jodi No. 1. During another interaction, Poonam said that it is her duty to respect the admiration people have showered on her. But this is not all. Apart from her looks, the audience has also shown a liking towards her films.</text>

	<text>Does the name Anjana Sukhani ring a bell? Yes, she's the girl who had Anil Kapoor drooling as she danced to Babuji dheere chalna in 'Salaam-E-Ishq'. Almost nine years after that film, Anjana is experimenting with another ishq, this time a risky and passionate one. The actress is making her Marathi film debut opposite Swwapnil Joshi in the upcoming Laal Ishq. In a chat with us, Anjana shares how she landed the role, her non-filmi roots and personal space. Excerpts: After Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Punjabi films, 'Laal Ishq' marks your Marathi debut. Tell us how things fell in place. Frankly, it was a cakewalk for me. I got a call from Sanjay Leela Bhansali's office (he's producing the film) and was asked to come down for an interaction. I met the director Swapna Waghmare-Joshi there, the team told me the story of the film and asked if I would like a narration. I said yes and the next thing I know, I was on board. Also read: Anjana is Bhansali's new heroine What is your character Janhavi like, in the film? It is not even close to my real self. Janhavi is honest but has shades of grey. It is a layered character and unlike anything I have done before. Playing Janhavi was emotionally draining for me. Firstly, I understand Marathi but speaking it in front of hundreds of people is not something I was comfortable with. So, getting the pronunciations, emotions and body-language right in a single scene was a task but credit goes to Swwapnil and Swapna tai for bringing out the best in me. Having said this, the role lifted me as an actor. Since you've worked in five different languages, according to you, where does regional cinema stand when compared to Bollywood? I won't really compare the two. Each film industry has its unique identity, stage, audience and practices. But I have grown personally and professionally whilst working in these industries; each film has been an enriching experience. For a love story, you have to have a certain rapport with your co-star. With this being your first pairing with Swwapnil and also your first Marathi outing, how did you ensure to get the scenes right? Swwapnil is a very humble human being. That made things easy and it didn't even take a week for us to break the ice. Plus, all of us were meeting daily and that ensured we got along soon. But was it difficult shooting the intimate scenes? No matter how much one denies it, there is always some hesitance when shooting an intimate scene. But an actor needs to shed inhibitions to look convincing. I follow a simple mantra - 'Do whatever it takes to get the shot right at the first go, instead of doing the same thing 40 times'. Was it difficult for you to make a mark in the film industry without a filmy background or any backing? I won't say it's difficult but you need to have determination to get where you want to. You are standing in a queue and you know there are thousands of girls standing behind you. Your number will come if you stay put but if you leave the queue, that's the end of it. Adhyayan Suman, your co-star from 'Jashn', is in the middle of the Hrithik-Kangana issue nowadays... All I want to say about this is that it's a very personal thing, what they are going through and washing dirty linen in public is wrong. Find out: Why Hrithik-Kangana's alleged affair got ugly Till date, you were recognised as Anjana from 'Salaam-E-Ishq'. Will things change post 'Laal Ishq'? I hope so. My brother watched the film and said 'this is a performance that'll take you where you want to be.' Do you follow Marathi films? Not very regularly, but since I had to work with Swwapnil, I watched all his films except 'Duniyadari'; that one is pending. I have watched 'Fandry', 'Double Seat' and 'Dr Prakash Baba Amte-The Real Hero' too. Is there any particular actor that you like? I feel that the Marathi industry has extremely talented actors. I am a big fan of Mukta Barve and recently had a fan-girl moment when I met her. I had been pestering Swwapnil to get a photo of mine with Mukta. That's off the checklist now. A lot of films suffered in the recent past due to the water-crisis in the state. Did you face a similar situation? Thankfully I haven't faced anything like this personally, but I am very much aware of the situation and sympathize with the farmers and people migrating to Mumbai from various parts of Maharashtra. I have immense respect for Nana Patekar in this regard, due to the work he is doing for the farmers. It has inspired me and I am also doing my bit towards helping those in need.</text>

	<text>Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger said that he was taken back to his younger days as a bodybuilder at the audio launch of Shankar's I. The glitzy audio launch, which also had Superstar Rajinikanth and Kannada actor Puneet Rajkumar as the special guests, had a special segment where bodybuilders who were part of the film, put on a show to a medley of filmi numbers. Arnold was moved by the show and individually congratulated every one of the bodybuilders. He went off script and took to the stage immediately, and said, "It feels like I'm back in my good old bodybuilding days. I thank director Shankar for giving these bodybuilders a job. But what about me? I came all the way from Hollywood looking for a job here. I want to act in your movies. Make a movie here with me, maybe Conan..." The actor also thanked the producer of I, Aascar Ravichandran, with who he said he has been associated for long. "He has been promoting my films in India in a huge way and I thank him for that," he remarked and signed off with his trademark dialogue, 'I'll be back'.</text>

	<text>Being one of the biggest movie stars in the country can often make one an easy target when it comes to controversies. But Mohanlal has always preferred to remain tight-lipped when it comes to them. When he did not put up a social media post on the demise of actor Kalabhavan Mani, it drew flak from some quarters, so did his recent blog post about the JNU issues. The actor seems unruffled by it all, and tells us why silence has always been the best policy for him. Prior to his family tour to South East Asia, we got the actor talking about his upcoming movie 'Pulimurugan', why he doesn't respond to every allegation about him, and his views on the Malayalam film industry. There's a lot of anticipation surrounding your next Malayalam film 'Pulimurugan'. What is its status now? We are almost done with the shooting and it will release in July. And yes, I have actually shot with a tiger for the movie. At first we had considered shooting with a leopard, but then found out that it runs too fast to be filmed. Getting a human to run with it is unrealistic. Tigers are more practical in that sense, as they are heavier. It weighs close to 300 kilos. A lot of graphics are involved but nearly 80 per cent of film was shot with a real tiger. How was the experience shooting with a tiger? I am not able to describe that in words. You have to actually be near a tiger to experience that feeling. But at the end of the day it's an animal. If everything goes well, the film will be the best action movie in our industry. It's got a universal subject and not many films have portrayed the relationship between man and animal. Apart from action, the film also has a lot of emotions involved and is a realistic story that everyone can relate to. I worked 115 days with the team and Peter Hein has choreographed the action scenes. We are trying to get it dubbed in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. Plans are even in place to release a two-hour English version and also dub it in Chinese, Vietnamese and Spanish. Does it open up the possibility of Malayalam films too getting dubbed in other languages? We can't make every Malayalam film like that because of the costs involved. To dub a Malayalam movie into another language, for example Telugu, it has to have elements that would appeal to the audience there. People here watch Tamil and Telugu movies because they get to see a lot of gimmicks that they don't see in Malayalam. A hero in a Tamil film can blink and the next second he is in Switzerland. Industry-wise too Kerala is small. So what we can do is have an exchange of actors and fortunately that is increasingly happening these days. Many of our actors now work in Tamil and Telugu and vice versa. But we can't do it for every film. Your monthly blogs have drawn flak of late... Being an actor doesn't mean that I can't react to what's happening around me. I have been writing my blog for several years. Whenever I have written about pertinent subjects no one has supported them. For instance, the stray dog menace. I cycle in the morning every day and I am still scared of stray dog attacks. My concern is more about children who might not be able to fend off the attack than about myself. It's my right to write on what I feel about certain incidents and it's your choice, whether to read it or not. So is it a conscious decision to not respond to controversies? You feel hurt when you hear things which you are supposed to have said, which you wouldn't even have given a thought to. But if you start responding to such claims, it will only snowball into bigger debates. Most problems occur when you respond to something. But at times, you tend to respond as a reflex action. You should also see if the person you argue with is actually worth it. Now you have social media where it is easy for people to spin so many tales. The amount of time they waste on morphing images just to irritate or tarnish somebody's reputation is unbelievable! Recently I read the book When Breath Becomes Air, which talks about death and one's last moments. Our breath becomes air at a moment's notice and the instant before that is when we think about love, people, friends, God and how much time we have wasted. Time is important and people should use it positively. I believe so. That doesn't mean people can attack me with their words and actions. But you become seasoned and lose interest in responding, over time. A lot of people unnecessarily write things about me, file legal cases against me and make trolls on social media. This happens to all celebrities; I just consider it an occupational hazard. It's been 38 years in the industry and you must have made a lot of friends along the way. How easy has it been to maintain those friendships, given your stardom? Every day has something new to offer in our industry, especially because we keep shuttling between locations. At times you miss your friends and would be able to connect only when you meet. When I began my career, there were no mobile phones and we had limited ways of contacting each other. Now, it has become easier to connect with old friends. Ultimately, it's your decision whether you want to connect with your old friends or not. Some of my friendships are as long as 50 years. But that doesn't mean I have to call everyone I knew back then. A lot of people say that the bond we shared doesn't exist anymore because Mohanlal has become a big star now. I might remember that person but that doesn't mean I have to keep calling him every day, right? You are also part of several social awareness campaigns including one advocating organ donation. How involved are you in such projects? I believe that my purpose for being part of such programmes is served if at least one person benefits from it. I wrote about cleanliness recently in my blog and of late there has been a move to stop using plastic in railway stations and during events and functions. I have been talking about it in several meetings for the last five years. I keep repeating myself every year but it never translated into any action till recently.</text>

While her last film, Love in Manya, opposite Ninasam Sathish, had her portray a glimpse of her glam avataar in the song Currentu Hoda Timealli, her next film, Jai Bajarangabali, opposite Ajai Rao, has her attempting yet another glam avataar. The song, Hrudayada Battery, is sent against a futuristic backdrop and Sindhu, and Ajai are seen in the modern best. Watch the song Hrudayada Battery, from Jai Bajarangabali here.</text>

	<text>Soon after making a mark in the Hindi film industry with Hunterrr, actress Sai Tamhankar is all set to appear in an international project titled 'Love Sonia'. She will be seen sharing screen space with big names like Anupam Kher, Frieda Pinto Adil Hussain, Manoj Bajpayee, Rajkummar Rao and Richa Chadha in the film, which revolves around the issue of sex-trafficking. Speculations about Sai's association with the project arose soon after a photo of her having dinner with some cast and crew members was uploaded online. Confirming the same to us, Sai said, "I feel blessed to be a part of this big project which has superlatively talented actors. I play the role of Anjali in the film. David Womark, who has produced and written the screenplay for the film, loved my performance in Hunterrr and that was taken into consideration while selecting me for this role." The actress is currently shooting for the film in Rajasthan. Interestingly, her Hunterrr co-star Radhika Apte too has become quite a known name on the international circuit and looks like Sai is on the same way now.</text>

	<text>Danseuse, activist, actor, Dr Mallika Sarabhai, performed in the city at a cultural meet on Friday where she incorporated various nuances of dance, drama, music and multi-media to make a statement about women's empowerment. The performance, called 'Sva Kranti', was based on the Gandhian ways that women could adopt to question and ponder their role in society. There were on-stage imagined dialogues with Mahatma Gandhi, where Mallika raised some questions that are vital in any woman's journey, especially when they want to go against the established societal norms. This performance was preceded by a musical performance by city artistes Jaywant Naidu on Hawaiian guitar and Swaroop Mamidipudi on flute.</text>

	<text>Namma star Suriya seems to be going places. A British weekly newspaper had recently announced the list of '50 Sexiest Asian Men' in their paper, and Suriya was the only Tamil actor to have made it to the list. The list also included Bollywood actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor. Suriya has made it to the 50th spot. Suriya is currently working in Masss, a supernatural thriller directed by Venkat Prabhu. Suriya is also co-producing the film, in which he plays the lead opposite Nayanthara and Pranitha.

	<text>Banking upon only a Gujarati release of a film can backfire, according to actor-director Dinesh Lamba, who has directed one Gujarati movie Tuj Mari Jindagi three years ago. After incurring losses after the movie release, Dinesh feels, for his next movie venture, Lions of Gujarat a bilingual movie release will be a safer bet. Says Dinesh Lamba, "The crucial aspect is that how many screens does a films gets. And for a Gujarati film, it becomes very difficult to manage to get satisfactory number of screens." Lions of Gujarat, thus the director says will be released mostly in Hindi across various theatres. "That's the action plan as of now. I have made the film both in Gujarati and Hindi. However Gujarati release I am limiting for only special screenings and occasions. Mostly it will be the Hindi release that will hit the theatres," says Dinesh.</text>

	<text>We had already reported that actress Bhavana is busy preparing for her role in a woman-centric movie, helmed by actor-director Vijay Menon. We have finally got wind of the character she will be playing in the movie titled 'Vilakkumaram'. "Her character Aswathy Ananthakrishnan is a bold and committed school teacher. She knows what her work entails and what it means to be a teacher. She also works as a counsellor in a juvenile home in Kerala," says Vijay Menon. About the movie, the director says, "While it has a serious theme and a strong message about social responsibility, it will be an entertainer." The film is scripted by Vijay's son Nikhil. Talking about his experience working with his dad, the engineering student says that the initial plan was to write a book on the subject. "When I presented the story to my dad, he asked me to make a screenplay out of it. I put in a lot of work and I believe we have a solid script now," Nikhil says. Vijay though tells us that although he liked his son's work, he was not convinced about directing it himself. "I was a bit sceptical initially, thinking that I am just being biased because he is my son. So, I took it to Renji Panicker, who read it at a stretch in two hours and asked me to go ahead," he says. Apart from Bhavana, 'Vilakkumaram' also has actors Manoj K Jayan, Suraj Venjaramoodu and Vinod Kovoor. "A lot of kids will also be part of the film that will go on floors today," says Vijay, adding that film will be shot in Trivandrum and Ladakh.</text>

	<text>CANNES: A fake terror attack panicked guests at the French Riviera hideaway of several Hollywood stars at the Cannes film festival, police said. The publicity stunt, by a French internet company aimed at the super rich, saw a speedboat full of men in helmets and military style uniforms attempt to storm the dock of the five- star Hotel du Cap just around the bay from Cannes. Guests said the men were dressed as an "ISIS-like" militia group, referring to the Islamic State group which killed 130 people in a night of attacks on Paris six months ago. Their inflatable speedboat also flew a black flag similar to the one used by IS. Chillingly, the stunt happened on Friday, the first Friday the 13th since the bloodshed in Paris last November. American publicist J.R. Savet, who was dining on the terrace with Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter when the boat approached, said guests were shocked. "Someone screamed and people jumped out of their chairs and started moving quickly to the swimming pool area. It was pretty scary," he told the Hollywood Reporter. Cannes has been on high terror alert for the 12-day film festival, with a warship moored in the bay and snipers posted on hotel roofs. Oraxy, the Paris-based internet company that organised the stunt, has not yet replied to AFP requests for comment. It describes itself on its website as "the world's first private global marketplace reserved... for Ultra High Net Worth Individuals." A police spokesman told that the men involved in the stunt had earlier tried to breach a sea exclusion zone around Cannes but had been repulsed by the authorities. He said that the men then tried to land at the hotel. Paramilitary gendarmes seized the boat, but the men were not formally arrested. "These men know that they have really overstepped the mark and today they feel ashamed," he added. A justice official told that those behind the stunt were "likely to pay very dearly," and would be prosecuted for breaking maritime rules and for inflicting "psychological trauma". The authorities were also investigating who owns the boat and rented it out, he said. The speedboat had earlier buzzed the yacht of Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg, the "Seven Seas", and another owned by Russian billionaire and Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The Hotel du Cap - also known as Eden Roch - on the ritzy Cap d'Antibes, refused to comment on the incident or say which stars were in the hotel at the time.</text>

	<text>We had earlier reported that director Sathyan Anthikad has roped in Dulquer Salmaan for his upcoming movie. Now we have more information on his character in the film which is yet to be titled. Dulquer will be playing a Thrissurkkaran in the movie, a member of an affluent business family. "My film will talk about the relationship between a father and son. Mukesh plays the role of the father," says the director. "Theirs is an upper-middle class family whose bread and butter is business." The director adds, "Though Mukesh and Mammootty have shared screen space in a number of films, this will be the first time Dulquer and Mukesh are teaming up for a movie." Touted to be a family entertainer, the film is now in the pre-production stage and is expected to go on floors in July. "We are done with the scripting and the location hunt is on. The movie will be shot in Thrissur city." Mammootty's performance as a Thrissurkkaran in Ranjith's 'Pranchiyettan and the Saint' has been considered as one of his best. Will his son Dulquer repeat the same magic? Let's wait and watch!</text>

	<text>"My thatha's death was the biggest blow I've dealt with in all my life," says Rana Daggubati, recalling how he broke down inconsolably when 'Movie Mogul' Dr D Ramanaidu passed away earlier this year. "I have never seen death in my family, especially not of someone who's so close to me...I might be this big guy from the outside, but I'm very sensitive when it comes to my family," says Rana, who admits that he misses his grandfather more than ever as time goes by. "He would have turned 79 today had he been around," says Rana, his voice choking with emotion. "It was only after he passed on that I realised how much my life revolved around him. Whenever I pass by his car, room or office, which all lie empty now, I feel his absence. It's difficult to put it in words, you know... It's almost like there is so much left to say, but you just don't get a second chance..." And yet, Ramanaidu lives on in the collective memories of the Daggubati family, avers Rana. "We tend to talk about him a lot more these days... He is part of almost every conversation we have at home. After all, he was the pillar of the entire family; his demise has left a huge void which cannot be filled." Life was in the little details for Ramanaidu, and the family still strives to keep intact the little traditions he started. "For instance, he always insisted that the entire family eats together, as long as we were in town. So, two of the three meals were a family affair. We still keep that practice intact," Rana says. Life lessons Ramanaidu gave him is the other thing that Rana holds close to his heart. "He taught me the value of discipline and punctuality... he was a living example of that. He was a methodical man and he stuck to the same schedule with clockwork precision all his life. He'd leave home at 9 am, return for lunch at 1 pm, rest for a couple of hours, and step out again at 4 pm. His day would end a little after 8 pm, post dinner. we were all in perfect sync with his timing. And we all imbibed this discipline into our own lives." As it goes often with life and death, what's left behind are a handful of memories, and Rana says it's the fond memories of time spent with his grandfather as a child that he treasures the most. "I remember spending a lot of time with thatha in my native village, Karamchedu. when we first moved to Hyderabad, I remember him taking me on long drives in his new car every time there was a power cut at home. This was in the early 90s, when the Jubilee Hills area was still a sparsely populated, hilly terrain... I'll cherish those memories forever." So, like most grandparents do, did Ramanaidu also wish to see his grandson married? "Oh... not really," Rana says, adding, "He never liked to impose his thoughts on others. Thatha lived his life to the fullest and he wanted us to do the same. Now you know where that side of mine comes from," he quips, with a smile.</text>

	<text>After working out for almost one year, actress Raashi Khanna has finally shed the chubby look and is "six kilos lighter"! What the actress is most surprised to discover was that, yoga and meditation turned out to be more effective in her case, than hitting the gym. "I used to work out twice a day; but to no avail. I kept adding muscle, without losing fat despite following a diet of fish and eggs. It all changed when I went to a spa resort near Haridwar earlier this year. I began to meditate, practice yoga and walk a lot every day. And all that helped me detox." Her exercise regimen is a combination of yoga, dance, walking and two days of functional training at the gym, every week. The trick she lies in figuring out your body type, she says. "I lost six kilos in the past few months, but more than that, I finally figured out what form of exercise works best for my body. It feels great, you know. I've been training in contemporary bollywood dance and working on all the thumkas. I keep pushing the bar and I'm surprised I can pull off some good moves. It's also a good cardio exercise," she says, laughing. Of late, Raashi has been juggling between the sets of Ravi Teja's Bengal Tiger and Ram-starrer Shivam. "Ram is extremely talented and he's full of surprises. Moreover, he has helped me a lot to get my expressions right while acting in a scene. On the other hand, Ravi Teja is a bundle of energy and he's extremely fit. There's always a positive vibe on the sets when he's around," she says signing off.</text>

	<text>Actor Siddharth Shukla, who will be making his filmy debut soon, credits his success to TV shows. I WILL NEVER LEAVE TV Actor Siddharth Shukla is absolutely certain that he will not leave television. After signing a three film deal with producer director Karan Johar, Siddharth is making his Bollywood debut with Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania. While in Lucknow to promote the show Balika Vadhu, in which he plays Shivraj Anoop Shekhar, Anandi's husband, Siddharth says that he will try and work out a balance between TV and films. "Whatever I am today is because of television, so I will never leave TV completely. As it is, films are a new experience for me where as TV is a known medium. A lot of credit for my success today goes to the serial Balika Vadhu," says the tall good looking actor. ALSO READ: Siddharth Shukla gets nostalgic 'Jhalak...' set BALIKA IS NOT AT THE END OF ITS ROAD Defending his show Siddhartha says that viewers are still loving his show. "See, everyone at some point of time feels a little lazy and drained out. Similarly for a TV show too. Kabhi achha lagta hai, kabhi nahi. This see-saw thing goes on everywhere but that doesn't mean you put an end to it. In fact later, you will work doubly hard to make up for that complacency. Same is the case with our show. We are constantly coming up with new tracks to keep the viewers attracted to the show. And it's simple, had the show not been doing well, the channel wouldn't have kept giving us extensions. It's been running strong for the past six years. There's a lot more left to do in Balika...," says he. TV IS NOT A FEMALE DOMINATED MEDIUM Siddharth doesn't feel that content on TV is women oriented. "Nothing can work without a balance. I agree Balika... initially focused mainly on Anandi, but over the years, even the men are getting their due. In fact I feel that goes for all shows on TV. There are no leads in a serial. Mainly because a story can't function with just one person. At some point or the other, every character gets prominence over the others and they become the lead in the show at that time. For instance in Balika..., the focus is on my character Shiv these days, so in that sense I am the lead," says Siddharth with a smile. READ: No girl would want to be in relationship with me says Siddharth Shukla NO TIME FOR LOVE Touted as one of the most eligible bachelors of the small screen, Siddharth takes the compliment with a question , "Really? Where are the girls?, adding, "I like the company of women but given my present situation I am sure no girl would like to date me. I have such a busy schedule from 5 am to 11 pm, that I can't devote time to anyone however much I may like to. For the time being I have to remain single," says he with a shrug.

	<text>Rani Chatterjee recently wrapped up the shoot of her upcoming film Ichchhadhari. The interesting bit is that she is romanced animals in the film. But these days, she is fed up with the numerous rumors going on about her in the media. There were reports that she is romancing her Ichchadhari co-star Yash Mishra and that she has locked lips with him in the film. Reacting to these news, she said, "I have neither done a liplock scene ever nor do I have any such intentions in the future. I am like a common Indian girl. Why would I create problems in the life of a married man (Mishra)? All such news is rubbish. I only share a professional relationship with Yash." She added, "I don't know who is spreading such silly rumors. Personally, I am too disturbed by all this." Currently, Rani is shooting Hum Hai Jodi No. 1 with Ravi Kishan in Lucknow despite facing health issues. After this one, she will be shooting Rani Ki Aayegi Baarat where she would be playing the character of an extremely shy girl. (Source: Bhojpurimedia.com)</text>

	<text>Real-life characters are increasingly serving as fodder for Malayalam movies of late. After Nivin Pauly's 'Jacobinte Swargarajyam', Kunchacko Boban's upcoming movie Kochuouvva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho has also borrowed elements from the life of a real person. In tune with its title, the film revolves around two characters  Kochuouvva played by Kunchacko Boban and Ayyappa Das portrayed by actor Sudheesh's son Master Rudraksh. The former plays a character who tries to fix others' problems. "My character Kochuouvva is based on a real person," says Kunchacko Boban. "If we actually mirror his real-life actions and generosity on screen, the audience would find it too cinematic. The irony is that we actually had to tone down his actions a bit for the film." While the actor doesn't reveal who the character is based on, he says that the movie has a fresh theme that would appeal to everyone. "The central characters in the movie have different aims in life but a particular incident unites their path towards these goals. Paulo Coelho's writings are what bring them together," explains the 'School Bus' actor. Incidentally, the film will once again have Kunchacko playing a rustic youth similar to the character in his latest release directed by Rishi Sivakumar. "While it has a serious theme at the core, director Sidhartha Siva has ensured that the film is made in a very entertaining way. It will be a refreshing movie, replete with songs and a lot of humour." 'Kochuouvva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho', which also has Aju Varghese and Suraj Venjaramoodu, has already finished two schedules and is currently waiting for the monsoons to hit to resume the shooting. However, the team is yet to zero in on the lead actress for the movie.</text>

The actress, who has always stood apart from the rest , off and on screen, says that it is her mother who has influenced her the most in life, be it in her life or career. "My mother has influenced me the most in my life. She was the one who taught me to have courage and strength, to be a confident individual and not get carried away by all that glitters," she says. ""She taught me to always stand on my own two feet and to be independent." Her mother is also the reason she is an actress today, Aparna adds. "She gifted me with the greatest present in my life by introducing me to the stage. I am who I am today, as a person and as a professional, because of my mom." However, despite all this, her mother still treats her like a baby, she admits. "She spoils me silly and gives in to all of my whims and fancies.

	<text>Govind Padmasoorya might have relinquished his dance show host duties but that's not stopping him from shaking a leg. The actor is all set to showcase his moves as a Zumba instructor in the upcoming Ranjith Sankar directorial, 'Pretham'. "I play Shibu Majeed, who is a globetrotter," says Padmasoorya. "He is an engineering graduate, who was forced to do an MBA in the US by his parents. Once there, he found that the business degree was not his cup of tea, so he dropped out and opted for philosophy, which he again gave up. Meanwhile, he enrolled for Zumba classes in his free time and realised that was his true calling. So, he trains to become a Zumba instructor, much to the ire of his family." Did his dance skills have anything to do with him landing the role? "There isn't too much dance involved but it would help me to get into the shoes of the character. Also, he is a happy-go-lucky, flirtatious guy, which I could relate to, I guess." The horror-comedy, which will go on floors within a fortnight, also has Jayasurya, Aju Varghese and Joju George. "The movie is different from Ranjith's previous films like 'Punyalan Agarbatties' and 'Su.. Su.. Sudhi Vathmeekam', which were motivational movies. While 'Pretham' is an entertainer, it will be experimental in terms of the filmmaking style and its theme will delve into something that's not often discussed," explains Padmasoorya.</text>

	<text>SikhNet To Launch Free Online Animated Story for International Women's Day - in celebration of International Women's Day, SikhNet will launch an original short animated film, titled KAUR, free online. #makeithappen. #kaurpower. kaur.sikhnet.com. KAUR tells the story of a young Sikh girl, Saibhang Kaur, who loves science but feels the social pressure that "girls don't belong in science club." Not sure what to do about her dreams, Saibhang Kaur thinks about giving up. But when Saibhang's grandmother tells her the true story of the 18th century Sikh warrior princess Mai Bhago, Saibhang discovers her courage. The idea for KAUR began four years ago when SikhNet webmaster, Gurumustuk Singh Khalsa, wrote a blog article bemoaning how his daughter loved to imitate Disney princesses. He posed the question - wouldn't it be great for there to be an animated story about true-life, powerful 'princess' figures that his daughter could imitate, instead? Upon reading the blog post, an anonymous donor made a sizeable contribution to SikhNet, creating seed money for the project. SikhNet has produced over 100 original audio stories for kids. However, they had never produced an original animation before, so it took time for the company to decide what to do with the money. Four years later - the result is KAUR. KAUR focuses on two stories simultaneously. The story of a young girl who has to deal with the modern version of "women belong in the kitchen," and the story of Mai Bhago, an amazing Sikh woman warrior who led 40 men into battle against an army over 10,000 strong. This small band of Sikhs defended the principles of freedom and equality against a medieval version of ISIS. In KAUR, the story of Mai Bhago helps Saibhang Kaur find the strength to face the battles in her own life. SikhNet has chosen to launch the animation in celebration of International Women's Day. The struggles of Saibhang Kaur represent the struggles of so many young women around the world seeking to find a place for themselves beyond traditional roles. Mai Bhago is a true-life heroine, whose story can inspire all girls, everywhere. The animation will be available FREE online beginning on March 3rd at: kaur.sikhnet.com. It has a running time of approximately 20 minutes.

	<text>Rumours were rife that Ajith was to play a taxi driver in his next film directed by Siruthai Siva. However, we now hear that it is the leading lady of the film Shruti Haasan, who plays the role of a taxi driver and not Ajith. The actress has recently joined the set and now, the team has wrapped up the first schedule. A source from the unit says, "Shruti Haasan is kicked about her role. She plays a taxi driver, who drives in Kolkata. She is donning a khaki uniform too. She has recently shot in Chennai and the crew may travel to Kolkata for the next schedule of the film. So, it is Shruti who's playing the driver, not Ajith." Sources also say that a huge set that resembles certain places in Kolkata has been erected in Chennai. Apart from that, the team may head to Kolkata to shoot some of the scenes. During the month-long schedule, which concluded recently, Siva canned portions of Ajith and Lakshmi Menon. Shruti shot for just couple of days during this schedule and she will shoot for major portions of the film in the next schedule only.</text>

	<text>BERLIN: German police said on Saturday they found a pig's head bearing an "insulting inscription" outside Chancellor Angela Merkel's constituency office in the country's northeast. A police patrol discovered the animal's head outside the office in the Baltic sea town of Stralsund in the early hours of Saturday. A spokesman for regional police refused to be drawn on the nature of the insults, saying only that they were directed at Merkel, who was first elected to parliament in Stralsund 26 years ago. The conservative chancellor has been criticised by many Germans over her welcoming stance towards the migrants that have poured into Europe over the past year. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been buoyed by concerns over the integration of the more than one million asylum-seekers that arrived in Germany in 2015, becoming the country's third-biggest party. Merkel's migrant policies have also been contested by some members of her own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as well as its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).</text>

	<text>MEXICO CITY: Mexico released a statement on Thursday stating that it was not satisfied with the Egyptian government's response to an aerial bombing in Egypt last year in which eight Mexican tourists were killed. The Foreign Ministry published the statement on its website in which it said that it had sent a letter to the Egyptian embassy to express its "surprise and dissatisfaction" with the government's failure to thoroughly investigate the case, penalize the perpetrators and compensate victims. In addition to the eight Mexicans, four Egyptians were also killed while six other Mexicans were wounded. Last September, an Egyptian army aircraft fired on a group parked for a barbecue near a tourist site, presuming them to be militants. The ministry said that although media outlets had reported on negotiations with one of the victim's families, Mexico did not have any knowledge of the case. The New York Times reported earlier this week that the Egyptian tourism federation would compensate families of three Mexican victims and it was also negotiating with families of the other Mexican victims.</text>

	<text>DHAKA: At least 42 people, including women and children, were killed in Bangladesh within the last 24 hours after being struck by lightning during thundershowers, officials said on Friday. Meteorological office said the downpour brought with it thundershowers in 14 districts, including Dhaka. Nine people were killed in five districts on Friday as rain has been lashing several parts of the country after a spell of heat waves. Thirty-three people, including children and women, were killed on Thursday in 12 different districts. The lightning that accompanied the seasonal nor'wester storms claimed the highest eight lives in northwestern Pabna, five each in neighbouring Sirajganj and Rajshahi districts. Police said Dhaka, Chittagong, Joypurhat and Naogaon saw two deaths each while one person died after being struck by bolt in Sunamganj on Friday. In Dhaka, sudden thunderbolts killed two engineering students when they were playing football in the rain. Four persons died in Kishoreganj and Brahmanbarhia each, reports said. Eleven more deaths were reported from other parts of the country. The casualties included a number of children who were playing in open grounds during the rain but mostly the victims were farmers, including women, who were in their fields. Rains appeared as a welcome shower after a heat wave scorched the country, but the downpour brought with it the lightning that caused the unusually high number of casualties. "Bangladesh witnesses the seasonal nor'wester storm every year from March to May when the thunderbolts also occur," meteorologist Hafizur Rahman said adding that the phenomenon appears mostly in northwestern Rajsahi and Sylhet regions. Fellow meteorologist Sujit Kumar Deb Sharma said lightning kills up to 300 people on an average each year in Bangladesh though not all the incidents were not reported in the media. The Met office has predicted rain or thundershowers with gusty or squally wind today in Dhaka, and in northwestern and northeastern regions. Some areas in southwestern and northwestern parts of the country may also receive rain and thundershowers.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: China is deploying more troops on the border with India while modernizing its nuclear force and improving its strike capabilities, the Pentagon has said, even as the Obama administration challenged Beijing's assertion that New Delhi does not meet the criteria to be a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The state department, referring to Obama's statement in 2015, said India "meets missile technology control regime requirements and is ready for NSG membership". The shadow play between Washington, Beijing, and New Delhi was very much in evidence on Friday as the US defence establishment highlighted China's growing military strength in the region, ostensibly with an eye on courting India as a strategic counterweight. "We have noticed an increase in capability and force posture by the Chinese military in areas close to the border with India ," US deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia Abraham Denmark said during a news conference after Pentagon submitted its annual 2016 report to the US Congress on 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'. "It's difficult to say how much of this is driven by internal considerations to maintain internal stability, and how much of it is an external consideration." But as far as Washington is concerned, he added, it would continue to enhance bilateral engagement with India "not in the China context but because India is an increasingly important player" by itself. "We are going to engage India because of its value," Denmark said. Beijing increasing military presence A series of reports and remarks from Washington amid continuing tensions with China is coming just ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit alongside India's own issues with Beijing, notably its use of Pakistan to needle India on issues such as terrorism and access to advanced nuclear technology. But in a report to the US Congress, the Pentagon warned of China's increasing military presence including bases in various parts of the world, in particular Pakistan  with which it has a "longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests". China's expanding international economic interests are increasing demands for the PLA Navy (PLAN) to operate in more distant seas to protect Chinese citizens, investments, and critical sea lines of communication, it said, adding, "China most likely will seek to establish additional naval logistics hubs in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and a precedent for hosting foreign militaries." READ ALSO: Indian, Chinese armies resolve to maintain peace in border meet The US navy itself is now working even more closely with the Indian Navy , outlining the emerging contours of efforts to dominate the sea lanes in the Indian Ocean through which some 60% of the world's energy trade passes. Meanwhile, Washington also endorsed India's claim for a membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group that the China-Pakistan axis has been thwarting . "I'd point you back to what the President said during his visit to India in 2015, where he reaffirmed that the US view was that India meets missile technology control regime requirements and is ready for NSG membership," State Department spokesman John Kirby said when asked about reports about Beijing and Islamabad joining hands to stall India's NSG membership. China has claimed that many members of the 48-nation NSG share its view that signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is an "important" standard for the group's expansion, an assertion that Washington does not agree with. The western world's support for India's membership is based in part on its sterling non-proliferation record, which Pakistan, as a rogue proliferator, and China as an illegal enabler, cannot match. All these issues are being thrashed out in private ahead of PM Modi's visit to Washington on June 7-8 in what promises to be one of the most consequential visits by an Indian leader to the US.</text>

"He took out the racks and made himself a nice cubby hole," said chief deputy Glenn Blank of the Jasper county sheriff's office in East Texas. The inmate, Wesley Evans, 20, was captured on Wednesday morning and was taken back into custody after an escape that lasted about 24 hours. He is expected to face charges for the escape attempt. Evans has been in jail since March 8 on charges of aggravated robbery, auto theft and arson. He was taken to the hospital for treatment of a swollen hand.</text>

	<text>DHAKA: A 75-year-old Buddhist monk was found hacked to death Saturday in Bangladesh's remote southeastern district of Bandarban, police said, the latest in a spate of murders of religious minorities and secular activists. The body of Maung Shue U. Chak was found Saturday morning by his daughter-in-law when she went to give him some food, local police official Abul Khayer said. His throat had been slit overnight. While no one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing, it follows a slew of murders in recent years of members of religious minority groups, foreigners, atheist bloggers and secular publishers in Bangladesh by suspected Islamist radicals. The killings have come amid growing concern that religious extremism is gaining ground in the Muslim-majority nation of 160 million. The Islamic State group and an al-Qaida-linked group have claimed responsibility for some of the recent killings. But the authorities in Bangladesh insist that neither of the groups has a presence in the country. Instead, the authorities have blamed political opposition and local militant groups for the violence. Last month, suspected Islamist militants killed two prominent gay rights activists, an atheist student and a university professor. Read this story in Marathi</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The US is committed to maintaining its "important" and "vital" relationship with Pakistan, the Obama Administration said amid reports of strains in bilateral ties. "It is an important, vital relationship that we strongly believe in. Is it complicated at times? Absolutely it is. And do we see eye-to-eye on every issue with Pakistan? No, we don't," state department spokesman, John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference. "But that's why the relationship matters so much because we have shared threats and shared concerns, shared interests in the region. And we're going to continue to work at it," he said. Kirby was responding to a question on the statement made by Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz that his country's relationship with the United States has been under stress for the past three months. Kirby said he has not seen the statement. "I didn't see his comments. So I'm going to refrain from responding specifically to that sentiment," he said. Kirby did not agree when asked if the US-Pakistan ties are not at the best of times these days. "It is an important relationship that we continue to work at very, very seriously. We're going to remain committed to. And I would not share that characterization of it," Kirby said.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Police are looking for three teens in the US who skipped school to live-stream themselves engaging in sex acts on Facebook to their classmates, a media report said. On January 14, 2016, four juvenile students viewed a livestream on the social media website using their cell phones during health class at 1 p.m. The students said the videos show a 14-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy engaging in sex acts, the report added. Police in Milwaukee city of the US are asking Facebook to hand over all the information it has on the account of a 14-year-old girl. From pictures, status history and videos to user information like name, email, and IP address, a report on CBS58.com said. Meanwhile, Milwaukee Public Schools released a statement saying in January, staff became aware of a video depicting inappropriate conduct that took place outside of school and off campus. "The school immediately notified proper authorities and cooperated with the investigation. We took appropriate disciplinary action against those involved, which would be in addition to any outside consequences they may face," the statement said. A Milwaukee County search warrant notes that the two juvenile girls in the video could be charged with "exposing a child to harmful material" while the 15-year-old boy that participated in the sexual acts was not listed as a suspect on the warrant. The video was viewed by students at Barack Obama School but was not filmed there. The two girls in the videos attend the school but according to the school principal, the two suspects skipped school after the first period, the report said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: India and the US have formed a Brain Trust aimed at deepening and strengthening cooperation between the best and brightest in the scientific community of the world's two largest democracies. The partnership between the Indian and American scientific community, researchers, academicians, businesses and entrepreneurs is a "win-win" for not only the two countries, but also the entire world, said Indian ambassador to the US Arun K Singh. "We find now a strategic convergence in our interest and we are working together in different areas," he said in his address at the inaugural dinner of the Indo-US Brain Trust here on Thursday. A partnership for research and development and scientific collaboration is essential to take this relationship to the next level, he said. "There is a huge potential there," he added. "Several major US companies have developed products in India, which their CEOs have said to me they could not have developed in the US because researchers and scientists here approach the problem from different perspective with different resource availability, they are targeting with different objective," Singh said. "Whereas in India the aim very often is to minimize the use of resources, keep the cost down, maximize the number of people that can be reached through the product and thereby you end up with something that is different and has relevance in a different context," he said. Applauding India's success, former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said India has now emerged as a model for other developing countries. "The idea is to create a platform- which partners scientific minds from both countries to explore and create timely solutions to pressing global challenges," said Ron Somers founder and CEO of India First Group welcoming the guests at the inaugural dinner. "The Indo-US Brain Trust must strive to create a shared platform for the US and Indian scientific communities to exchange, synergize, and deepen collaboration," he added. Dr Krishna K Banaudha, an Indian-American scientist and the brain behind the project, said Indo-US Brain Trust intends to assemble some of the finest minds and friends who, by their very actions and livelihoods, support a deepening of US-India collaboration in science, research, academia, entrepreneurship and innovation. "This group collectively represents the extraordinary partnership underway between the United States and India which is shaping a very bright future," he said.</text>

	<text>ILALO, ECUADOR: An Ecuadoran who lost both his feet is aiming to become the first climber to scale the world's toughest mountain, K2, with artificial limbs and without oxygen supplies. Santiago Quintero had half of each foot amputated for frostbite after climbing Aconcagua in Argentina in 2002. But that has not stopped him. "They told me I would never climb 5,000-meter mountains again," the smiling 41-year-old told AFP. "But no one can tell me how I am and what I am. Being what I want to be is my decision." Quintero scaled Mount Everest, the world's highest peak at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet), in 2013. The expedition landed him in the hospital in intensive care. Now he is aiming to conquer K2 -- the second-highest mountain at 8,611 meters, but considered technically the hardest to climb. He ascended K2, which is on the border between China and Pakistan, once before but stopped short of the summit. His party had to turn back when they sank up to their chests in snow. He says he caught frostbite on Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas, because he could not afford a $100 pair of waterproof covers for his boots. He spent nine months in the hospital in Spain, where doctors performed the amputations, then a further five years waiting to have prosthetic feet fitted. With those artificial members, he has already scaled seven of the 14 mountains in the world that are over 8,000 meters high. In total 188 mountaineers have scaled K2. "They did it with their bodies fully intact," said Quintero. "That's quite different." He plans to start his hike up K2 on June 13 and finish on July 31. "I am quite determined," he told AFP, while resting during a training climb on the extinct Ilalo volcano in northern Ecuador. "Without the mountains, I think I would rather be dead."</text>

	<text>He has shot to fame as London's first 'Muslim' mayor. And the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, a Hindu shrine, is among Saqid Khans's favourite places in the city. In a recent Facebook post, Khan has expressed his fondness for the temple. Pictures of Khan visiting the temple days before being elected as the mayor have gone viral where Khan is seen interacting with people from other faiths at the temple. He even holds out his hand for a priest to tie a string around his wrist, in keeping with a Hindu custom. Khan has declared his intentions to stand up for the London's Indian community and further strengthen the city's friendship with India. He called himself the 'most pro-business' London mayor ever, and expressed interest in leading a trade delegation to India. He also vowed to challenge the present government's 'unfair visa restrictions' that often make it difficult for businesses to find the best skilled employees.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: As many as 53 people were killed and 16 others listed missing in natural disasters across China last month which affected more than 5.6 million people and caused direct economic losses of about $550 million. The disasters included drought, earthquakes, floods, forest fires, gales and hail, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday, citing a Ministry of Civil Affairs statement released on Friday. They caused about 3.6 billion yuan (about $550 million) in direct economic losses, it said. More than 53,000 people had to be relocated, 28,000 of whom needed emergency assistance, while about 6,000 houses collapsed, mostly in southern regions hit by floods, the report said. Overall damage was generally less than in the same period last year, during which 68 people were killed.</text>

	<text>RANCHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday produced the CRPF deputy commandant Vinita Kumari in the court of a special CBI judge which forwarded her to jail on 14 days judicial custody. The CBI has registered a case against Kumari, deputy commandant with CRPF (133 Bn) Ranchi, who was arrested on Thursday, and unknown others for alleged illegal involvement in the recruitment process in CRPF. Meanwhile, her husband Dr Arvind Kumar Singh, also accused of helping her wife in irregularities in recruitment, was called for interrogation and was arrested on Friday. A press release from the CBI office said: "It was alleged in the complaint that the officer had approached medical officers of the recruitment board to declare medically unfit candidates as fit in lieu of illegal gratification. It was further alleged that the officer has also requested the medical officers of the medical board to intimate bank particulars by opening a new bank account, so that the alleged bribe can be deposited in the new bank accounts."</text>

	<text>RANCHI: With over 9000 supporters, JMM's Rajmahal MP Vijay Hansda and nine MLAs (all from different locations in Jharkhand) were detained on Saturday when they were trying to enforce a day-long bandh to mark a protest against the recently implemented local resident policy in the state. The state government implemented local resident policy in April which says anyone living in Jharkhand (besides some other provisions) since 1985 is a local. The JMM-led protesters claim the policy is tilted towards non-Tribals and want the cut-off date to be 1932. Two vehicles were torched in Jamshedpur and Bokaro (one in each). Suspected bandh supporters torched a truck and a bus in Jamshedpur. A passenger auto was vandalized in Ranchi's Ratu road and a truck attacked in Latehar. Some more minor sporadic incidents of violence marked the bandh which, police spokesperson S N Pradhan, claimed was largely peaceful. Attempts were made to disrupt railway services in Bokaro and highways at several places in Jharkhand. Pradhan said the MP and MLAs with the supporters were detained from different parts of the state during protests and kept at temporary camps. Nala MLA Ravindra Nath Mahto, Maheshpur MLA Stephen Marandi, Shashi Bhushan Samad MLA of Chakradharpur, Anil Murmu MLA of Littipara, Jagannath Mahto MLA of Dumri, MLA from Mandu Jai Prakash Bhai Patel, Dashrath Gorai MLA of Saraikela, Devendra Mahto MLA of Gomia and Arup Chatterjee MLA of Nirsa were arrested. The bandh was backed by Congress, RJD, JVM-P, Adivasi Moolvasi Janadhikar Manch, Kendriya Sarna Samiti, and Left parties. "The police crackdown was unprecedented and contrary to the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution. Even the peaceful protestors were not spared," JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said. DGP D K Pandey inspected security arrangements in the morning and instructed officers monitoring the deployed personnel. A team from mounted battalion was brought to Ranchi from Hazaribag. The seven horses marching through the city's roads created a sense of fear in the bandh supporters. JMM leader Antu Tirkey said: "As soon as we came out on the street to protest the police detained us. We were not allowed to democratically protest." Majority of 700 persons were detained and confined inside Birsa Munda Football Stadium. Left party leaders, craning their head out of the windows of the bus in which they were ferried shouted that the local resident policy was a betrayal of the tribals faith. The bandh forced closure of marketplaces closed and vehicles were off the highways, said Ranchi SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi. Educational institutions and business centers were closed in Ranchi, Jamshepdur, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Hazaribag, Dumka and other centers. The transport service in towns was absent and buses playing between different districts were stranded at bus depots.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Love at first whiff is the idea behind "Smell Dating", a New York matchmaking service that promises to help single people sniff out their perfect match by breathing in the odors from dirty T-shirts. Artist Tega Brain, who teaches at New York's School for Poetic Computation, and Sam Lavigne, an editor and researcher at New York University, created Smell Dating, which they describe as an art project. Each of its first 100 clients received a T-shirt to wear for three days straight without bathing. The clients then mailed the T-shirts back to Brain and Lavigne's "Sweat Shop" at NYU, where they were cut into swatches. Smell Dating then sent batches of 10 mixed swatches back to the clients to sniff this week. A match will be made if one client likes the scent of another and the olfactory attraction is mutual. In other words, if "Client 55" likes "Client 69" and vice versa, put a heart around it, Brain said. The idea is based on the science of pheromones, the chemical signals that creatures from gerbils to giraffes send out to entice mates. Clients, who pay a one-time fee of $25, dive in nose-first, unaware of a potential smell-mate's age, gender or sexual orientation. "Most normal dating services, you rely on profile pictures, assumptions that come from visual information," Brain said. "You either really like the smell of someone or you don't. It's much more innate." On Wednesday, 25-year-old NYU graduate student Jesse Donaldson excitedly opened the package of white swatches in individually numbered plastic bags that had arrived at his apartment in Brooklyn. He said he hoped Smell Dating could help where other popular matchmaking services had failed. "I'm like so many other people in New York City, using Tinder, using OK Cupid," Donaldson said, "and my main issue with these things is you feel like you're shopping for somebody as opposed to making a genuine connection with another human being." Brain said she and Lavigne consulted "a lot of smell researchers" about their art project, which explores whether a person's body odor can trigger Cupid's arrow. "We wanted to see if people would be interested in meeting other people just based on this one bit of information rather than this avalanche of information that you usually get," said Lavigne as he watched volunteers wearing hooded white jumpsuits and blue rubber gloves cut up the worn T-shirts at the Sweat Shop. "Whoa! This one is ready to go!" said a worker, wincing as he sniffed a swatch before putting it into a plastic bag marked #34. In Brooklyn, Donaldson tore into the first plastic bag, removed the swatch and sniffed. "Fresh-done laundry," he said. He opened another and inhaled. "Oh. That is nutty. I'm just going to seal that back up." Then he brought yet another swatch to his nostrils, nodded and said, "Oh." He savored a second whiff and added, "That's my match."</text>

	<Heading>Woman cannot name daughter 'Cyanide': UK court</Heading>

	<text>LONDON: A mother cannot name her daughter 'Cyanide', a British court has ruled in a landmark case, saying her unusual choice might harm her children. The woman, who also chose the name Preacher for the girl's twin brother, insisted that she had a right to name her own children. But the mother, from Powys, Wales, was thwarted by top judges on Thursday. In the first case of its kind, appeal court judges ruled that it was an "extreme" case and that the mother's "unusual" choices might harm her children. The mother has a chaotic history of mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse and relationships with abusive men, said Lady Justice King. The twins, who are infants, and two of their half-siblings are now living with foster parents, Wales Online reported. When Powys county council social workers learnt of the names the mother had chosen for the twins, they took the case to court in an unprecedented step. In June last year, a judge issued an injunction against the mother, forbidding her from formally registering the twins' unorthodox forenames. Her lawyers appealed, insisting that the refusal to let her name her own children violated her right to respect for family life. Lady Justice King, sitting with Lady Justice Gloster and Lord Justice David Richards, said that naming a little girl after a "notorious poison" was simply unacceptable. Although there was nothing seriously objectionable about the name Preacher, she ruled that both twins' names should be chosen by their older half-siblings. While ruling in the landmark case, the judge said that "even allowing for changes in taste, fashion and developing individual perception," Cyanide was a very odd name to give to a baby girl. The mother said Preacher was a "rather cool name" which sent a "strong spiritual" message and which would "stand my son well for the future". Cyanide, she said, was a "lovely, pretty name" and had positive connotations as the poison which ended the lives of both Hitler and his aide Paul Goebbels. Justice King said the courts would intervene to prevent a parent naming a child "in only the most extreme cases". But she ruled, "This is one of those rare cases where the court should intervene to protect the girl twin from emotional harm that I am satisfied she would suffer if called Cyanide."</text>

	<text>Critics of Portugal's culture minister are calling on him to be fired for doing something, well, uncultured. After being called "incompetent" and promoting a "work style of chronyism, domineering and rudeness", culture minister Joao Soares reckoned it was time to slap two columnists at an influential newspaper. "I see that I do have to find him (columnist Augusto Seabra), and now also Vasco Pulido Valente, to give them some sound slapping. It will be good for them. And for me," Soares wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. Sergio Azevedo, deputy bench leader for the main opposition Social Democrats, said Soares' remarks were incompatible with the government job. "There's only one way for him. Out," he wrote on the same social network. The original post garnered over 800 mostly critical comments with many calling for his resignation. The ministry would not comment and Soares, son of former prime minister and president Mario Soares, was not reachable.</text>

	<text>A woman pretended to be a man and used a rubber penis to trick teenage girls into having sex with her. Jennifer Staines was sentenced to 39 months in prison after admitting she set up social media profiles using the name Jason in order to contact the girls, who were aged between 12 and 17 at the time of the offences. In one case, the relationship lasted more than a year. Bristol crown court heard police found a rubber penis and incriminating DNA at Staines' home, and that the 23-year-old would use condoms when sleeping with the girls. She pleaded guilty to sexual assault and two counts of possessing indecent photos of one victim. She also admitted two sexual assaults on a second victim and three sexual assaults on a third. According to Bristol Post, judge Barry Cotter QC told her: "You planned carefully to deceive. You did everything to ensure you had the ability to engage in relationships in which they believed you were a gender you were not. I can't determine whether it was for love, love and sex, or just sex." Investigating officer detective constable Nadine Partridge said: "Jennifer Staines deceived and manipulated her victims into believing she was a young man which is an appalling breach of trust. Her actions were driven by her own selfish desires and although her victims "consented" to sexual activity with her, they were deceived about the true nature of what they were engaging in. The manipulation was so extreme that one of her victims still struggles to believe she was actually in a relationship with a woman, not a man." "The victims and their families have been through a traumatic ordeal and they've found the courage to support the police investigation from the outset. I hope this outcome will help them move on with their lives. I believe there may be more victims out there so I'd encourage anyone who feels they may have been contacted by Jennifer Staines, posing as Jason, to come forward and speak to us. We're here to listen, believe and support you," Partridge added. Last year, a woman was jailed for eight years after pretending to be a man in order to trick her female friend into having sex with her. Gayle Newland put on a deep voice and used a prosthetic penis and a blindfold over almost a dozen sexual encounters during their two-year relationship.</text>

	<text>A Texas county jail inmate who escaped custody while receiving treatment in a hospital was found in the dishwasher of his girlfriend's apartment in boxer shorts and wearing handcuffs with the chain severed, a sheriff's department said on Thursday. "He took out the racks and made himself a nice cubby hole," said chief deputy Glenn Blank of the Jasper county sheriff's office in East Texas. The inmate, Wesley Evans, 20, was captured on Wednesday morning and was taken back into custody after an escape that lasted about 24 hours. He is expected to face charges for the escape attempt. Evans has been in jail since March 8 on charges of aggravated robbery, auto theft and arson. He was taken to the hospital for treatment of a swollen hand.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump appears to have a passionate supporter in Joseph Hornick, a New Jersey man who faces a $2,000 fine or 90 days in jail for flying a flag emblazoned with the billionaire candidate's name over his home. Local officials said the flag violates an ordinance prohibiting the display of political signs more than 30 days ahead of an election and issued him a summons. New Jersey's primary is on June 7. For weeks, Hornick has displayed the blue flag with Trump's "Make America Great Again!" campaign slogan on a pole outside his two-story West Long Branch house, at a busy intersection near Monmouth University, in a show of his support for Trump. Trump has been campaigning this week in neighboring New York in an effort to snag the Republican presidential nomination. Despite being issued a summons on March 25 for the violation, Hornick apparently intends to keep it up. "The fine can be in the Millions of dollars! That flag will never come down!" he wrote in a defiant Facebook post. Hornick did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lori Cole, West Long Branch's clerk, said on Friday that Hornick, 54, could also face 90 days in jail as a maximum penalty if a judge determines he is in violation of the law. "It just came up recently," she said of the controversy. Brian Hegarty, a former Democratic Party councilman, complained to authorities about Hornick's flag, according to a March 25 police report. Hegarty told police that he had complained several times about the flag to a code enforcement official, but no action was taken. Sergeant James Gomez in the report said Hornick initially agreed to take down the flag before speaking with his attorney. "He advised on the advice of an attorney he would not be removing the flag and would fight any summons issued to him," Gomez wrote. Hornick is scheduled to appear in court on April 20.</text>

	<text>CLEVELAND: The Ohio childhood home of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, available for rent in time for the Republican National Convention this summer, could have been had for $8,000 a month until Friday afternoon, when the price went up and references to the infamous criminal came down. The home where Dahmer grew up and in 1978 committed his first murder is in Bath, Ohio, 26 miles south of Cleveland, where the convention is scheduled to be held in July. The listing on a real-estate company website initially included a reference to Dahmer but on Friday that was removed and the price had been increased to $10,000 a month. Dahmer was convicted in 1992 in the murder and dismemberment of 17 boys and men, some of whom he ate, over a period of 14 years. He was beaten to death in 1994 by another prison inmate while serving 15 life terms in Wisconsin, where most of the murders took place after he moved there. The listing by Howard Hanna, the official real estate broker for the convention, had been up since February and initially included the fact that the three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 2,170-square-foot home was once occupied by Dahmer. It had described the house as a "mid-century modern home with a true park-like setting. Smoking and animals okay. This is Jeffrey Dahmer's childhood home. Close to Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Montrose shopping. Easy access to I-77 highway." By Friday afternoon, the Dahmer sentence had been removed. Julia Domenick, the listing agent at Hanna, could not be reached for comment. In 1978, at age 18, Dahmer killed a teenaged hitchhiker, then dismembered and buried the body in a shallow grave behind the Bath house. Homeowner Chris Butler, a member of the Akron-based punk band The Waitresses, bought the house in 2005 for $295,000 after its history was disclosed. He could not be reached for comment.</text>

	<text>A high-tech marine drone scouring the depths of Scotland's Loch Ness for one of nature's most elusive beasts has found a "monster"  but not the one it was looking for. Rather than the fabled Loch Ness Monster itself, the probe has discovered a 30-foot (9 metre) replica used in the 1970 film "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes", which sank nearly 50 years ago after its buoyant humps were removed. Undeterred, the enthusiastic monster-hunters steering the drone are continuing their two-week search for any evidence that might prove the existence of "Nessie". The survey by Norwegian company Kongsberg Maritime has been the most detailed to date of the Loch's icy depths. The Munin drone is capable of mapping vast areas down to 1,500 feet and is often used to locate downed aircraft. "The vehicle allows sonars to scan just a few metres from the loch floor, giving resolution several orders of magnitude greater than anything before," said Kongsberg Maritime engineer Craig Wallace. Along with the movie replica, it has also found a 27-foot shipwreck as it maps the Loch floor. Far from being disappointed by the findings, Steve Feltham who has been hunting Nessie for 25 years, says the maps will help him in his quest. "I think the findings are fantastic," he said. "We now have a more detailed map of the rock bottom than ever before, which will show us the location of every lump and bump. "We can send back cameras to look at anything of interest which could turn out to be the carcass of the animal," he added. "It's shown there's a hell of a lot more to investigate." The first written record of a monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is said to have banished a "water beast" to the depths of the River Ness in the 6th century. The most famous picture of Nessie, known as the "surgeon's photo", was taken in 1934 and showed a head on a long neck emerging from the water. It was revealed 60 years later to have been a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine. Countless unsuccessful attempts to track down the monster have been made in the years since, notably in 2003 when the BBC funded an extensive scientific search that used 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking to sweep the full length of the loch. It concluded there was probably nothing there.</text>

	<text>AUSTIN (Texas): A flight attendant deployed an emergency evacuation slide on an airplane after it arrived in Houston and used it to exit a plane packed with passengers, an airline official said. "It is our understanding that she deployed it intentionally," said United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart, adding airline officials have been speaking with the flight attendant to see why she deployed the slide in the incident that took place on Monday. In a video shown on Houston TV station KPRC, the flight attendant tosses her bag out of a door behind the cockpit and slides down the slide. She grabs the bag and walks away from the plane, which was at full stop. A photo of the airplane on the station's website shows it at the gate, with the slide deployed on the side opposite of the gate. The flight, with 159 passengers and six crew members aboard, was from Sacramento to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The airplane, a Boeing 737-900, was briefly taken out of service for maintenance and then was returned to its scheduled use. The flight attendant, who was not identified by the airline, has been removed from flying duties. All the others aboard exited the plane without incident or injury.</text>

	<text>BANGKOK: A Thai woman has been charged with sedition, police said on Tuesday, after photos were spread of her holding a red bowl allegedly bearing a message from an ex-premier who lies at the heart of the kingdom's bitter politics. The images showed Theerawan Charoensuk, 54, holding a hand-sized bowl with a goodwill note apparently signed by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose powerful political dynasty is locked in a decadelong struggle with the kingdom's military-backed royalist elite. She faces up to seven years in jail if convicted. Her arrest comes as the ruling junta, who toppled a government led by Thaksin's sister in 2014, hardens its clampdown on political expression ahead of a referendum on a controversial charter it has penned. The small bowl is used to pour water during Buddhist ceremonies and was distributed at a temple fair in northern Chiang Mai, the Shinawatra's hometown. It was painted red  a colour with strong associations to the family's supporters, who are known as the "Red Shirts". Local media reported it was signed by Thaksin along with a slogan that read: "The situation may be hot, but brothers and sisters may gain coolness from the water inside this bucket". Police declined to comment on the details of the bowl, saying only that they believed it was handed out by a "certain political party". "She was charged with section 116  inciting chaos in the country," said Nateephat Akarapongthiti from Chiang Mai's Mae Ping police station. The junta has outlawed all political activities and protests since the coup, in a vow to bridge the kingdom's vast divides. But critics say the generals are more focused on rooting out the influence of the Shinawatras, who have dominated electoral politics for the past 10 years and are seen as a threat to the elite's status quo. Junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha told reporters Tuesday he found the charge was "suitable" because "it might be a national security threat". "It was [a show of] support for people who have violated laws and run away from criminal charge," he said, a reference to Thaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. Police said Theerawan, a Chiang Mai resident, was released from custody today and will now face trial in a military court. "She said she held up the bowl, but she didn't think that was wrong," Nateephat told AFP. Rights groups say the junta has increasingly leaned on the country's tough sedition law to silence critics.</text>

	<text>KAWASAKI: Japanese revellers carried giant phalluses through the streets of Kawasaki on Sunday to worship the humble penis and fertility in one of the world's most unusual festivals. Size matters at the Shinto Kanamara Matsuri, where groups of locals parade three heavy phalluses around the city  the biggest as tall as a full-grown man. Giggling festival-goers, including young children and grandmothers dressed in kimonos, sucked on penis lollipops and posed with phallus-shaped sculptures as political correctness was ignored for the day. An anatomically correct radish-carving contest drew a large crowd of sniggering onlookers, while blushing parents perched babies on a giant see-saw of frighteningly accurate likeness to pray for fertility. Tens of thousands gather every spring for the festival, where they can buy keepsakes such as key chains, trinkets, pens, chocolates and even toy glasses with a plastic penis nose. For the local priest of the Kanayama Shrine, however, it is no laughing matter. "If young children are not used to seeing (male genitalia), they could get into a bit of a panic when the time comes," Hiroyuki Nakamura told AFP, explaining the festival's educational role. "People come to pray for good fortune and to ask the gods to protect them. The festival is steeped in the past but has still has a valuable part to play in modern society." Known as the Festival of the Steel Phallus  or colloquially as the "Willy Festival"  legend has it that in the Edo Period (1603-1868) a sharp-toothed demon inhabiting a woman's vagina castrated several unfortunate young men on their wedding nights. A local blacksmith came to the rescue by forging an iron dildo to break the demon's teeth and today a three-foot (one-metre) black steel phallus sits in the shrine's courtyard to honour the Shinto deities of fertility, childbirth and protection from sexually transmitted infections. Over the centuries, sex workers also made a pilgrimage to the shrine to seek its powers of protection before the festival became a tourist attraction in the 1970s. "I think it's brilliant," said Sayuri Kubo, a 14-year-old schoolgirl proudly holding an erotic lollipop. "The mikoshi (portable shrine) parade was awesome." Three mikoshi are lugged through the streets of Kawasaki, including a giant pink phallus called Elizabeth, donated by a local drag queen club. There is a serious side to the frivolity, despite the bizarre sight of normally reserved Japanese housewives posing for snapshots with oversized dildos. Proceeds from sales of the saucy memorabilia go to HIV research while the shrine itself is visited year-round by married couples hoping to start a family. "It's about propagating the species," nursery school teacher Natsuki Kanayama told AFP, holding lollipops in both hands with another poking out of her cleavage. "I'm praying that I can have as many children as possible." Not surprisingly, however, the festival drew curious stares from visiting foreigners. "It's insane," said American tourist Jason Bradley. "I've heard about 'Cool Japan'  I guess this is what they mean."</text>

	<text>CAIRO: World Footballer of the Year Lionel Messi found himself the unlikely figure of controversy in Egypt after a local politician and a soccer official reacted angrily when he donated a pair of his boots to raise money for charity. MBC Masr channel broadcast an interview last Saturday with Barcelona's Messi on the television programme "Yes I am Famous", but the announcement that the Argentina forward would auction his boots for charity provoked an unexpected response. Member of parliament and television presenter Said Hasasin, appearing on his own talk show, took off his shoes and said he would donate them to the poor of Argentina. "Whose shoes do you want to sell, Messi? How much do you think it will get? You don't know that the nail of a baby Egyptian is worth more than your shoes? Keep your shoes to yourself or sell them to Israel." "Messi, we Egyptians are 90 million people, who have pride, we have shoes." "We don't eat off the money of other peoples' shoes. I would have understood if he donated his Barcelona uniform to the Egyptians, it's accepted. But just the shoes? It's humiliating to all Egyptians and I do not accept this humiliation. Egyptians may not find food, but they have pride." "We Egyptians have never been humiliated before during our seven thousand years of civilization." Throwing shoes is considered an insult in the Middle East. Hasasin called up Azmy Megahed, a spokesman for the Egyptian Football Association, on his programme, who added: "I am confused. If he (Messi) intends to humiliate us, then I say he'd better put these shoes on his head and on the heads of the people supporting him. We don't need his shoes and we don't need charity from Jewish or Israeli people. Give your shoes to your country, Argentina is full of poverty." MBC Masr's Mona El-Sharkawy who interviewed Messi said the gesture had been misinterpreted and that the donation was not for an Egyptian charity. "This is so false. It's a trend on our show that we take a souvenir from our guest and put it on auction for charity," El-Sharkawy was quoted as saying by news agency Ahram. "I am surprised, I didn't say we will be giving it to charity in Egypt or any other place. I don't know why they said he is presenting it to Egypt. This was never said." Messi has not commented on the reaction to his donation. Former Egypt forward Mido said he was grateful for Messi's gesture, writing on Twitter: "The most precious thing the writer owns is his pen ... and the most precious thing the footballer owns is his shoes. I hope we stop the false accusations."</text>

	<text>JOHANNESBURG: With their economy flatlining, currency on the ropes and politics in turmoil, many South Africans are turning to humour for relief, mainly at the expense of President Jacob Zuma and his $16-million home improvements. Within minutes of Zuma surviving Tuesday's heated impeachment vote in parliament thanks to unanimous support from African National Congress (ANC) loyalists, the 73-year-old traditionalist Zulu was facing another roasting on the nation's irreverent stand-up circuit. "Jacob Zuma is the dude who just threw up all over the dance floor but still doesn't want to go home," comedian Lazola Gola quipped, to roars of laughter at an open mike event at Kitchener's Bar, a 100-year-old watering hole built in the heyday of Johannesburg's gold rush. For comedians, Zuma is the gift that keeps on giving, a politician whose career has run the full gamut of scandal, from a love-child and corruption charges to foot-in-mouth insults of African countries and his belief, expressed during a 2006 rape trial, that having a shower can prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS. However, no episode has surpassed the six-year imbroglio over the "security upgrades" to his sprawling Nkandla private residence that included an amphitheatre, swimming pool, cattle enclosure and chicken run. Even though South Africa's top court said last week he had broken the constitution by disobeying a watchdog's order to pay back some money, Zuma has ploughed on, blaming his lawyers for giving bum advice and apologising for creating "confusion". That represented a rare moment of contrition from a leader who has mocked his non-Zulu opponents' pronunciation of Nkandla  rolling his eyes in parliament and dragging out the main syllable, 'Nkaaaaaaaandla'  and has criticized "clever blacks" for getting upset about the issue. Demonstrating political analysis as sharp as his wit, comedian Mojak Lehoko said Zuma's ability to ride out the constitutional court smack-down was no surprise. "This is a man who has survived more than 700 corruption charges and a rape case. There's no way he's going to jail over some home improvements and a swimming pool," he said backstage. Mad reality While much of South Africa's humour inevitably plays on the racial divides that remain two decades after apartheid  particularly between blacks and whites  the ruling ANC party and its leaders, past and present, are also frequent targets. Nor are there any sacred cows. In one Lehoko skit mocking the broken manner in which Zuma reads out large numbers in English, he and Mandela are sitting round a fire smoking marijuana, when the anti-apartheid leader accuses Zuma of hogging the joint. "Come on, Comrade Jacob, you know the rules  two puffs and pass it on," Mandela says. "But I've only had one ...," Zuma protests. "Thousand, seven hundred and twenty eight." Zuma's reputation for gaffes  in January his office had to correct his assertion Africa was bigger than all the other continents put together  is even starting to make waves internationally. South African host of "Daily Show", Trevor Noah, explained to US audiences this week how Zuma was elected in 2009 without ever being formally cleared by a court of hundreds of corruption charges. "I know, I know, that should have been a red flag to South Africans but ever since apartheid we've strived to be colour blind, so all we saw was a flag," Noah said. Others have taken the view that the politics of the self-styled "Rainbow Nation" have become so bizarre that satire is unable to compete with the real thing. "April Fools' Day 2016 cancelled till further notice," Daily Maverick, a respected online political magazine, wrote on April 1. "We couldn't come up with anything half as mad as SA reality today. Sorry."</text>

	<text>A morbidly obese Texas dachshund once dubbed "Fat Vincent" because his belly was so large it hit the ground when he walked, has found its way out of animal shelter care by dropping half its body weight, on track to become healthy enough for a new owner. The 7-year-old canine with a love for fast food weighed a whopping 38 pounds (17.24kg) with a body mass index of over 60 per cent body fat in September when he was surrendered to a Houston animal shelter after his elderly owner died, according to his foster mother. His ideal healthy weight is around 16 pounds. "Besides terribly high cholesterol and BMI, Vincent's back sloped downward in the middle and our vet was fearful that one false move would cause his back to break," said Melissa Anderson with K-9 Angels Rescue in Houston. The fat Texas dachshund once dubbed 'Fat Vincent' after dropping its weight. (K-9 Angels handout photo via Reuters) Now dubbed "Skinny Vinnie," the dog weighs 17.5 pounds due to a healthier diet, swimming with a life jacket in a pool and long walks, Anderson said, adding his fast food craving comes to life every time she goes to a drive-through window of a national coffee house chain. "He hops over to the driver's seat, sticks his head out the window and waits for the order," Anderson said. "He is always disappointed when the coffee arrives, but he never gives up hope."</text>

	<text>PANAJI: Former education minister and St Cruz MLA Atanasio 'Babush' Monserrate who was arrested last week on the charge of raping a minor girl filed a bail plea before the Children's Court on Saturday. The Children's Court will hear his bail application along with bail pleas of two other co-accused in the case on Monday. The two co-accused - the minor girl's mother and the third accused - allegedly sold the survivor to Monserrate. The St Cruz MLA has sought to be released on bail saying the complaint filed against him is totally baseless and false. He is innocent and not involved in any offence against the alleged minor girl or otherwise. However, he has admitted in his bail application that he was introduced to the minor girl in the second week of February, on the plea that she was in need of a job and he had referred her to his manager in-charge of one of his establishments where her services were engaged as a sales girl. However, her services were terminated after she allegedly stole cash from the store, he has said.</text>

	<text>Ahmedabad: The 12-member lion translocation committee has directed the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to revise the plan to move some Asiatic lions from Gujarat to Kuno Palpur in MP. The committee met in Delhi on Friday. The committee, which was formed following the apex court judgement of April 2013, has told the WII to consider concerns and objections raised by Gujarat. The apex court had directed that some lions should be moved from Gir to Kuno Palpur based on the guidelines of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The last meeting of parties concerned had been held more than a year ago. On Friday, the meeting buzzed with claims and counterclaims. Gujarat's contentions were challenged by MP officials. Sources said that when Gujarat raised an objection about the prey base density in Kuno, MP officials countered by saying that a study had been carried out by WII experts who were part of the meeting. After long discussions, the committee decided to meet again in June and will send the draft proposal prepared by Ravi Chellam and Y V Jhala - big cat experts and members of the committee - to the WII for revision. Sources said that the member of the National Tiger Conservation Authority said that the presence of lions in Kuno would not impede tiger movement from Ranthambore. And MP officials said that lions would be given precedence over tigers. However, the committee did not discuss possible lion-tiger conflicts. Sources said that MP asserted that Kuno was not the permanent home of tigers which used the area only as a transit point. But sources said that a tiger has been seen in Kuno for the past five years and other two others have been spotted frequently.</text>

	<text>New Delhi: This Independence Day, people flying between Gujarat and the US will get freedom from long and roundabout transit flights. Air India is going to fly direct from Ahmedabad to London Heathrow and the same aircraft will fly on to Newark - an airport in New Jersey that is in New York metropolitan area - from August 15, said a senior official. There has been a longstanding demand from the Gujarati community for a direct flight to London and a faster connection to the East Coast. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had during his London visit last November announced that AI will fly from Ahmedabad to London from December 15, 2015. AI did start that flight but it was not a direct one. Currently, we have an Ahmedabad-Mumbai London flight which very often involves a change of aircraft in Mumbai. This means flyers have to often get off the aircraft and then board another plane. From August 15, a Dreamliner will fly direct from Ahmedabad to London, onward to Newark and take the same route on return," said the official. Senior AI officials admit that while there has been a compelling business case for this flight but the "inspiration came from the PM and this flight is Modi's gift to the huge Gujarati community in UK and US." AI's decision comes close on the heels of Modi's visit to Washington early next month and during his previous visits to US and UK, the PM has announced AI flights to those countries while addressing the Indian diaspora there. AI has fifth freedom rights in UK, which means its Ahmedabad-UK-US flight can take passengers between London and Newark. "At present, we operate from Heathrow's terminal 3.But by September AI will operate out of the Heathrow's Star Alliance terminal, T2," said the official.</text>

	<text>Ahmedabad: To help Gujarati-medium students as well as those studying in other mediums for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), the state government will set up coaching centres across Gujarat at taluka headquarters. These centres will offer free coaching by teachers from the Central Board of Secondary Education schools, colleges, and by subject experts. The government wants students to be well prepared for the NEET, said education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma. GSHSEB vice-chairman R R Thakkar said that the biology syllabus of the Gujarat Board differed by about 20% from the central board in topics while the difference was only 5% in chemistry. The board will list the topics that Gujarat students need to focus on to crack the NEET. Thakkar said that for the 54,000 Gujarati-medium students, more than 10 sets of model question papers will be prepared. The papers and their keys will be available online. Officials from the board said that the NEET consists of a paper containing 180 objective-type questions (four options) from physics, chemistry, and biology (botany and zoology). Officials said that one-third of the questions are from biology while the other two section have equal weightage. The board has called in 50 teachers of each subject to prepare model papers. As for private coaching classes, they have begun short-term courses for NEET aspirants. The fees range from Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000. The managers of these classes said that they do not have Gujarati-medium teachers.</text>

	<text>VARANASI: Addressing the first convention of JD(U)'s UP unit at Pindra on Varanasi-Jaunpur border on Thursday, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make his stand clear on prohibition. Encouraged with an impressive gathering of party workers, Nitish said, "After successfully enforcing liquor ban in Bihar, I will launch anti-liquor campaign in UP at Lucknow on May 15. But, before launching this campaign, I seek the opinion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of ban on sale of liquor. Before becoming the PM, he was the CM of Gujarat where liquor is banned since the formation of the state and Modi also continued it. Now when he is in power at the Centre, Modi should make it clear why BJP-ruled states are not initiating measures to ban liquor." Nitish said: "On the demand of women in Bihar, I had promised them before 2015 assembly polls to ban liquor in the state after returning to power. I fulfilled my promise despite the fact that Bihar got a revenue of Rs 5000 crore from excise duty. I took this decision in the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha. As Modi is also continuing "Clean India campaign" to pay tributes to Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary in 2019, we seek his opinion on liquor ban as Gandhi was also against its consumption." Saying that he quit BJP's alliance because he did not want to compromise his principles, Nitish said, "all pre-poll promises of Modi including to bring back black money and payment of 50% profit with minimum support price of crops to farmers have proved to be false. As BJP has failed on economic and other fronts, it is raising sentimental issues to divert the attention of people from its failures. Today they are teaching nationalism despite the fact that they had no role in freedom struggle." Nitish mocked the decision of BJP-led NDA government to unfurl tricolour in all universities and said, "We see this decision of BJP as a victory of socialism as a party which carried 'Bhagva' (saffron flag) is now talking about national tricolour." Nitish also pitched for a strong anti-BJP Mahagathbandhan in UP before 2017 assembly polls. He said: "We are ready for any sacrifice to unite maximum number of political parties against the ideology of Sangh." While other JD(U) leaders like Sharad Yadav and KC Tyagi were harsh on Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, Nitish maintained a soft stand for SP and its supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav. He said, "I respect SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav a lot and we also made him the president of six-party alliance - Janata Parivar. At a time when a strong battle was being fought in Bihar against the BJP, Mulayam left us. But, we proved that BJP can be defeated. I don't make personal attacks on anyone but in case of UP, the performance of government should be judged on the scale of Lohia that what the last man of society has got in this state. I am still in favour of a strong anti-BJP alliance and invite all those parties, who are against the ideology of RSS, to join hands for ensuring the defeat of BJP in UP."</text>

They may not have earned the blue caps but cricketers from Porbandar have made a permanent place in Oman's national cricket team. Recently, Porbandar native Ajay Lalcheta was named captain of the Oman team which signalled its arrival on the international stage by defeating Ireland in the T20 World Cup. At least 20 youngsters have immigrated to the Middle East, mostly Oman, while 15 are settled in the UK, since a decade. All these cricketers have been groomed at Duleep School of Cricket, India's oldest and South Asia's first residential cricket school established by then Maharaja of Porbandar Natwarsinhji in 1947. "At least 15 youngsters from Porbandar are playing in various cricket teams in Oman alone. Nilesh Parmar was among the first cricketer from Porbandar to have played in Oman national team and is now a level 3 coach. Cricketers from Porbandar are in great demand in Gulf countries," said Ranjit Odedara, whose nephew Jayesh recently migrated to Oman. Six of the 11-member Al Turki Enterprise team that won Oman's prestigious Premier Division Knockout Tournament last week were from Porbandar. Manish Salet, who played for Oman and returned home in 2012, said, "Professional cricket has developed in the country and are giving lucrative salary packages to attract cricketers."</text>

Apple iPad Air 2, which currently has an MRP of Rs 45, 900, is available at a discounted price of Rs 40,190 on Amazon. Flipkart too is offering the tablet at a competitive price tag of Rs 40,849. It is not clear till how long the offer will run. Apple launched the iPad Mini 2 or the iPad Mini with Retina display in 2013. The tablet got a price cut last year when the company launched its iPad Air Pro along with the iPad Mini 4. The iPad Mini 2 currently comes at a MRP of Rs 21,900. However, as a part of the limited discount offer, Amazon and Flipkart are offering the tablet at Rs 17,990 and Rs 18,990. It is worth mentioning that both the iPad models available on discounts are the 16GB inbuilt storage variants with Wi-Fi-only connectivity. Apple acknowledges 1-year-old bug in iTunes Apple says it has not been able to reproduce the iTunes bug indicating that it is still clueless as to how to solve the problem. The company is already working on a patch fix. Flipkart is also offering a discount on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablet. The device that has been listed at a price of Rs 67,900, is available at a special discounted price of Rs 62,605. The discount is on the 32GB Wi-Fi only model. Apple is currently gearing up to launch its next iPhone models, likely to be called iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The upcoming iPhones, as per the latest leaks, will be featuring a dual camera setup. The images also reveal that the handsets might also ditch the antenna lines from the back panel. KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo, who has the best track record when it comes to Apple devices, recently said in a research note that Apple will ship a dual-lens iSight camera in all iPhone 7 Plus models. Kuo also predicts that iPhone 7 Plus will come with 3GB RAM, with Apple adding another gigabyte to the total RAM. However, iPhone 7 will come with 2GB RAM.</text>

	<text>LAS VEGAS: The world's largest IT storage company EMC, is in the race for developing smart cities in India, offering their services to the central and state governments, according to senior officials of the company. "We have already completed a health project for a state government to make hospitals smart and to provide real time information to the government for taking appropriate decision," Rajesh Janey, President, EMC India and Saarc, told the visiting Indian journalists. The project was done for Telengana, the newest state in India. "We are talking to the central government as well as state authorities to offer the hardware and software to make cities smart," Janey said. The Narendra Modi government had announced an initiative to develop 100 smart cities in India, with initial funds of Rs.7,000 crore being allocated for the project by the central government, though very little was actually spent. The project would be implemented by the state governments or city councils. EMC and Dell had announced a $67 billion merger in October, making it the largest tech alliance in history. The EMC World conference at the casino capital of the world was headed by Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO of Dell on Monday, that the merged entity would be called Dell Technologies while the enterprise company would be named Dell-EMC. Dell to buy EMC for $65 billion, a record takeover in tech In striking its roughly $65 billion deal, Dell and Silver Lake, are betting that a huge acquisition will help one of the best-known names in the industry keep up with the times. The merger is awaiting some regulatory approvals and is likely to be completed between June and October, according to the team set up to work out the logistics of two tech giants coming together. EMC has over 5,000 employees in India, largely in the engineering section, with offices in Bengaluru, Hyderbad, Delhi NCR and some tier-two towns. It provides storage, hardware and software to companies and did about $350 million (Rs.2,400 crore) business last year. The $25 billion EMC employs around 70,000 employees globally. EMC has set up a division on smart cities, whereby they are offering services for collating all data from health services, traffic, police, power infrastructure, municipalities, weather division, transport and government services collating data and bringing forth significant information which needed decisions. Also, the interface with citizens and those who seek services would become much easier, according to the officials. According to Rob Silverberg, Director and Chief Technology Officer, Enterprise Application Architecture for State, Local Government and Education at EMC California, the company is focussing on smart cities because it's the world of future. "We are talking to several cities and towns across the US to adopt what we have to offer," said Silverberg, adding it would help city officials do their job more effectively and efficiently. He said the Indian section of EMC was following up on the smart cities in India. EMC is competing in smart cities business in the US and other countries with IBM. Silverberg said that already a huge amount of data was being collected every day and every minute whether in crime tackling, traffic regulation or policing and other activities. "The data has to be stored and made intelligible for everyone so that right decisions are made quickly." Silverberg said the EMC smart cities project could even help track crimes and prepare evidence for courts whether it's through video monitoring data that has already been collected across the country or other methods. "Essentially, everything is data, and we are the experts who can help store and make sense of it," he said. According to Janey, the basic modules which the global company is now projecting to cities in various parts of the world, including Dubai, was made in Bengaluru by Indian software engineers. Janey said that EMC International had increased demand and the engineers in India came up with an effective solution which was adopted by the multinational.</text>

	<text>About time Blizzard Entertainment launched a new online multi-player game . The company, which has produced award winning titles like Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft, has finally come back into the gaming scene with a big launch. This time a shooter called Overwatch has been released in its beta stage by the company that has got gamers from everywhere downloading and playing it. The numbers are staggering and the company has already seen over 9.7 million gamers playing it. The love for first person shooting games is not over by a long shot and on the online front it seems to be growing. The open beta was available with 21 heroes from the full game, which saw over 81 million hours of play and 31 million matches. Greedy Games set to launch video-based ad integration The ad-tech startup is partnering with award-winning Czech Republic developer Mad Finger Games and Malaysian digital entertainment studio Mediasoft Entertainment. Overwatch is one of the biggest beta opening for Blizzard Entertainment and has left its competition Battleborn (by 2K Games) biting the dust. Battleborn was released to the world in early April this year and saw just 2 million gamers playing its beta. With close to 10 million gamers already hooked on to Overwatch, Blizzard Entertainment seems to be in for a treat. They will be launching the full version of game in last week of May and gamers can play it on multiple platforms such as PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. This just shows us how the online gaming industry has evolved and online gamers are increasing by the day. Global spending power on games also seems to be increasing, but will Blizzard be able to get the same or similar number of gamers buy and then play the full version of the game? That is something we will get to know in a few weeks time.</text>

	<text>Recently, Opera added VPN support to its browser . Now Opera browser has been updated with a new power saving feature that, according to the company's claims, can extend the laptop's battery life by up to 50%. "Depending on the type of your hardware, it can mean several hours of more browsing before you need to recharge your laptop," said Opera in a blog post. Activating the power saving feature is easy. When the laptop is unplugged from the mains power supply, a small battery icon automatically appears next to the search and address field in the Opera browser . Users just need to click on the battery icon to activate the power saving mode. Opera launches ad-blocker integration to desktop, Android Opera is adding integrated ad blocker to its browsers on both Windows PCs as well as to mobile, starting with Opera Mini browser for Android. In case you forget to switch on the power saving mode, the browser would automatically notify you to do so once the laptop's battery reaches at 20%. Opera says it has made several under-the-hood optimizations to deliver the power saving feature. The feature conserves power by actions such as reducing the background activity in tabs, waking the CPU less often and automatically disabling unused plug-ins. "In our tests, designed to reflect the way people use browsers in real life, the latest Opera developer version was able to run 50% longer than other browsers like Google Chrome on a laptop running Windows 10 64-bit," said Opera. The company has additionally worked on improving the browser's VPN experience. Based on user feedback, the company has combined browser's VPN feature with private browsing mode. The company has also resolved an issue where the original IP of the device could be found by the webpage through a WebRTC connection.</text>

	<text>LONDON: British researchers have designed a smartphone app that can help people manage their problems -- anxiety and depression -- based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The 'Catch It' app uses psychological approaches to mental health and well-being through CBT -- a therapy that can help individuals manage problems by changing the way one thinks and behaves. 'Catch It' helps the user identify thoughts and thinking styles associated with a shift in mood or a particular emotion and takes the users through a process referred to as "Catch it, Check it, Change it". Safety app for railway passengers The Government Railway Police (GRP), Pune, has introduced a web-based app - Pratisad - for providing quick response to commuters facing security issues on trains. The app helps users better understand their moods through use of an ongoing diary. "Our research examined the uptake and usage rates of this application along with the faithfulness of user responses to CBT principles and their impact on reported negative and positive moods," said Peter Kinderman, professor at University of Liverpool in Britain. App to map indoor spaces Three University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), Panjab University (PU) alumnus Rajat Kosh, Puneet Sikka and Rahul Bangar, with the help of their mentor and associate professor, UIET Dr Naveen Aggarwal have come up with an app which will guide you The findings of the initial trial, published in the British Journal of Psych Open, showed that there were statistically significant reductions in negative mood intensity and increases in positive mood intensity among participants. "This type of therapy cannot remove problems, but it can help people deal with them in a more positive way. It is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle," Kinderman added. "Smartphone apps have potential beneficial effects in mental health through the application of basic CBT principles. More research with randomised controlled trial designs should be conducted," Kinderman suggested.</text>

	<text>As widely rumoured, video calling feature on WhatsApp is coming soon -- rather very soon. The functionality has already made its appearance in WhatsApp Messenger app for Android for beta testers under the version 2.16.80. As expected, the WhatsApp video calling feature can be accessed by tapping on the phone icon placed at the top-right corner of the window inside a particular chat. While earlier tapping the icon directly initiated the voice calling, now tapping on the icon will give users the option to choose if they want to make a voice call or a video call to the person whose chat window is currently open. The option, for now, is only accessible from inside the chat window and not from the 'Calls menu'. WhatsApp for Web gets a much-needed feature, users can now share documents WhatsApp for Web now supports document sharing feature, which can be found as a part of the attachment icon on the top right corner of the chat window. Also, presently though users can see the 'video calling' option they will not be able to make the call. As, on tapping on the video calling option, the app says it cannot place the call and adds "Video Calling is unavailable at this time." However, it is not difficult to assume that the feature will be added soon as the option can now be seen inside the app. It is worth mentioning here that the beta testers can download this version from the Google Play store. Facebook -owned WhatsApp has so far not rolled out the beta-testing feature to iOS users. The world's most popular instant messaging app is also expected to soon receive the 'call back' feature that will allow users to give a 'call back' later to the users whose calls they missed without even opening the app. WhatsApp may also get the voice mailing feature, where users can record voice mails and send it to others. Zip file sharing feature is also rumoured for the instant messaging app. The company earlier this week rolled out the document sharing feature to its WhatsApp for Web platform. The document sharing option was made available for the Android and iOS apps last year.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Social media influencers are now solidifying their presence on various platforms like micro-blogging site Twitter as your friend or family member, leading to better positioning and boost in sales for various brands, a new study has revealed. Nearly 40% of respondents said that they have purchased an item online after seeing it used by an influencer on Instagram , Twitter , Vine or YouTube , said the study conducted by Twitter and market analytics firm Annalect. About 20% of respondents said they shared something they saw from an influencer while one-third of millennials (those born in two decades after 1980) reported that they follow a social media influencer on Twitter or Vine, adweek.com reported. Marketers are using social media influencers to build relationships with the people An influencer can reach consumers via blogs and social networks that brands may not be able to. Social media users lack sophistication Pictures, SMSs, videos and threats of violence  and the special trains to Guwahati were full. This week saw an exodus of people from northeast living in Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad and other cities following threats of violence for alleged atrocities against Bangladeshi migrants in the eastern Indian state. Some time ago, "marketers would put household names on the front of cereal boxes," Jeffrey Graham, vice president of market research and insights at Twitter , was quoted as saying. "Now, online influencers can sell other products to anyone with a smartphone," Graham added. For the results, the researchers surveyed more than 300 users to see how they responded toward brand influencers. How social media influences health Addicted to checking your Twitter follower count every five minutes, and sending Facebook friend invites to people you met for all of two seconds? In the second part of the study, the team studied how 500 users exposed to display ads and other traditional digital formats compared with watching content from a social media influencer. The number of influencers from various walks of life had also dramatically increased on various social media platforms, the authors noted. "This is telling us is that you don't have to be a mass media star or a household name to be influential and actually drive people to buy stuff," Graham noted. According to Twitter-owned talent agency Niche, the number of social media influencers available to brands has grown from 6,000 to over 25,000 in a year.</text>

	<text>iBall, after marking its presence in the smartphone and tablet segment, finally entered the laptop market by launching two new computing devices under its CompBook series. Earlier this week, the company launched the CompBook Excelance and the CompBook Exemplaire laptops priced at Rs 9,999 and Rs 13,999 respectively. We are yet to test how the laptop performs in real-world usage.The two laptops largely have the same set of specifications, except for the screen sizes - 11-inch and 14-inch. The smaller CompBook Excelance was the highlight of the launch event and now holds the title of the cheapest Windows 10 laptop available in India. We are yet to test the laptops in detail. However, during the limited time spent with them, we found the laptops to be just about right for the price point. As the cheapest Windows 10 laptop in India, the CompBook Excelance seems too good to be true. It has an 11-inch IPS antiglare display with a tactile chiclet keyboard. The display has great viewing angles too. Although the laptop's made out of plastic, it still feels sturdy. It is also light weight and highly portable. 5 key features of the cheapest Windows 10 laptop in India The new iBall CompBook Excelance is priced at Rs 9,999 and is also the cheapest Windows 10 laptop avaialble in India. The computing device includes a massive battery, latest Microsoft Windows OS, dual speakers and more. On the software side, you get Microsoft Windows 10 and all the features the OS comes with. These include Microsoft Edge browser, Cortana integration, universal apps and more. Under-the-hood, iBall CompBook Excelance packs a quad-core Intel Atom Z3735F processor clocked at 1.83GHz. It also comes with 2GB of RAM and Intel HD graphics. We tried some apps on the display unit and it handled them with ease. However, it is too early to jump to any conclusions as we are yet to review it. On the storage front, both laptops come with 32GB of in-built space of which a good amount is taken by Windows 10. iBall could've done better in this department as 32GB will likely not be enough for users. However, they have the option to add a microSD card up to 64GB for expansion. iBall CompBook laptops come with a VGA resolution webcam for video chats, and they have a microSD slot, a Mini HDMI port and 2 USB 2.0 ports. Another highlight of India's cheapest Windows 10 laptop is its large 10,000mAh battery, which is claimed by the company to last up to 8.5 hours on a single charge. We are yet to see how the battery performs in our tests, so stay tuned for the full review soon. If you are still confused as to which budget laptop to buy, here is our list of the cheapest laptops currently available in India.</text>

	<text>A draft of the Geospatial Information Regulation Bill 2016, released recently for public comment, makes it mandatory to take permission from a government authority before acquiring, disseminating and publishing or distributing any geospatial information of India . Basically use of the map of India would require government permission first. The ministry of home affairs' proposed bill seeks to make addition of map-related information or creation of even maps and sharing of location and map-related data illegal without a license. Cold response from MNCs like Google to India's security concerns is seen as a prime reason for the proposed legislation. However, experts have slammed the proposed bill saying it will bring back days of licence Raj and create hurdles in business and technological development for companies. Here's a ready-reckoner on the proposed bill. What does the act say? Who will need permission? As per the act, "Any person who wants to acquire, disseminate, publish or distribute any geospatial information of India, may make an application alongwith requisite fees to the Security Vetting Authority for security vetting of such geospatial information and licence thereof to acquire, disseminate, publish or distribute such Geospatial Information in any electronic or physical form." In case one already has the data: Within a year of this Act coming into effect, you'll have to apply for a license, pay a fee, and seek permission from "Security Vetting Authority for retaining such geospatial information". Who all are impacted? The bill will not only affect companies like Google who have mapping tools like Google Maps , but also bring into its ambit other companies using maps for professional purposes like taxi-hailing services Ola, Uber (plot location on map); travel companies (map out properties offer mapped guides); WhatsApp (allows users to share location with friends); ecommerce delivery service providers (plot packages on a map) and many others. It also includes anyone with a GPS-enabled smartphone as well as users of smartphones and laptops with in-built GPS. What is the Security Vetting Agency? The Security Vetting Authority shall consist of an officer of the rank of joint secretary to the government of India or above as chairman and two members, one, a technical expert and the other, a national security expert.

Why the criticism Experts are slamming The bill saying, one, it may be highly impractical for each smartphone user to get a licence. Two, It will see all business dependent on real-time navigation as illegal. Three, larger companies have money to go through security vetting, but upstarts may not have it so easy. Four, the bill goes against some of the ongoing projects like smartcities, which plan to harness geospatial information for smooth functioning.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Logging on to social media sites such as Facebook , Instagram and Twitter frequently may increase the risk of eating disorders and distorted body shape in young adults, a study has warned. Gender, specific age, race and income does not influence the association, researchers said. "We have long known that exposure to traditional forms of media, such as fashion magazines and television, is associated with development of disordered eating. Social media combines many of the visual aspects of traditional media with the opportunity for social media users to interact and propagate stereotypes, thus having the same effect," said Jaime Sidani from University of Pittsburgh in the US. Researchers sampled 1,765 adults between ages 19 to 32 in 2014. The questionnaires asked about the 11 most popular social media platforms at the time. They crossreferenced those results with the results of another questionnaire that used established screening tools to assess eating disorder risk. Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other clinical and mental health issues. Participants who spent the most time on social media had 2.2 times the risk of reporting eating and body image concerns, compared to their peers who spent less time on social media, researchers said. Researchers noted that the analysis could not determine whether social media use was contributing to the disorder or vice versa or both. "It could be that young adults who use more social media are exposed to more images and messages that encourage development of disordered eating," said Brian A Primack .</text>

	<text>BENGALURU | NEW DELHI: Last year, 12 female undergraduate students across two institutes in Bengaluru were nominated to be part of a pilot project at Dell . These young women  from the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering and RV College of Engineering  weren't necessarily class toppers, but students their institutes thought could benefit from the practical knowledge and training, something that Dell was ready to provide. Employees at Dell worked with these students on the 'Girl Student Outreach Programme' over a course of 25 weeks, educating them on the skills required to work in the IT industry, encouraging them to work on networking skills and inculcating confidence in them. The participants were taken through basic programming languages and worked on a project on computing, networking and storage. No salary hike for freshers in IT industry Despite marginal salary hikes offered by US-based Cognizant  followed by TCS  last year, experts say that the range of salaries still largely remains the same. Dell is just one of the companies seeking to correct a problem that's becoming more prevalent  that of dwindling numbers of women in the technology field. With not enough women opting for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education, and many women employees dropping out of the workforce mid-career to focus on family-related commitments, technology companies in India are facing a severe crunch of female talent. However, companies such as Accenture, VMware, Intel, Intuit and Pitney Bowes are among those battling this trend, not only by hiring more female talent, but also by introducing unique initiatives in this area. In October last year, Pitney Bowes introduced 'PB Code Inspire', a three-month hackathon specifically conducted for women from colleges across India. "Over 2,000 students participated in the coding challenge, and we selected the top five winners, who were given job offers. Female talent in technology needs to be identified and encouraged right at the college level," said Manish Choudhary, managing director, India and SVP, innovation, Pitney Bowes. The hackathon will now be an ongoing annual initiative, and this year will reach double the number of colleges and participants compared to last year, he said. While Dell and Pitney Bowes are focusing on developing female talent in technology at an early level, Accenture, Intel and VMware are providing employee guidance and backing to further their careers. New-age IT skills can double your pay If you have some of the new-age tech skills, not only are you likely to be hired much faster, you could also earn far better salaries, according to data from Simplilearn, an online education provider of professional certification training. Last year, Accenture's Delivery Centers for Technology in India rolled out the 'High-Tech Women' programme, which aims to see more women make the journey as technical architects and take part in leadership roles. Women in Accenture's Delivery Centers for Technology are now getting organisational commitment, investment and backing to advance their careers. Under the mentoring programme, each of Accenture's technology leaders spends 18 months serving as a mentor to two women who are at mid-career levels. Currently, the company has about 1,100 women enrolled in the programme. Bhaskar Ghosh, group chief executive of Accenture Technology Services, says the organisation has also pledged to grow the percentage of new women hires to at least 40% worldwide by 2017. Currently, women account for 33% of the workforce. Intel India, too, facilitates the professional growth of existing talent. It runs the 'Protege Sponsorship Initiative', which aims to create development opportunities for select senior technical women employees by mapping each of them to a senior leader as sponsors. TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL and Cognizant hirings fall 24%: Report The Big Five software exporters -- TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL and Cognizant -- together added net 24% fewer employees in 2015 at 77,265, thanks to their automation drive. "These sponsors act as their advocates and undertake targeted interventions that include influencing their job scope, creating networking opportunities and ongoing coaching. Around 15 senior technical women employees have already been part of this initiative," said Nivruti Rai, general manager, Intel India. Recently, VMware partnered with global non-profit Women Who Code (WWCode) to empower women to succeed in technology. The WWCode Bangalore chapter has held hack nights, educational seminars, study groups and presentations. "There are currently 823 women that are connected through the network, all working to support one another in their professional endeavours. By partnering with WWCode, VMware hopes to promote innovation that is driven by diversity and ensure that women are empowered to grow in their careers," said Shwetha Lakshman Rao, MTS-3 at VMware and city director-Women Who Code Bangalore. At product and software firm Intuit, the Intuit Women's Network (IWN) delivers programmes that offer development opportunities for members to build strong leadership capabilities. "IWN also enables women to submit research papers, and participation of women leaders as speakers in the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in India (GHCI)  the country's largest gathering of women technologists," said Somnath Baishya, director and head-HR, Intuit India. And then, of course, there's the issue of women dropping out of the workforce to focus on major life events such a motherhood. Taking cognisance of the talent that drops out, companies are rolling out programmes for mothers looking to return to work. TCS, Wipro to soon join HCL in $1 billion engineering services club Indian IT behemoths TCS and Wipro are close to entering the $1-billion club in engineering services. HCL Technologies is currently the only Indian player in that league. In 2015, Intuit rolled out 'Intuit Again' -- a programme aimed at providing an opportunity for women technologists who have taken a break in their careers to come back to work. The six-month training programme helps train and sharpen participants' professional skills. Out of 11 women interns last year, five were recruited and placed in software engineering, business development and system engineering roles. This year, the firm is recruiting 10 interns from the programme. At Accenture, the Women's Alumni Network  launched on International Women's Day last year  is available for those who have been on a career break for two to three years. The company has revamped its re-hiring process, making the process simpler for women alumni. Similarly, Intel runs the 'Home to Office' programme, started two years back, to enable women professionals to resume their career after a break necessitated by life events such as motherhood, family relocation, etc.</text>

	<text>Apple iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 2 tablets have received a price cut online. The discounted price tag on the two devices can be seen on leading etailer websites - Amazon and Flipkart. Apple iPad Air 2, which currently has an MRP of Rs 45, 900, is available at a discounted price of Rs 40,190 on Amazon . Flipkart too is offering the tablet at a competitive price tag of Rs 40,849. It is not clear till how long the offer will run. Apple launched the iPad Mini 2 or the iPad Mini with Retina display in 2013. The tablet got a price cut last year when the company launched its iPad Air Pro along with the iPad Mini 4. The iPad Mini 2 currently comes at a MRP of Rs 21,900. However, as a part of the limited discount offer, Amazon and Flipkart are offering the tablet at Rs 17,990 and Rs 18,990. It is worth mentioning that both the iPad models available on discounts are the 16GB inbuilt storage variants with Wi-Fi-only connectivity. Apple acknowledges 1-year-old bug in iTunes Apple says it has not been able to reproduce the iTunes bug indicating that it is still clueless as to how to solve the problem. The company is already working on a patch fix. Flipkart is also offering a discount on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablet. The device that has been listed at a price of Rs 67,900, is available at a special discounted price of Rs 62,605. The discount is on the 32GB Wi-Fi only model. Apple is currently gearing up to launch its next iPhone models, likely to be called iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The upcoming iPhones, as per the latest leaks , will be featuring a dual camera setup. The images also reveal that the handsets might also ditch the antenna lines from the back panel. KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo, who has the best track record when it comes to Apple devices, recently said in a research note that Apple will ship a dual-lens iSight camera in all iPhone 7 Plus models. Kuo also predicts that iPhone 7 Plus will come with 3GB RAM, with Apple adding another gigabyte to the total RAM. However, iPhone 7 will come with 2GB RAM.</text>

	<text>2K Games and Firaxis have announced the next iteration of their Civilization video game . Dubbed Civilization vi, the game title will be releasing on October 21 this year on PC. This time the creators have brought an art style design to the game as the building, military units and other elements are all available in bright colours. Civilization VI will also be featuring a new painting-like terrain look, something which was not there in the previous Civilization V. In Civilization VI, cities will now be more detailed than before as they will be divided in to various districts. This will also let gamers fully use the terrain. In addition, making use of different terrains will result in more strategic planning when attacking a city. Until the Civilization V, gamers would have to build military buildings and place their troops inside one hexagonal tile. "We want to stop players from falling into patterns," said game director Ed Beech in a statement to CNET. "We want players to build their empires differently every time." The gamers will also see the farmland, factories, and markets separated in different tiles. Also, in Civilization VI gamers would now get the option to boost the research system. This can be done by accomplishing certain side missions. Until now, users had to wait for researching technologies through the science tree. Beech added that the cities will now be unfolding in a different way than before. "Each time you settle your first city, start producing food, gold, culture, science, and everything vital to growth, we want it to feel different. We want you to consider your military differently. We want to encourage new approaches. We want it to feel like a new experience each time." The creators are also actively working on other features such as units that support battalions, better multiplayer gaming and diplomacy system to learn methods used by other leaders. In Civilization VI, gamers will start the game with Stone Age civilization leading up to the Information Age. For those playing for the first time, the game will also feature a new tutorial video to make them familiar with the gameplay.</text>

	<text>Till a year ago, Micromax phones were among the best choices for anyone wanting to buy a well-rounded smartphone without burning a hole in his/her pocket. Fast forward to the present, it's no longer the case. Thanks to the recent onslaught of Chinese brands (e.g. Xiaomi, Coolpad), Indian customers now have more choice than ever when it comes to 'value for money' smartphones. As a result, Micromax now finds itself facing increasingly stiff competition. Probably this is why the company recently announced a complete overhaul of its marketing strategy, along with a new logo and tagline. But more importantly, it also launched two brand new flagship smartphones - Canvas 6 and Canvas 6 Pro to carry forward that vision. We tested the Canvas 6 for a few days to see what Micromax's latest smartphone has to offer. So, at Rs 13,999, does the Canvas 6 have what it takes to make a dent in the hugely competitive Indian smartphone market? Check out our detailed review to find out. Design and build quality Even if it takes design cues from existing smartphones, there's no denying the fact that Micromax Canvas 6 is quite a looker. The smartphone has a full-metal unibody design and chamfered edges that lend it a gorgeous appearance. While the front panel is all about the 5.5-inch display, it is also home to the earpiece, front-facing camera, notification LED and the usual array of sensors. One downer is that the display doesn't have the whole 2.5D curved design. Turn to the rear, and you'll immediately see the previously mentioned design cues. With its primary camera peeking from behind the centre of a black bar on the top edge of the phone, the Canvas 6 looks a lot like Huawei's Nexus 6P. Just below the camera module is a single LED flash, followed by the fingerprint sensor. Other than that, the slightly curved back has just the refreshed Micromax logo and a self-declaration text that probably no one cares about printed on it. READ ALSO: ?Micromax launches Canvas XP 4G smartphone in India: Price, specifications &amp; features revealed The top edge has the 3.5 mm audio jack, whereas the bottom edge houses the speaker and the micro-USB port. The left edge has a pull-out tray for putting in a nano-sim and a microSD card and the right edge is where you'll find the volume rocker and the power button, both of which provide good tactile feedback. Overall, the fit and finish of the Micromax Canvas 6 is definitely one of the best you can find at this price point. Display Micromax Canvas 6 sports a 5.5-inch Full HD display of 1080x1920 pixels resolution, with the pixel density coming around at around 401ppi. The IPS LCD panel reproduces colours accurately along with good contrast levels, with viewing angles being great as well. The smartphone comes with 'MiraVision' feature, which is a set of software engines that let you fine tune image parameters like contrast, colour saturation and dynamic contrast to enhance picture quality. That said, sunlight legibility isn't really that good and you'll need to crank up the brightness quite a bit to see the content on the screen under direct sunlight. Nevertheless, the Full HD display of Micromax Canvas 6 will serve you well for watching HD videos and playing games. Performance and camera Delivering muscle to the Micromax Canvas 6 is a MediaTek Helio X10 octa-core processor backed by 3GB RAM. There's also 32GB of on-board storage that can be further expanded up to 128GB via microSD cards. The overall performance of the phone was great during our testing. Running multiple apps and juggling between them proved to be a non-issue. As for games, the Canvas 6 handled everything from Asphalt 8 to N.O.V.A. 3 like a pro. However, the phone did heat up a little after a few minutes of continuous gaming. Talking about the call quality, we didn't face any problems while making or receiving calls with the device. The phone latched on to the mobile network pretty quickly and reception was generally good, even in problematic areas like stairways and underground parking lots. And since the phone is 4G capable, general network speeds were great overall too. Other connectivity options include 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS. Having a 13MP primary camera equipped with LED flash and phase detection auto focus and an 8MP front-facing shooter, the Canvas 6 seems to be ideal for those who take a lot of photos with their smartphones. And for the most part, it's true. In brightly lit conditions, the smartphone's rear camera managed to click some really good shots with natural looking colours and ample amount of detail. However, images clicked in low-light conditions were terrible, with visible amounts of digital noise. As far as the selfie camera is concerned, it produced fine looking selfies and worked equally well with video calling apps. The Canvas 6's camera app sports a clean UI without sacrificing on features. From face detection to automatic scene selection and from anti-shake to HDR mode, the camera app has it all. Then there are features like Live Photos (such as the ones in the latest iPhones), continuous motion tracking and a number of image filters. The phone is capable of recording Full HD (1080p) videos, and recorded videos look and play fine too. But for some weird reason, the videos are saved in the ancient 3GP file format. Another pain point of the Canvas 6 is the fingerprint sensor, which proved to be a hit-or-miss affair during our testing. Registering fingerprints (for both left and right hand digits) took more effort than it should have. Once that was done, unlocking the phone too required pressing the finger against the sensor really hard. If you're used to unlocking your smartphone with fingerprints, the Canvas 6 will probably be a disappointing experience. Coming to the software side of things, the Micromax Canvas 6 runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Although the user experience is almost entirely similar to that of stock Android, the OS has a few additions here and there. For example, the default keyboard app included with the operating system is SwiftKey. It takes a little while getting used to, but is really handy. The phone also comes with Micromax's 'AroundYou' service that curates real-time information from numerous apps. The information shown by 'AroundYou' includes flight updates, nearby hotels and more. The service is accessible by swiping the homescreen to the right, just like Google Now. READ ALSO: Micromax Canvas 6 smartphone up for pre-order Micromax's Canvas 6 comes pre-loaded with popular music streaming app Gaana, along with a six month trial of the app's premium subscription that lets you download unlimited songs in high-definition quality. There are also few third party apps (e.g. Quikr, Scandid) pre-installed on the phone; however, not all of them can be uninstalled. To wrap things up, the phone's 3000 mAh battery lasted around a day of average use. But if you plan on using the Canvas 6 for lots of calling, heavy gaming and web browsing, it'll be better to lug a power bank around. Verdict The Micromax Canvas 6 has been launched in a fiercely-contested market. It has to rub shoulders with a bagload of Chinese Android smartphones that are not just affordable, but also feature-loaded. Although the Canvas 6 is arguably Micromax's best smartphone till date, it's not something that will make the smartphone world go crazy. Its premium fit and finish are marred by a flawed fingerprint sensor and below average camera quality in poorly lit conditions. To sum it up, the Micromax Canvas 6 isn't a value for money device. As an alternative, you can consider the 3GB RAM/32GB in-built storage variant of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The Redmi Note 3 comes with a build quality that's comparable to the Canvas 6, a fingerprint sensor that actually works and a bigger battery, all at a cheaper price.

If you're used to unlocking your smartphone with fingerprints, the Canvas 6 will probably be a disappointing experience. Coming to the software side of things, the Micromax Canvas 6 runs Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. Although the user experience is almost entirely similar to that of stock Android, the OS has a few additions here and there. For example, the default keyboard app included with the operating system is SwiftKey. It takes a little while getting used to, but is really handy. The phone also comes with Micromax's 'AroundYou' service that curates real-time information from numerous apps. The information shown by 'AroundYou' includes flight updates, nearby hotels and more. The service is accessible by swiping the homescreen to the right, just like Google Now. READ ALSO: Micromax Canvas 6 smartphone up for pre-order Micromax's Canvas 6 comes pre-loaded with popular music streaming app Gaana, along with a six month trial of the app's premium subscription that lets you download unlimited songs in high-definition quality. There are also few third party apps (e.g. Quikr, Scandid) pre-installed on the phone; however, not all of them can be uninstalled. To wrap things up, the phone's 3000 mAh battery lasted around a day of average use. But if you plan on using the Canvas 6 for lots of calling, heavy gaming and web browsing, it'll be better to lug a power bank around. Verdict The Micromax Canvas 6 has been launched in a fiercely-contested market. It has to rub shoulders with a bagload of Chinese Android smartphones that are not just affordable, but also feature-loaded. Although the Canvas 6 is arguably Micromax's best smartphone till date, it's not something that will make the smartphone world go crazy. Its premium fit and finish are marred by a flawed fingerprint sensor and below average camera quality in poorly lit conditions. To sum it up, the Micromax Canvas 6 isn't a value for money device. As an alternative, you can consider the 3GB RAM/32GB in-built storage variant of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. The Redmi Note 3 comes with a build quality that's comparable to the Canvas 6, a fingerprint sensor that actually works and a bigger battery, all at a cheaper price.</text>

	<text>Chinese smartphone maker Meizu recently launched a new budget handset in the Indian market - the M3 Note. The smartphone is priced at Rs 9,999 and comes with a well-rounded spec sheet, including a 5.5-inch Full HD display, 3GB RAM as well as 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras. But good specifications don't translate to a good smartphone experience automatically, so we spent some days with the Meizu M3 Note to find out more. Here are our observations Design and display Meizu M3 Note sports a design that looks quite inspired from the iPhone 6. Crafted out of aluminium, it is the first smartphone in Meizu's M-series to sport an all metal body. The front is dominated by a 5.5-inch Full HD display of 1080x1920 pixels resolution adorned by a 2.5D curved glass design. It also has a physical home button that doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. However, the sensor failed to unlock the phone several times during our testing. Other components on the front panel include the 5MP selfie camera, earpiece and the usual collection of sensors. READ ALSO: Meizu launches M3 Note smartphone in India at Rs 9,999 The volume rocker and power button are placed on the right edge of the phone and the sim tray is on the left. The top edge houses 3.5mm audio jack while the microUSB port and speakers are at the bottom edge. To sum things up, Meizu M3 Note has a design that's ordinary but still pleasant to look at. Talking about the display of the phone, we found it to be very responsive. The display is capable of producing bright and vibrant colours; however, we were not very happy with the viewing angles. The screen is also pretty reflective and thus hard to see under direct sunlight. Performance and camera Meizu M3 Note is powered by a 1.8GHz MediaTek Helio P10 processor and comes with 3GB of RAM. There's 32GB of internal storage and it can be further expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card. The smartphone packs a 4,100mAh battery and includes 4G, LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC as its connectivity options. Meizu M3 Note runs Android 5.1 Lollipop skinned with the company's own Flyme OS. The skin is heavily customized and everything from app icons to notification shade looks different from what it does in stock Android. That said, we couldn't help but notice the similarity Flyme OS bears with Apple's iOS. For instance, instead of the 'back' icon, the UI has an arrow on the top left edge. The heavy customization also hampers the phone's performance a little bit. READ ALSO: Meizu M3 Note first impressions: Impressive design, decent specifications M3 Note's app drawer is integrated with homescreen, and the phone comes preloaded with some of its own apps. However, what's surprising is that unlike most Android phones, it doesn't come with standard Google apps. We had to go to the Google Play Store and download YouTube, Gmail and other essentials. Even Gmail didn't run properly till we used it via the 'Email' app on the phone. Meizu M3 Note also includes handy gesture controls. For example, you can double tap the screen to unlock the phone and swipe horizontally to switch tracks. The gestures worked fine during our testing. Call quality on the Meizu M3 Note was good and we didn't face any problems, even in areas with low signal reception. On the battery front, the phone's non-removable 4,100mAh battery lasted up to a day and a half of moderate usage. For heavy users, it'll likely last through a whole day. Gaming also proved to be one of the sore points of the Meizu M3 Note, primarily because of the heating issues that we encountered after a few minutes of continuous gameplay. As far as the cameras go, the 13MP rear shooter is surely not the crown jewel of the Meizu M3 Note. While we were happy with the overall image quality, colour reproduction wasn't really that good. Interestingly, the 5MP selfie camera fared better during our testing. Verdict The Meizu M3 Note really left us with a mixed bag of emotions. While the phone's design and battery life are all favourable, the overall performance and camera quality turned out to be disappointing. Even the fingerprint sensor was not very responsive.

	<text>NEW DELHI: Samsung is reportedly working on a new C series of Galaxy smartphones . Specifications of two unannounced models - Galaxy C5 and Galaxy C7 were recently leaked. The upcoming handsets are expected to be priced in between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000. According to Android Headlines, both Galaxy C5 and C7 will feature a metal unibody design with 5.2-inch and 5.7-inch displays respectively. Screen resolution on both handsets will be Full HD at 1080x1920 pixels. The report further states that hardware specifications of both the smartphones will be same too. The major difference, however, will be of size. Moto G4 specs leak in benchmarks The Moto G4 smartphone appeared in a benchmarking website revealing some key specifications such as Qualcomm Snapdragon process, 3GB RAM and more. Samsung's Galaxy C series of smartphones will reportedly come with Android Marshmallow preloaded on them. Hardware specifications of the smartphones include 64-bit Snapdragon 617 octa-core processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB built-in storage, along with a 16MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing shooter. Micromax Canvas 6 Review: Good, but nothing groundbreaking Till a year ago, Micromax phones were among the best choices for anyone wanting to buy a well-rounded smartphone without burning a hole in his/her pocket. The company recently launched the 2016 edition of its 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab A. Officially launched in Germany , there's no word on the tablet's availability in India. The tablet comes in two variants -- Wi-Fi and LTE, priced at EUR 289 and EUR 349 respectively. Apart from 4G sim support, both versions feature same hardware specifications. Creo Mark 1 smartphone review: A promising start Useful software features and monthly updates are the primary USPs of the Creo Mark 1. But at a price tag of Rs 19,999, the Creo Mark 1 is unconvincing. Nevertheless, its a promising device. The tablet has a 10.1-inch TFT display with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels and weighs 525 grams. Running the latest Android Marshmallow, the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016) is powered by a 1.6GHz octa-core processor paired with 2GB RAM. There's 16GB of internal storage with support for microSD cards up to 200GB.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Reliance Industries has started handing out increments and bonuses to its 20,000 employees with junior &amp; middle managers receiving raises of 8-10%. Letters were issued to these employees on Friday, while senior managers will receive theirs along with variable pay this week. RIL had reported a net profit of Rs 7,398 crore in the March quarter, the highest in eight years. It paid 100% of variable pay or annual cash bonus (ACB) to junior and middle managers. This is higher than what they have given till now, said a person aware of the development. Last year, the increment was a few notches lower and the variable pay was around 85%. Reliance Jio's 4G launch may not impact Airtel's revenue share: Report Drawing parallels between Reliance Jio's current playbook and Reliance Communications' 2003 launch, Deutsche Bank Markets Research has said Bharti Airtel appears to be better prepared with its 4G plans and it does not anticipate any impact on its revenue share or margins from the Jio launch. However, employees of Reliance Jio may see a delay in increments as the review letters are expected to be sent in June. According to people with direct knowledge of the development, the firm announced FY15 increments for Jio in April-May last year and variable pay was given in October. The group wants to bring in a clear difference between its core business and Jio-based on performance. Their main business did well this quarter,US said the person cited above. Reliance Jio: Half a million users, 18GB average monthly data use Reliance, Reliance Jio, Reliance Jio launch, Jio speds, Jio 4G connection, Reliance Jio 4G price, 4G data, internet, technology news The oil-to-retail conglomerate ranks its employees alphabetically -the top rung falls in the A category, while B is one notch lower and so on. Around 60-70% of an employee's salary is fixed and the rest of it is variable pay or ACB.This variable pay is based on three elements -the performance of the parent (RIL), the relevant business or unit and employee rating. Some employees have received more than 100% of ACB as their division has performed exceptionally well in the past year. Reliance Jio: High-bandwidth cable linking India &amp; SEA, ME operational Reliance Jio has announced commencing of operations of the 100 Gigabits per second Bay of Bengal Gateway (BBG) submarine cable system. US Reliance Industries has a worldclass performance and rewards programme in line with international best practices which it stands committed to implementing each year,US a company spokesperson said in an email without giving details. This programme has yielded rich dividends and continues to enhance RIL's reputation as an employer of choice. The company is seeking to build talent at the senior level after a few exits from its human resource (HR) department. Under its Career Accelerated Program (CAP), the group will allow employees to chart their career growth by changing business functions after a series of tests and interviews. The Step Up Program will help an employee grow within the same function, with the help of mentoring.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: We all use USB flash drives on a regular basis. Commonly referred to as pen drives, these tiny USB sticks are used for everything from storing (and transferring) data to running portable apps. Flash drives are really convenient, thanks to their small size and universal compatibility. But their small form factor also means that flash drives are easily lost, misplaced, or stolen. And if a misplaced or stolen flash drive has some valuable information stored on it, it could be disastrous in the wrong hands. So it's really important that you secure USB flash drives (and the data stored on them) against such situations. Here are some of the best software applications that you can use to password protect flash drives. Most of these programs also encrypt the data stored on flash drives. 1. VeraCrypt VeraCrypt is based on the now defunct TrueCrypt, a powerful encryption tool. Although it's primarily meant for encrypting hard disks, it works equally well for flash drives. The application creates password protected volumes on flash drives by encrypting them with strong algorithms like AES and Twofish. The step-by-step volume creation wizard makes things easy. In addition to an encryption password, you can also specify a keyfile for more security. Encrypted flash drives can be only accessed through VeraCrypt, after specifying the correct password. WhatsApp encryption breakdown: 8 things you need to know now The latest version of the app will use security technology that means that messages can't be intercepted as they travel between devices. 2. DiskCryptor DiskCryptor is a feature loaded disk encryption software that does a good job of protecting USB flash drives too. Compared to VeraCrypt, it's a bit simpler. It's easy to use DiskCryptor. Just plug-in the flash drive to be encrypted, enter necessary parameters like password and encryption algorithm and DiskCryptor will handle everything else. It supports all popular encryption algorithms like AES and Twofish. DiskCryptor can even encrypt optical discs and the system bootloader. 3. Rohos Disk Encryption Rohos Disk Encryption is lightweight, but boasts an extensive feature set. It's one of the best utilities you can use for password protecting and encrypting flash drives. Based on the size of the plugged-in flash drive, the software automatically detects the best size of the encrypted volume to be created on it. However, you can also specify a custom size. You can also dynamically change the size of the encrypted volumes. Rohos Disk Encryption can even hide the encrypted and password protected volumes in media container files (e.g. MP3, AVI) for enhanced security. Encryption: Good or bad, the debate continues A weeks-long showdown between the FBI and Apple ended last month without a clear winner, but the debate rages on over government access to encrypted data in an era of evolving mobile technology. 4. LaCie Private-Public LaCie Private-Public comes from LaCie, a French manufacturer of storage devices owned by Seagate. It's a straightforward utility that makes quick work of encrypting flash drives. The working of the program doesn't involve too much. Just specify the space on the flash drive that you'd like to password protect, and LaCie Private-Public will encrypt it using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. The utility works on both Windows and Mac OS, and is available as a portable application. 5. Bitlocker To Go BitLocker To Go is perfect if you don't want to go for a third-party solution for password protecting USB flash drives. It's an encryption feature that's built into all modern versions of Windows. It can be easily configured via the 'BitLocker Drive Encryption' option in the Windows Control Panel. Flash drives are encrypted using AES-256 algorithm. The encryption is further locked by a user specified password. Even if you forget the password, the same can be recovered through an automatically generated recovery key that can be saved to a file.</text>

	<text>BERLIN: German police said on Saturday they found a pig's head bearing an "insulting inscription" outside Chancellor Angela Merkel's constituency office in the country's northeast. A police patrol discovered the animal's head outside the office in the Baltic sea town of Stralsund in the early hours of Saturday. A spokesman for regional police refused to be drawn on the nature of the insults, saying only that they were directed at Merkel, who was first elected to parliament in Stralsund 26 years ago. The conservative chancellor has been criticised by many Germans over her welcoming stance towards the migrants that have poured into Europe over the past year. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been buoyed by concerns over the integration of the more than one million asylum-seekers that arrived in Germany in 2015, becoming the country's third-biggest party. Merkel's migrant policies have also been contested by some members of her own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as well as its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).</text>

	<text>PARIS: France will create centres in each region of the country to de-radicalize people or prevent them from being involved in jihadist groups, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Monday, as he laid out new anti-terror measures. "The fight against jihadism is without doubt the big challenge of our generation," he said, flanked by the interior and justice ministers. The plan, which will cost an additional $US 45.5 million by 2018 on top of the current funding, aims to double existing efforts to try to help people already in jihadist networks or those likely to join such groups. Valls said the first de-radicalization centre could be set up by this summer. The measures are a response to the deaths of 147 people in jihadist attacks in France in 2015. Jihadist gunmen stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, satirical newspaper, and a Jewish supermarket in January 2015, killing 17 people, and then 130 people were killed in coordinated attacks on the capital claimed by the Islamic State group last November. Both sets of attacks were carried out mainly by French citizens who had become radicalized and fought abroad alongside jihadist groups. The authorities consider nearly 10,000 people in France to be radicalized and capable of violent actions, according to Le Parisien newspaper.</text>

	<text>PARIS: Two French government ministers and a top legislator stand accused of sexually harassing or abusing women, allegedly grabbing breasts, tweaking thong underwear or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace. Feminist groups are holding a protest on Wednesday to demand an end to widespread sexism in French politics, angry that little has changed five years after Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sex scandals caused uproar. Paris prosecutors are investigating allegations of breast-grabbing and other behavior by Denis Baupin, who resigned as vice president of the lower house of parliament this week. He denies misconduct. A recent report exposed long-buried accusations that territories minister Jean-Michel Baylet repeatedly hit a female aide. Finance minister Michel Sapin was accused in a book of touching a journalist's underwear in 2015. Sapin reportedly has acknowledged an inappropriate gesture.</text>

	<text>PARIS: A French newspaper says France changed its military strategy last year and started airstrikes in Syria because of concerns months before the attacks on Paris that ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud was plotting to target a concert and take hostages. The report in Friday's Le Parisien, citing French and Belgian intelligence material and police recordings, lists repeated occasions when authorities allegedly failed to catch Abaaoud, even though he had been considered a major threat by several European intelligence services before the November 13 attacks. Abaaoud was killed in a police raid five days after the attack by Islamic State suicide bombers. Most of the 130 killed in the attack were hostages in the Bataclan concert hall. The French president's office and interior ministry, which oversee intelligence services, did not respond to requests for comment. Survivors and families of victims on Friday are marking six months since the attacks, which shook the nation and prompted a state of emergency that is still in place. French authorities came under fire immediately after the attacks for intelligence missteps or gaps that failed to prevent the bloodshed. France had been under high alert since deadly shootings at newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher market in January. By September 2015, Le Parisien reported, authorities had identified links between Abaaoud and thwarted attacks on a high-speed train and a church, and suspected he was plotting a big attack. The report quotes a witness as saying Abaaoud asked him to find a concert or other easy target with a lot of people, with the goal of seizing hostages and dying while fighting police. France joined the US-led coalition against IS in Iraq in 2014 but stayed out of Syria. President Francois Hollande changed tack in September 2015, launching Syria airstrikes to prevent what the government said were attack threats. Le Parisien said the decision was prompted by intelligence about Abaaoud, and that a September 27 French airstrike on Deir ez-Zor in Syria was aimed at Abaaoud's training camp.</text>

	<text>PARIS: A 19-year-old French teenager committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a suburban train in Paris and streamed the act live on Periscope, a judicial source said on Wednesday. The unnamed woman "spoke of a rape and named the aggressor" during the filming, the judicial source said, adding that the claims were being treated with caution at this stage. The actual death, which took place at a station in Egly to the south of Paris, was removed by Periscope but some of the video leading up to the suicide was still available on YouTube. At one point the victim is seen on a couch, saying the video is "not designed to create a buzz... but to make people react, to open their minds, and nothing else". The video then cuts to a black screen, and what appear to be the voices of emergency personnel can be faintly heard. Many messages of concern from Periscope users are seen flashing up on the screen. Periscope is a smartphone application that allows users to stream live video via their Twitter account. The video remains accessible for 24 hours. An investigation has been opened into the circumstances of the suicide. "Analysis of the telephone and recovery of the video are ongoing," said the source. Police said they were informed by someone watching the Periscope stream. "We were alerted around 4:30 pm by a Periscope user who was connected with the victim and told us that she was not well," a police source said. The victim also sent a text message to a friend just before committing suicide. Twitter, which bought Periscope in 2015, said it did not comment on individual accounts.</text>

	<text>BRUSSELS: EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstroem said on Friday a historic free trade deal between Europe and the United States could still be reached in 2016 despite growing opposition. "We are working as hard as we can to do this," Malmstroem, the EU's trade commissioner, said, arriving for talks with ministers from the European Union's 28 member countries to discuss the deal. "But only if we feel that it is a good agreement that respects our red lines of course... and that we feel comfortable that member states will endorse it," she added. As she spoke, about 100 activists protested outside the Brussels venue of the ministerial talks, demanding that the negotiations be abandoned. Washington and Brussels want the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) completed in 2016 before US President Barack Obama leaves office, but it has faced mounting opposition especially in France and Germany. Polls show that Germans are growing increasingly wary of the proposed pact despite Chancellor Angela Merkel's continued support. In France, President Francois Hollande said earlier in May that Paris would reject it "at this stage". A poll said nearly two-thirds of French people don't trust the government to defend the country's interests in the negotiations. TTIP aims to topple regulatory and tariff barriers to trade and investment.</text>

	<text>MUNICH: A man killed one person and wounded three others in a knife attack at a German railway station on Tuesday that prosecutors said had "an apparent Islamist motive." Police said the man had slashed four people around 5am (0300 GMT) at the station in the town of Grafing east of Munich. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office later said one man had died from wounds suffered in the attack. He said the 27-year-old "assailant made remarks at the scene of the crime that indicate a political motive -- apparently an Islamist motive," said the spokesman. "We are still determining what the exact remarks were." Local media reported that witnesses had said the young man had yelled "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest") during the attack. The police spokesman said "a political background cannot be ruled out," adding that the man arrested was "not very cooperative". Last August, two German-speaking jihadists claiming to belong to the Islamic State jihadist group threatened Germany with attacks in an online execution video, urging their "brothers and sisters" in Germany and Austria to commit attacks against "unbelievers" at home.</text>

	<text>BERLIN: The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency has warned that Russia is being increasingly aggressive in its cyber war activities. The BfV agency said on Friday that Russian intelligence agencies appear to be behind a year-long campaign of electronic espionage known as the "Sofacy/ATP 28" campaign, whose targets have included the German Parliament. It identified another campaign, codenamed "Sandworm," that it said appeared to be aimed at sabotaging universities, telecoms firms and energy companies. BfV chief Hans-Georg Maassen said most campaigns were designed to obtain information, but that "Russian intelligence agencies are also showing a readiness to (carry out) sabotage."</text>

	<text>ISTANBUL: Turkey has killed 3,000 Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday, adding that no other country is fighting Islamic State as Ankara is. NATO member Turkey was initially a reluctant partner in the US-led coalition against Islamic State and faced criticism in the earlier stages of the Syrian war for failing to stop foreign fighters crossing its borders and joining the radical group. Turkey has meanwhile said it needs more help from Western allies in the fight against Islamic State, particularly near the Syrian border, where the Turkish town of Kilis has been hit for weeks by repeated rocket fire.</text>

	<text>VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis on Thursday hinted that he is now open to the idea of women serving as deacons in the Catholic Church. In a restricted meeting conducted with some 900 superiors of women's religious orders, the pope agreed to a proposal to create an official commission to study whether women can be deacons. Deacons are ordained ministers but are not priests, though they can perform many of the same functions as priests like preside over weddings, baptisms and funerals, and preach. They however cannot celebrate Mass. Currently; married men, who are also mostly barred from the Roman Catholic priesthood, can serve as deacons. While women cannot serve as deacons, many historians claim that women served as deacons in the early Church. Despite this new development, the pope in no way signalled during a conversation with the sisters that the church's long-standing prohibition on ordaining women priests will change. But asked during a question-and-answer session if he would be willing to create a commission to study whether women could serve as deacons, Francis said he was open to the idea, according to the National Catholic Reporter and Catholic News Service, which had reporters in the audience.</text>

	<text>ROME: Italian police on Tuesday arrested an Afghan suspected of plotting attacks in Italy, Britain and France after finding incriminating evidence on his mobile phone. A second Afghan has been arrested for alleged people trafficking while warrants have been issued for three other people, two Afghans and a Pakistani man, police said. The investigation began in December after four Afghans were spotted taking videos inside a shopping centre in Bari in southern Italy, and a police search of their phones uncovered other images of the city's airport and port, as well as sites in Rome, Paris and London. "It was clear these were not tourist images. They appear to have been scouting sensitive sites," prosecutor Roberto Rossi said at a news conference in Bari. The phones also contained images of Italian and Afghan military vehicles and weapons, as well as Taliban propaganda videos and "a series of chants traditionally sung in preparation for martyrdom", he said. One of the defendants was also seen in a photograph posing with an MS16 semi-automatic rifle, which Rossi said was "not an easy weapon to find on the market". He also had links on his smartphone to websites "only accessible to those with connections to the international jihadist network". The suspects had been taking expensive trips around Europe, which they had paid for in cash, Rossi said. Investigators also uncovered details of trafficking prices and routes of migrants into Italy, but also through Hungary or Calais. But they were unable to pull information from one of the phones recovered: a locked iPhone. The two men arrested had each been awarded a humanitarian residence permit in Italy  one in 2011 and one last week  and the latter was still living at a reception centre for asylum seekers when he was detained. Interior minister Angelino Alfano hailed the "success of a high-level inquiry" and said the case showed no country was "zero risk". Police said the investigation would continue, with Rossi suggesting it was "likely" the wanted men had returned to Afghanistan and Pakistan, but could also be in other European countries.</text>

	<text>MOSCOW: Russia on Monday staged a grandiose military parade through Moscow's Red Square as part of nationwide celebrations to mark 71 years since the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Some 10,000 troops, tanks and nuclear missile systems swept across Red Square's cobblestones in front of President Vladimir Putin, senior officials, and a handful of war veterans. Putin addressed the troops, congratulating them on a holiday that traditionally unites Russians across political divides. The Kremlin strongman also took the opportunity to call for the international community to unite in the fight against global terrorism. "We must overcome this evil, and Russia is open to uniting forces with other states, it is ready to work on the creation of a modern, non-aligned international security system," Putin said. The parade on Red Square also saw military aircraft, including Su-35 fighter jets Russia uses in its bombing campaign in war-torn Syria, swoop over Moscow in a resounding fly-by.

After the parade on Red Square thousands of Muscovites marched through the Russian capital clutching flowers and portraits of their relatives who fought in World War II in a Kremlin-backed campaign known as the "Immortal Regiment." Putin led the procession, holding a portrait of his father Vladimir. Russian servicemen march at Red Square (AFP Photo) Police said some 400,000 people took part in the march and that more locals were joining the rally. Several similar marches were held in cities across Russia including Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Vladivostok. May 9 festivities also took place in some former Soviet republics. In Ukraine's war-ravaged east, pro-Russian rebels paraded tanks and heavy weaponry banned under a frail truce. Donetsk, the insurgents' de facto capital, runs along the 30-kilometre-wide buffer zone that is meant to be free of large weapons under a repeatedly-broken peace agreement signed in February 2015. Western leaders in 2015 snubbed invitations to attend Moscow's 70th anniversary celebrations over the Ukraine crisis, leaving Putin to mark the day in the company of the leaders of China, Cuba and other Moscow-friendly figures.

An estimated 27 million of the former Soviet Union's soldiers and civilians were killed in World War II and the Red Army's triumph in the war is viewed as a huge source of pride in Russia.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on Monday published online detailed data from the Panama Papers trove on more than 200,000 secret offshore companies. The searchable database built on just a portion of the documents leaked from the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca reveals more than 360,000 names of individuals and companies behind the anonymous shell firms, the ICIJ said. Reports already published in April based on the explosive dossier linked some of the world's most powerful leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister David Cameron and others to unreported offshore companies. The data forced the resignations of Iceland's prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, and Spain's industry minister Jose Manuel Soria. Until now access to the total cache of 11.5 million documents, originally provided by a mysterious "John Doe", was restricted to the ICIJ and a select group of international media. ICIJ said Monday it is publishing some of the information catalogued in a database "in the public interest," as a global movement against tax evasion and the secrecy accorded the beneficial owners of anonymous shell companies gains force. The database "allows users to explore the networks of companies and people that used -- and sometimes abused -- the secrecy of offshore locales with the help of Mossack Fonseca and other intermediaries," the ICIJ said. But it said it was not making available raw records online, nor was it putting all the information from the records out, in part to prevent access to some personal data and bank account details of those mentioned.

	<text>BERLIN: Germany recorded a steep decline in asylum seeker arrivals in April, official data showed Monday, after the closure of the popular route used by migrants through the Balkans. Some 16,000 migrants arrived in April, down almost a quarter from 20,000 in March, and nearly a 90-percent plunge from December when 120,000 arrivals were recorded. Syrians made up the biggest group of newcomers, with 2,724 applicants in the month. Afghans were the second largest group with 2,063 migrants, followed by Iraqis with 1,853 arrivals. Germany last year took in more than one million refugees and migrants, with the flow accelerating after Chancellor Angela Merkel in September suspended normal EU asylum rules to grant safe haven to people fleeing the Syrian war. The mass influx sparked a backlash in Germany -- which has since reintroduced temporary border controls and taken other steps to reduce numbers -- and in eastern Europe, where a string of Balkan countries in early March shut their borders to refugees flocking in from Greece. The EU has also since agreed on a controversial pact with Turkey to stop refugees crossing by boat to Greece. Under the deal, Turkey has agreed to take back migrants who arrived in Greece after March 20. In return, Europe has pledged that for every Syrian deported, it will accept one refugee from Turkey's vast camps, a move it hopes will discourage people from taking the highly risky journey across the Aegean sea.</text>

	<text>ANKARA: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday denied accusations that Turkish border guards killed and injured asylum seekers trying to find refuge in Turkey. His comments came a day after Human Rights Watch said Turkish border guards were shooting and beating Syrian refugees trying to reach Turkey, resulting in deaths and serious injuries. "We did not shut our doors to those who are coming. We did not use our security forces against them," Erdogan said, in apparent reference to the claims. He said Turkey believed closing doors to people who flee barrel bombs was tantamount to cruelty. "We have opened our doors to them," he added. Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday that Turkish authorities should stop pushing Syrian asylum seekers back at the border, urging Ankara to investigate "all use of excessive force by border guards." Human Rights Watch said that during March and April this year, Turkish border guards used violence against Syrian asylum seekers and smugglers, killing five people, including a child, and seriously injuring 14 others. It added that Syrians living near the border also described the aftermath of the shootings and beatings, including Turkish border guards firing at them as they tried to recover bodies at the border wall. One witness filmed a number of the dead and surviving victims and shared the videos with Human Rights Watch, it added. "We are unable to verify the authenticity of the video purporting to show Turkish border guards targeting refugees," a Turkish official said. The official said Turkey maintains an "open-door" policy but added the open door policy "isn't the same as open borders." "Turkey admits refugees at designated points of entry if and when there is an imminent threat to civilian lives across the border," the official said, adding that otherwise Turkish aid organizations deliver humanitarian aid to those in need inside Syria Turkey is hosting over 2.7 million refugees from the conflict in neighbouring Syria. Only a quarter of a million live in refugee camps, with the rest living in Turkish towns and cities. The government often boasts of the warm welcome extended to Syrians although some critics have suggested the "open door" policy is now at an end with refugees increasingly accommodated on the other side of the border.</text>

	<text>PARIS: France's already unpopular Socialist government faces a no-confidence vote Thursday after it bypassed parliament and forced through a labour reform bill that has led to two months of demonstrations. The government said Tuesday it would resort to the controversial move in the face of fierce opposition from within President Francois Hollande's own party that was set to lead to the bill being defeated in parliament. Opponents need 288 votes to bring down the government, which is considered an unlikely prospect because left-wing rebels and extreme-right lawmakers have said they will refuse to join forces with parties on the right. Its critics say the bill is heavily weighted in favour of employers, but a defiant Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the reform must go ahead "because the country must move forward and because salary negotiations and workers' rights must progress." Unions have called for more demonstrations on Thursday to coincide with the vote of no confidence. The government argues the reform will give companies more flexibility to fight endemic employment, which stands at more than 10 percent -- joblessness has been the defining issue of Hollande's four years in power. But while the right believes the reform fails to go far enough, unions and student groups say it will only serve to erode job security. The right, which has a minority in the National Assembly, or lower house, says Hollande has led the country into an "impasse". Left-wing critics failed by just two votes to bring their own vote of no confidence. Valls remains confident and said he had "no fear" that the government would be brought down. The standoff over the labour reform is just the latest headache for Hollande since he was forced to abandon his attempts at changing the constitution in the wake of the November 13 terror attacks on Paris. In a sign of the government's nervousness on the labour reform issue, it has made a significant U-turn on one of the most controversial measures. Companies which want to lay off staff will not be able to solely use losses in France to justify such a move. Unions fear that companies with profitable international operations will "cook the books" to make it look as if a loss is being made in their French units in order to make redundancies. All of this comes less than a year from the 2017 presidential election. Hollande, facing some of the lowest popularity scores of any left-wing French president, has said he will decide by the end of the year whether to stand for re-election.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: The Indian lobby has been making "untiring efforts" to block the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan by the United States, the Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz has told his country's Senate. Winding up a debate on an adjournment motion moved by Mohsin Khan Leghari and others over the withdrawal of proposed subsidy on sale of F-16s fighter jets to Pakistan by the US, Aziz said the government is pursuing the issue of sale of F-16s with the country at different levels and forums. "The Indian lobby has been making untiring efforts to reverse the US decision, and a strong attempt, through Senator Rand Paul's resolution, to block the sale itself," Aziz was quoted as saying by an official statement. "The move was however defeated proving the strong merit of our arguments, and the effectiveness of our outreach to the US at various levels, particularly to the US Congressional leaders," he said. Congress opposed funding of these eight aircraft through foreign military funding of the United States, he pointed out. Aziz said Pakistan Defence Minister has written a letter to his American counterpart highlighting the importance of F-16s in the war against terror. He said Defence Consultative Group of the two countries would meet at the end of next month where this issue would also be substantially discussed. The Advisor said that Pakistan-US relationship was on positive trajectory during the last three years with significant progress in the realms of political, economic and defence ties.</text>

	<text>BRUSSELS: Belgium will extend its F-16 airstrikes against Islamic State jihadists in Iraq into Syria, the government said Friday, as it grapples with the fallout from deadly IS-claimed bomb attacks in Brussels in March. "In accordance with UN Resolution 2249, the engagement will be limited to those areas of Syria under the control of IS and other terrorist groups," a spokesman for Prime Minister Charles Michel told AFP after a cabinet meeting. More updates on the same are awaited.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani journalist has been brutally shot dead by the relatives of a woman for supporting her in marrying a man of her choice without the family's permission in Punjab province, sparking massive protests. Ajmal Joyia, who was in his 30s, was going home on a motorbike when he was targeted by at least three gunmen in Lodhran district. He was killed on Monday while his cousin, who was also riding on the same motorbike, was critically injured, police said. "Joyia was targeted by the relatives of a woman who married a man of her choice without the permission of the family," a police official said. He had reportedly extended his support to the beleaguered couple and was said to have approached district authorities to provide the couple with adequate security, reports said. Police have arrested one of the killers while two others were still at large. Journalists in various cities of Punjab organised protests against the killing and demanded arrest of the killers and financial compensation for Joyia's family. Honour killings are common in Pakistan and women defying family for love or marriage are often killed. Sometimes those supporting such couple are also targeted. Last month, a teenaged girl was killed and her body was burnt in Abbotabad district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province for allegedly helping her friend run away with a boy and marry him.</text>

	<text>LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan has admitted that he formed an offshore company to buy the London flat in 1983 to evade British taxes. According to Dawn, when speaking to reporters at London Heathrow Airport, Imran said that he formed the offshore firm on the advice of his accountant to evade taxes during his playing days to buy a flat in London. "I was already paying 35 per cent tax on my income there, so to evade further taxes, I bought the flat through an offshore firm, which was my right as I was not a British citizen," Imran told the reporters. Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Naeemul Haq also admitted that Khan had formed a 'legal' offshore company through his earnings from cricket. "I was Imran Khan's bank manager in London at that time, his accountants formed this company to buy the London flat," said the PTI spokesman. He added that when the flat was sold, Imran brought the money to Pakistan through Habib Bank. Imran Khan had severely criticised Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family for owning and benefiting from offshore companies after the ICIJ investigation which led to the release of Panama papers revealing offshore accounts of the rich and mighty across the world. He, along with other opposition leaders, demanded the prime minister to resign until the issue is investigated and the premier gets a clean chit.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Underlining that Pakistan's "double game" has long frustrated US officials, a leading American daily today said the country remains a "duplicitous and dangerous" partner for the US and it was time to "put the squeeze" on it. "Pakistan's double game has long frustrated American officials, and it has grown worse. There are now efforts in Washington to exert more pressure on the Pakistan Army," The New York Times said in a lead editorial today. In the editorial 'Time to Put the Squeeze on Pakistan', the New York Times Editorial Board said nearly 15 years after 9/11, the war in Afghanistan is raging and Pakistan "deserves much of the blame". "It remains a duplicitous and dangerous partner for the United States and Afghanistan, despite USD 33 billion in American aid and repeated attempts to reset relations on a more constructive course," the editorial board wrote, questioning the Pakistan policy of the Obama administration. Of the view that the key to talks with the Taliban and bringing peace in Afghanistan lies with Pakistan, The New York Times said Pakistan's powerful army and intelligence services have for years given support to the Taliban and the Haqqani terrorist network and relied on them to protect Pakistani interests in Afghanistan and prevent India from increasing its influence there. "Under American pressure, the Pakistan Army recently waged a military campaign against the Taliban in the ungoverned border region. But the Haqqanis still operate in relative safety in Pakistan. Some experts say the army has helped engineer the integration of the Haqqanis into the Taliban leadership," the daily said. The New York Times praised Senator Bob Corker, Chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for putting a hold on the sale of eight F-16s to Pakistan with American tax payers money. "Mr Corker told The Times he would lift the hold on the aid if Pakistan cracks down on the Haqqani network, which he called the 'No. 1 threat' to Afghanistan and American troops there," the daily said. However, the daily was of the view that serving ties with Pakistan is not an option given the fast expanding nuclear weapons arsenal of this South Asian country. The New York Times said the "grim reality presents difficult choices for Mr Obama, who must decide whether to keep the current troop strength and possibly to change the military's role to fight the Taliban more directly."</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: China and Pakistan are closely coordinating moves to block India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). Beijing is using Pakistan's non-starter position with the NSG to block India's application in the name of parity, stating that it would either support NSG entry for both India and Pakistan, or none of them. Talking about the China - Pakistan grand strategy to stall India's admission into the NSG , well placed US sources who work with the NSG said that from all counts it does appear that China and Pakistan are coordinating closely to stop the Indian entry. The sources pointed to the fact that when India sought an information session with the NSG Participating Governments (PGs) at the recent NSG Consultative Group meeting on April 25 and 26, where it would have made a formal presentation to the NSG Group in support of its membership, Pakistan requested for a similar discussion slot with the NSG PGs. Sources said that even though Pakistan was fully aware that its request would be rejected, it made its application at the cue of China, in order for Beijing to look even-handed when it sought the rejection of both requests on grounds of parity. Providing an insight into the China-Pakistan plan to stall India, sources say that Pakistan is now going to write to all the NSG PGs about its wish to join the group. This is being done in anticipation of an application by India for NSG membership at the forthcoming plenary session of the group in June. The Pakistani application, added sources, is "just a decoy" for China to reject both applications on grounds of parity. China knows that Pakistan does not stand a chance at the NSG, and most of the states will reject Islamabad's application. By taking the lead in rejecting the Pakistani application along with that of India, China would like to project its position as "neutral" when in reality it is "working in tandem with Pakistan to stall India's application ". US sources are disappointed with the Chinese tactics of "using Pakistan's non credentials with the NSG to settle scores with India". Informed sources say that this strategy is not a secret and during Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain's visit to China in November 2015, China revealed its hand when it told President Hussain that if India is allowed to get NSG membership, China would ensure that Pakistan also joins the group. The Chinese government told President Hussain that "if India is allowed to join the NSG and Pakistan is deprived of NSG membership, Beijing will veto the move and block the Indian entry". Sources maintain that true to its word, China is following a plan that will enable it to use Pakistan's non-acceptance at the NSG to block India's acceptance. "It is both or none" is the Chinese plan to derail the Indian application, say sources. Chinese officials at the NSG level have been using the Pakistan card to stop India's entry into it while appearing to be even handed in China's relations with India. Well informed sources also point to comments made by Pakistan's former permanent representative to the United Nations Zamir Akram who virtually admitted the grand China - Pakistan plan to stall India's entry into the NSG when, he said, that India will not make it to the NSG despite US support since China was committed to both India and Pakistan joining the NSG at the same time, and would block any move for a unilateral admission of India. He added that chances of India gaining entry into the NSG are virtually nil. The former senior Pakistani official also made it known that Islamabad has "friends at the NSG" who won't let India enter the group. US sources have seen through China's game of "either both or none" in the NSG. They say that India's non-proliferation credentials can never be compared with Pakistan's, as Pakistan has a history of "selling Nuclear technology to rogue states like Libya". They point to the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, Dr A.Q. Khan, and his global nuclear trade. Added to this history, is the fear in the West that Pakistan's nuclear weapons, especially the tactical version that it is now in the process of developing, can easily find their way into the hands of terrorists, as Pakistan's nuclear command is extremely vulnerable to penetration by Islamic hardliners. Well-placed sources say that China is aware of this situation, and is mindful of the fact that Pakistan can never be considered for membership in any global nuclear club, but that won't stop China from using Pakistan as a "parity token to stop India which is fast emerging as China's competitor at a global level". By rejecting the applications of both Pakistan and India, China is telling New Delhi and the NSG governments that it is "neutral", when in fact it is working with Pakistan to reject India's application in the hope that there won't be an Indian reaction. US sources say China's grand plan is to "eat its cake and have it too", that is reject the Indian application to the NSG on the pretext of "neutrality" between India and Pakistan and then hope that the "neutrality" card will stop any Indian commercial blowback on China. Giving further insight into the plan, US sources say that China "would be naive to expect that there won't be an Indian reaction, and especially a commercial one, as China is mindful that India is fully qualified to join the NSG, and by playing the 'Pakistan parity card', China is only hurting its own interests with an upcoming economic power, India."</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The US is committed to maintaining its "important" and "vital" relationship with Pakistan, the Obama Administration said amid reports of strains in bilateral ties. "It is an important, vital relationship that we strongly believe in. Is it complicated at times? Absolutely it is. And do we see eye-to-eye on every issue with Pakistan? No, we don't," state department spokesman, John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference. "But that's why the relationship matters so much because we have shared threats and shared concerns, shared interests in the region. And we're going to continue to work at it," he said. Kirby was responding to a question on the statement made by Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz that his country's relationship with the United States has been under stress for the past three months. Kirby said he has not seen the statement. "I didn't see his comments. So I'm going to refrain from responding specifically to that sentiment," he said. Kirby did not agree when asked if the US-Pakistan ties are not at the best of times these days. "It is an important relationship that we continue to work at very, very seriously. We're going to remain committed to. And I would not share that characterization of it," Kirby said.</text>

	<text>LAHORE: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz said that relations with the United States have been under stress for the past three months because of conditions attached by Washington to the funding of F-16s' sale. According to Dawn newspaper, the adviser admitted this while winding up a debate in the Senate on an adjournment motion on the US decision to withdraw proposed subsidy on the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan. Aziz said that Pakistan-US relations had come to a standstill in 2011 because of incidents of WikiLeaks, Raymond Davis, Abbottabad operation, Datta Khel and Salala. Since 2013, he said Pakistan's relations with the US had witnessed an "upward trajectory". "In the past three months, however, this upward trajectory in relations has witnessed a downward slide, as reflected in a decision of the US Congress to block partial funding for eight F-16 aircraft," he said. Aziz said that the action by the US might have been caused by concerns raised by Washington on the nuclear issue which had been firmly rejected by Pakistan. "We have also rejected frequent demands, especially by the US Congress, for the release of Dr Shakil Afridi. The US officials, Congress, think-tanks and media, in tandem with our adversaries, have also been blaming Pakistan for supporting the Haqqani network without giving any concrete evidence to enable us to take additional action against it or other terrorist organisations," he added. Asserting that the Haqqani Network issue remained the top US concern at the moment, Aziz said that Indian lobby in the US had not been cooperative especially after the Pathankot incident. However, he assured the Senate that in view of the importance of the issue, Pakistan had been making all-out efforts to finalise the F-16 deal with the US administration. (ANI)</text>

	<text>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has criticised the demand made by India along with other G4 countries of adding more permanent seats to the UN Security Council, saying it was based on "poor logic" and reflected the "self-serving national ambition" of a few. Pakistan's envoy to the UN Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi, at the informal meeting of the General Assembly on Inter- Governmental Negotiations on Security Council reform, said the objective of the Council's expansion should be to respond to the concerns and "aspirations of all, not just a few." A statement issued by the Pakistan mission here claimed that Lodhi last week "exposed" the G-4 position on Security Council expansion. India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, speaking on behalf of the G4 nations -- Brazil, Germany, India and Japan -- had said at the meeting that the problem of "imbalance of influence" in the Council cannot be corrected if only non-permanent members are added to the powerful UN body. The statement by the Pakistan mission said Lodhi "exposed the poor logic of India and its allies" by saying that the G4 formula of adding more permanent seats "reflected the self-serving national ambition of a few at the expense of the world body's wider membership." "To propose allocation of 4-6 seats permanently to that many countries, while handing over only 4-5 seats to the rest of the membership is not only poor mathematics but also poor logic and even poorer rationale for a just and meaningful reform," Lodhi was quoted as saying by the statement. India had said at the meeting that the problem lies in the "imbalance of influence" within the Security Council between the permanent and non-permanent members and expanding members only in the non-permanent category is not going to solve the problem. Opposing the proposal that sought expansion in permanent membership, Lodhi argued that this runs contrary to the principles that all member states agree on -- to make the Council "more representative, democratic, accountable, transparent and effective". She stressed that only additional electable seats, on the basis of periodic elections and fixed rotation, would allow equal, fair and increased opportunity to all states to aspire for Security Council's membership.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: A joint raid by US and Afghan forces on Tuesday rescued the son of a former Pakistani prime minister from a three-year-long Taliban captivity in Afghanistan, Pakistan's foreign ministry said. The Afghan National Security Adviser Mohammad Hanif Atmar told Pakistan's foreign affairs adviser, Sartaj Aziz, in a telephone call that Ali Haider Gilani was found during the raid in Ghazni province and that arrangements were being made for his transfer to Pakistan, according to the statement from the Pakistani Foreign Office. Gilani, believed to be in his 30s, is the son of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani whose secular anti-Taliban Pakistan People's Party's led several major offensives against Islamic militants. The elder Gilani, who served as prime minister from 2008 to 2012, said last year that the kidnappers demanded the release of several al-Qaida prisoners in exchange for his son. He also said that the captors had let his son talk to him by phone for eight minutes, and that he was being held somewhere in Afghanistan. Gunmen kidnapped the younger Gilani in May 2013, several days before the general elections in his central Pakistani hometown of Multan. There was no immediate comment from US or Afghan officials. Abdul Qadi Gilani, a brother of the younger Gilani, praised Afghan authorities and Pakistan's army chief Gen. Raheel Sharif for his brother's successful recovery. He said the army chief also called their father about the rescue. A jubilant elder Gilani was seen on Pakistani TV attending an election rally after hearing the news. "This is a very good day for me," the father said as his other son, Abdul Qadir, told reporters in Multan that his brother will arrive from Afghanistan to Islamabad later Tuesday. "I am very happy and I have no words to express my joy," Abdul Qadir said. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif issued a statement expressing pleasure over the rescue while the current leader of the People's Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, announced on Twitter the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad first called the elder Gilani to tell him about his son. The Pakistani Taliban have fought the state for over a decade, killing tens of thousands of people in a bid to install their own harsh Islamic system.</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is poised to get $510 million from the IMF as part of a three-year, $6.7 billion assistance programme, the bank said on Thursday while forecasting a real GDP growth of 4.7 per cent for the cash-strapped country in 2016-17. The International Monetary Fund reviewed Pakistan's economic performance before saying that $510 million will be available under a three-year, $6.7 billion financial assistance programme. The agreement was reached after the IMF mission held discussions with Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Ashraf Wathra and other senior officials in Dubai from May 2 to May 11. Dawn reported that the money will be provided when the review is approved by the IMF's management and executive board. "After productive discussions, the mission and the Pakistani authorities have reached staff-level agreement on the completion of the eleventh review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement," said Harald Finger, the Fund's mission chief for Pakistan in a statement issued in Dubai. The statement added that growth has remained robust despite a weak cotton harvest and declining exports amid a more challenging global environment. "Real GDP growth is expected to reach 4.5 per cent in FY 2015-16 and 4.7 per cent in FY 2016-17, helped by favourable oil prices, rising investment, including related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), improvements in energy supply, buoyant construction activity, and acceleration of credit growth." IMF stated that all end-March 2016 quantitative performance criteria, including the budget deficit target and the floor on the SBP's net international reserves, have been met. Pakistan's gross domestic product growth is projected at 4.5 per cent in the 2015/16 fiscal year and 4.7 per cent in the following year, the IMF said.</text>

	<text>In an exclusive interview to TOI, former Pakistan envoy to the US Husain Haqqani weighs in on the neighbours' fractured ties and the vexed Kashmir question consistent engagement or sustained isolation are the only two options between India and Pakistan, says Husain Haqqani, former Pakistan envoy to the US and Sri Lanka."These on-again-off-again talks do not yield results, nor do threats that are not carried out. That's our history," adds Haqqani, a leading South Asia expert and academic as well as a key aide to former Pakistan president Asif Zardari. In an exclusive conversation with TOI, Haqqani says the space for "friendship" between India and Pakistan is shrinking. In his forthcoming book India vs Pakistan: Why Can't We Just Be Friends?, Haqqani says, "...Much of the Pakistani handling of the state (J&amp;K) has been unstrategic, overwrought and unsophisticated -both in the past and in the present. While India hasn't always behaved well, especially in its brutal militarisation of the state and frequent human rights violations, it is Pakistan that has erred in adopting a zero-sum approach on Kashmir." Haqqani says a treasure he found while working on the book was an exchange of letters between former US secretary of state James Baker and Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif from 1992. "To think that, 24 years ago, Pakistan was saying similar things to what it is saying now on terrorism, and the international community, led by America, was saying exactly what they are saying now... It shows that for a quarter of a century there has been absolute consistency in Pakistan's conduct as well as its excuses." The message remains the same; the Pakistani excuses too remain the same; only the groups have changed. Then, it was Harkat-ul-Ansar; now, it's Lashkare-Taiba and the Haqqani Network. Having dug out hitherto untold nuggets of India-Pakistan's tortuous history, Haqqani says, "Does any Indian or Pakistani know that in 1959 Ayub Khan had said that plebiscite would never happen? Yet, Pakistan's public policy remains `plebiscite or nothing' on Kashmir." In his book, he writes, "Before Ayub's coup in October 1958, for example, Prime Minister Firoz Khan Noon had spoken of `the folly of war' with India, only to be ridiculed by the Muslim League and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami who called for use of force to settle India-Pakistan issues." The different national priorities of India and Pakistan after Independence were starkly revealed when Nehru first visited Washington in 1949, Haqqani says. The then US president Harry Truman asked Nehru how he could help India. Nehru asked for help to set up IITs and modernise agriculture. When the then Pakistan PM Liaquat Ali Khan made the same trip a few months later, in response to the same question, he produced a list of military equipment."We are living with the consequences of that choice today," he adds. It has also been very difficult for any Pakistani leader to survive for long after negotiating a peace deal with India. Haqqani lists the casualties -"In 1958, Feroz Khan Noon, PM of Pakistan, went to India. He came back saying hostility forever is not an option. We need a no-war pact, and to normalise relations. He is deposed and martial law imposed. Then, Ayub Khan is in power. He goes to war, but the 1965 war does not play out as expected. The Tashkent declaration is followed by marches on the streets by Islamists. Ayub Khan is out of power and we have a new general, Yahya Khan. Then we go to war again in 1971, and after that (Zulfikar Ali) Bhutto signs the Simla Accord. But by 1977, Bhutto is gone. Each time we have some progress, we go back to square one, with a change in government in Pakistan." In his book, Haqqani writes that, after 2008, when a civilian government took charge in Islamabad, they could find no record of the backchannel negotiations on Kashmir that had happened between S K Lambah and Tariq Aziz for three years, where both sides came close to a real understanding of a solution. "I'm sure the record existed, but the Pakistan military leaders did not want to share it with the civilians, and they actually wanted the negotiating process to go back to square one. After all, Gen Musharraf was both COAS and president. So, disciplined military officers who did not want normalisation with India could not say anything. Once a civilian government came in, those in the Pakistan intelligence services and Pakistan military who felt Musharraf may have given away too much, thought this was a golden opportunity to take the conversation back."</text>

	<text>LAHORE: Three young women in one family were shot dead by male relatives who suspected them of having "illicit relations" with other men, police in eastern Pakistan said Wednesday. The women, aged 22, 28 and 29, all lived in the same house in the city of Faisalabad. "The men suspected that the three women had illicit relations with other men and shot them in the chest and face and fled after the murders," police investigator Mohammad Ayub told AFP. Police have launched a manhunt, he said, added that it appeared to a case of "honour killings". Officials at the local police station confirmed the account. Last week a teenage girl in the country's northwest was strangled and her body set ablaze after a village council ruled she must die for helping a friend to elope, sparking anger from rights activists. Hundreds of women are murdered by their relatives in Pakistan each year on the pretext of defending family "honour". Pakistan amended its criminal code in 2005 to prevent men who kill female relatives escaping punishment by pardoning themselves as an "heir" of the victim. But it is left to a judge's discretion to decide whether to impose a prison sentence when other relatives of the victim forgive the killer - a loophole which critics say is still exploited. "A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness" - a film telling the story of a rare survivor of an attempted honour killing - won the Academy Award for best documentary short in February. Publicity surrounding the film prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to vow to eradicate the "evil" of honour killings, but no fresh legislation has been tabled since then.</text>

	<text>BRUSSELS: Brussels Capital Region lawmaker Dr Manzoor Zahoor Ellahi has signed a petition extending his support in creating awareness regarding the proposed annexation of Gilgit Baltistan and the construction of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Ellahi, a lawmaker of Pakistani origin and a member of the Socialist Party of Belgium (Parti Socialiste), also happens to be the doctor of Pakistani embassy in Brussels. He signed the petition along with Motaher Chowdhury, the local councilor for Ixelles-Brussels. The Europe-wide signature campaign is being organized by Junaid Qureshi, a Kashmiri writer, international human rights activist and a senior leader of the Jammu Kashmir Democratic Liberation Party (JKDLP). In Brussels, the Signature Campaign was held on May 7 and 8. The organizer for Overseas Affairs of United Kashmir People's National Party (UKPNP) based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Dr Ishaq Khan, also visited the venue of the signature campaign to sign the petition and expressed his support. "We stand against all designs which divide our motherland further and we will not allow anyone to loot our resources. We stand against the division of Jammu and Kashmir, the proposed annexation of Gilgit Baltistan by Pakistan and the construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor which is being built without any say or consent from the people of Gilgit Baltistan," he said. Meanwhile, Qureshi expressed his satisfaction regarding the progress of the Signature Campaign. "Hundreds of signatures were already collected in the first leg of the signature campaign in The Netherlands. Brussels, being the unofficial capital of Europe, seat of the European Parliament and home to other European institutions, proved to be a very successful city for our campaign," he said. He hoped to gather the same positive response from the public in Vienna, Geneva, Paris and various cities of UK. Talking about the campaign, he said, "More than three thousand pamphlets and flyers were distributed to the public and more than 500 signatures were collected in just two days. I am also very humbled by the visit and support of MP Manzoor Zahoor Ellahi and Councilor Motaher Chowdhury. It clearly shows that human rights issues stand above party politics or other sentimental alliances". Expressing his delight over Ellahi's support, Qureshi said, "It is very encouraging to see that a Pakistani MP is supporting our efforts against the annexation of Gilgit Baltistan and the construction of CPEC. This should serve as a wake-up call to the Pakistani establishment and all other supporters of Pakistan's duplicitous policy on Jammu and Kashmir."</text>

	<text>ISLAMABAD: Over 250 Pakistanis, including senior officials and the mother of a woman filmmaker who won two Oscars this year, have been listed in the biggest-ever global data leaks as having offshore companies. According to the details given by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) through an online searchable database, at least 259 Pakistanis have been named with links to offshore companies. They include several influential people including Abdul Sattar Dero, former general manager of the Port Qasim Authority; Shaukat Ahmed, the ex-president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI); and Saba Obaid, mother of renowned filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. The Dawn reported that the database contains ownership information about companies created in 10 offshore jurisdictions including the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands and Singapore. It covers nearly 30 years until 2010. The fresh digital cache includes names of members of Pakistan's business elite but it is not immediately ascertainable whether the documents contain names of political heavyweights like the explosive April 3 Panama leaks that named Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's children Maryam, Hassan and Hussain among other world leaders having offshore wealth. The release of more names with link to offshore companies may soften pressure on Sharif, who faced angry opposition demanding his resignation over the Panama scandal. Sharif last month asked Supreme Court to probe all listed in the Panama papers, while opposition parties want his probe first. When asked to comment, filmmaker Obaid-Chinoy told the Dawn: "I fully support ICIJ and the laudable efforts being made by it. I would, however, like to clarify that my name is not mentioned in the Panama leaks and I am neither the legal nor the beneficial owner of any enterprise mentioned in the Panama Papers. "There is a mention of my mother, Mrs.Saba Obaid and I say with confidence that the off-shore companies mentioned in the Panama Papers as being owned by my mother are compliant with the applicable laws."</text>

	<text>Low-performers usually look for a boss who will treat every employee equally. A boss who doesn't know who is doing what, where, why, when or how, a boss who doesn't keep track and ignores performance problems . A boss who doesn't tell them what to do and how to do it and who doesn't spell out expectations but leaves them to their own devices. These employees collect their pay packets just as everyone else, regardless of their mediocre performance . In other words, they are the beneficiaries of undermanagement. And therein lies the importance of appraisals . They help to strategically review the strength, weaknesses and achievements of workers during the year, says Bruce Tulhan, author of "It's okay to Manage Your Boss". The title is catchy, it's specific, detailed and honest. Tulhan's warning that becoming a better manager is like starting a fitness programme couldn't have been more apt. The book advises you on how to engage your boss in your work, get clear directions from him and guides employees with tools and feedback for success. But he also says clearly that the book is meant for high-performers. He says that one needs to create a close, official relationship with every boss, no matter how great or awful he is, no matter how he is on any given day or how he himself performs. Tulhan charts out four basic things an employee must take responsibility for. They are: Clearly spelled-out and reasonable expectations with a concrete timetable; skills, tools and resources necessary to meet those expectations; accurate feedback about your performance as well as coursecorrecting direction and fair quid pro quo, ie, recognition and rewards in exchange for performance. There are also tips for keeping a close, official relationship with your coworkers. Tulhan is also able to shift the wheat from the chaff and says that though managers are demanding more and more from employees, they are also providing them with less guidance than ever before. But employees can improve their careers despite this lacunae. He debunks certain myths such as if you are a high-performer , then your boss shouldn't tell you how to do your work. This book is especially relevant in today's times when companies are cutting back on overhead expenses and staff as they ride out the financial crisis. Many of today's employees are overworked, often performing the job of two or three people for no additional pay. Research shows that many employees feel powerless and are not in a position to complain about their circumstances, holding on to the job the way one would cling to a lifeboat. It also talks about the epidemic of undermanagement, which is responsible for the precarious environment at the workplace. It is a well-researched book and a successful follow-up to Tulhan's earlier book "It is Okay to be Boss'' . And the bottomline is: It is okay to manage your boss if you are good.</text>

	<text>Pattambi: "Abhivadyangal, abhivadyangal, nooru chuvappan abhivadyangal," this slogan itself was enough for Kanhaiya Kumar to get all fired up and deliver a speech that lasted over half-an-hour at the campaign rally for LDF candidate Mohammed Muhsin, his mate in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and a student activist. Kanhaiya, who looked visibly tired on account of the ongoing hunger strike in JNU, said he did not want to address an election campaign. "However, Muhsin, my dear friend, is contesting in Pattambi. He had been in the forefront of the JNU protests," he said. A massive crowd had thronged the Pattambi market ground to glimpse Kanhaiya, the JNU students' leader. He went straight for the jugular, flaying Prime Minister Narendra Modi for "comparing Kerala with Somalia". "The PM should learn history and check facts before insulting a most developed and educationally-advanced state like Kerala," he said. Youths were seen quickly translating the speech to Malayalam to those sitting nearby. Each sentence uttered by Kanhaiya was welcomed with thunderous applause. Kumar said Kerala is fortunate that the election battle is between the LDF and UDF. He also welcomed the Delhi high court order staying disciplinary action initiated against him, Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya and others. As the speech ended, the 'Azadi' chants that had beguiled youth at JNU campus reverberated across the venue.</text>

	<text>It is usually not hard to predict the electoral results of central Kerala belt, which has 23 seats from Kottayam and Thrissur alone. Both districts have a large Christian population traditionally sympathetic towards UDF constituents that include Congress and Kerala Congress. But this time it may not be that easy, even for stalwarts like K M Mani who is contesting from Pala. The BDJS, more than the BJP, is seen as a key force in many constituencies. Kottayam A traditional UDF fort where the LDF has been trying to make inroads, the electoral performance of the NDA is likely to play a crucial role here, especially in constituencies like Poonjar, Ettumanoor, Kanjrappally and Pala. In Poonjar, independent P C George and UDF candidate Georgekutty Augusthy have surged ahead, leaving LDF's P C Joseph behind. In Pala, there is a close contest between KC(M) supremo K M Mani and Mani C Kappen of LDF. Both fronts are troubled by the presence of BJP's N Hari. Ettumanoor looks unpredictable mainly because of the presence of the BDJS candidate A G Thankappan. LDF's Suresh Kurup and UDF candidate Thomas Chazhikadan are exuding confidence, but the latter is troubled by the presence of rebel candidate Josemon Mundackal. Confusion prevails in Kanjirappally, where sitting MLA N Nayaraj of the UDF will have to sweat it out. BJP's V N Manoj had an initial edge in campaign, which has now tapered off. Catholic votes will be decisive in this constituency. It's a neck-and-neck race between the UDF and LDF in Changanassery. The UDF is comfortable in Puthuppally, Kottayam and Kaduthuruthy, while the CPI is hopeful of retaining the Vaikom seat. Idukki Of the five constituencies in Idukki, P J Joseph of the UDF is comfortable in Thodupuzha. The presence of BDJS candidate Biju Madhavan is crucial in Idukki, where a close contest is on between Roshy Augustine of UDF and Francis George of LDF. In Peerumedu, Cyriac Thomas of the UDF is giving a tough fight to current MLA E S Bijimol. M M Mani of the LDF is ahead of Senapathy Venu of the UDF in Udumbanchola. The LDF is also hopeful of retaining the Devikulam seat. Ernakulam Though the district is known as a stronghold of the UDF, almost all constituencies are heading for tight contests this time because of the strong presence registered by the BJP. In Tripunithura, the BJP had secured around 23,500 votes in the segment in the civic polls. Initially, the UDF was expected to have an easy walkover in constituencies like Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Aluva, Kunnathunadu, Paravur, Thrikkakara, Kalamassery, Ernakulam and Kochi, but the situation has become unpredictable now though observers give the UDF a slight edge. In Vypeen, the LDF is considered to be leading. In Angamaly, the UDF seems to have better prospects, though Piravom, where current MLA and minister Anoop Jacob is contesting, may swing to the Left. Thrissur Several constituencies in Thrissur will witness strong triangular contests, because of the strong presence of NDA. The LDF and UDF are claiming that they would win eight to 10 seats, while NDA campaign managers say they are strong in six of the 13 constituencies in the district. The LDF is confident of winning in Kaipamangalam, Nattika, Puthukkad, Guruvayur, Chalakkudy, Chelakkara, Kunnamkulam and Manaloor. Front sources claim that the contest is tough in Kodungallur, Wadakkanchery, Thrissur, Ollur, and Irinjalakkuda. The UDF has high hopes of winning all 10 constituencies except Kaipamangalam, Puthukkad and Nattika.</text>

	<text>It is hard to understand the Indian obsession with new capital cities. Since Independence, five states have chosen to build capitals at unimaginable expense, hardship to farmers and at a colossal waste of material resource, energy and manpower. Nowhere in the world do countries build whole cities from scratch when all that is required is a place to conduct the affairs of government. Countries that were born out of the breakup of Yugoslavia merely moved their capitals to places that had a long history and enough space to accommodate government functions. Zagreb became the capital of Croatia, Sarajevo of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Slovakia, born out of Czechoslovakia in 1993, shifted its capital to the medieval town of Bratislava, while the Czech Republic retained Prague. The 2011 split of Sudan turned the county government of Juba into a national capital for South Sudan, without expense or fuss. If countries can accommodate their capitals within existing cities, why do Indian states insist on constructing new ones? After the division with Telangana, try asking a state like Andhra to adopt a small town or village for its administrative needs, and all hell will break loose. Chandigarh as the first, was understandable. Between Nehru and Le Corbusier, the city was not just a capital for Punjab, but an urban symbol for the new India. That the job was awarded to an artist, was part of the risk Nehru took in the hope that the product would be altogether original, and not conform to tried and tested formulas. Since then, Gandhinagar, and New Bhubaneshwar were drawn in the lazy repeat of Western planning models  endless stretches of forlorn buildings bathed in dust, but conceived on paper as English garden cities. The most recent such experiment at Naya Raipur, the new capital for Chhattisgarh, demonstrates outmoded planning ideas at a monumental scale. Built over 8,000 hectares that displaced over 40 villages, the bloated exercise of state expenditure and land grab  despite newer models of land pools  was a shameful criminal act. Sixty years after Chandigarh, shouldn't state governments be constructing models of thrift that demonstrate altogether new forms of governance? Yesterday Naya Raipur, today Amravati. The Andhra government has staked out its planned territorial intent right at the beginning, proposing secretariats, offices, housing and public structures in the most desirable locations. The undemocratic nature of this first stage of design is in sharp  and ironic  contrast to the entirely democratic and uncontrolled free-for-all when the city eventually opens its gates to migrants. Still, the gigantic effort is not without its problems. Besides agitation by angry farmers, missing land records and a site untested for long-term habitation, the cumbersome procedure that involved chief ministers, bureaucrats and foreign architects has quickly descended into farce. Ideals of planning have had to be realigned to suit ancient beliefs of vaastu; the foreigners were entirely unaware that structures in Andhra could not be approached from the north-east; at the insistence of the chief minister, a 'Kuchipudi' bridge will also be built on the river to reflect Andhra culture; the wholly traditional structure would ironically be designed by a Chinese firm. If the ridiculousness of multiple cultural and technical collaborations makes you laugh, the statistics of expense and logistics will make you cry. Twelve million people are expected to move into a city built on 218 square km of land at an expense of one trillion rupees. Because of the physical atrophy of most cities, their state of utter dereliction and despair, the Indian heart lives in perpetual hope that something new and shining, something wholly un-Indian, may still be possible. So the messages are always filled with stock phrases: sustainable eco-conscious design, green concept, mixed-use neighbourhood, people-friendly technology, solar energy, wind farms, smart-city, world class, iconic... How do you even begin to apply this cascade of borrowed and untested pretensions to vague, unmade places? What would it take to get India's new capitals to downsize? Can in fact state governments reconsider their standard call for elaborate structures  of the kind the Mughals and the British built  to places humbler? Sadly, in the seven states that have been added by subtraction into the Union, none has seen the capital as a potential for new ideas. Without an innovative model of the city, handing over large chunks of disputed land to foreign designers is the ultimate sign of hopelessness and despair. The author is a Delhi-based architect</text>

	<text>Andrea Bocelli has always beaten the odds. Despite going blind at age 12 after an accident at a football match, he has emerged as one of the most famous classical crossover tenors in the world. Making his Indian debut on April 20 in Mumbai with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta, the 57-year-old artiste gives Agniva Banerjee a feel for the music You started off in classical music and then branched into pop. There's even a duet with former Pussycat Doll star Nicole Scherzinger later this year in the UK. What would you say you are, a classical or a pop artiste? I have been trained as an opera singer; opera, I feel, is written in my chromosomes. At the same time, I do not deny pop. There are classical music pieces so beautiful they become popular. And vice versa, there are extraordinary pop songs that over time become classics. How old were you when you started singing? I have always been singing. When I was six or seven, I used to listen to the great voices of the time. I knew many opera arias by heart and I sang loudly in my living room, in a sort of competition with my gramophone. When I was a teenager, having been continually asked to sing by my relatives and friends, I started to think that my greatest passion might also become my profession. Do you also play any instruments? I've always shown a certain facility at playing several instruments  from the saxophone to the horn, the accordion to the drums. Of them all, the piano is my most faithful companion, the one which my inner voice turns to without hesitation. What was it like to study under the great tenor Franco Corelli? My nanny gave me one of his records and that marked my destiny. The first time we met was at a masterclass the maestro gave in Turin in north Italy. I remember my hands were cold and my heart was beating wildly. When it was my turn, I sang 'Che gelida manina' (from Puccini's La boheme). I think I sang in a trance! I know for sure I sweated like an Olympic marathon runner in the glowing atmosphere of the room and that I regained consciousness at the end of the piece, when in the general silence of those present, maestro came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder and in a low voice told me, "Indeed you have a beautiful voice." Did you really work as a lawyer for some time? I decided to study law, perhaps following my parents' insistence, because they wanted me to have a professional future. I have always been fascinated by law, as the study of the rules of civil coexistence. I confirm, I worked as a lawyer before I became famous (as a singer). But I never thought about giving up music. Not even when earning a living did it seem an unrealistic dream. You have reportedly sold 80 million albums. What are your views on success? Success is the sum of a series of variables and of inscrutable balances. Fame in itself is not a value, and I am more than convinced that  as I always remind my children  there are a thousand ways to be people of great value without being famous. As for my success, not a day goes by that I do not think, with wonder and gratitude, of the affection I receive from the vast audience I reach, who grant me the great privilege of being part of the soundtrack of their lives. Unusually for an artiste, you hold a pro-life view on abortion. Can you say why? To give a spark of hope to all those women who, for a thousand reasons, are in a situation where they cannot defend the life they are carrying, I decided years ago to share a private memory of my mother's experience. When she was pregnant, doctors advised her an abortion because the baby would be born with severe birth defects. She ignored such advice and with my father's support carried on with the pregnancy. Without that act of courage and faith, today I would not be here to tell you this. Are you excited about visiting Mumbai? I am extremely excited and curious. I have been to many countries, but this will be my first time in India, a great country that has always fascinated me. I have been conquered by its philosophies, I appreciate its ancient architecture, and I am seduced by its rich musical tradition, by the strong spiritual vibration that can be traced in poetry and art. I have been captured by the coexistence between past and future that India expresses.</text>

	<text>Why are New Yorkers more willing to spend twice as much on French food than Indian? Turns out, their attitudes are not so much swayed by spice, but by popular perceptions of a cuisine's ethnicity and associated class, suggests Krishnendu Ray, the chair of the department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University, in his new book The Ethnic Restaurateur. He tells Joeanna Rebello why we're at the near bottom of New York's food chain From political science at DU, to food and nutrition at NYU...when and how did you detour? I came to the US in 1988 to work on questions of development but was waylaid by nostalgia, which expressed itself through food. I realized that I had to cook Indian food if I were to eat it. Which led to the even starker realization that not only did I not know how to cook, but as a good Indian middle class male, I had never given it a thought. That and the inadvertent running into three books, Laura Shapiro's Perfection Salad, Harvey Levenstein's Revolution at the Table and Jack Goody's Cooking, Cuisine and Class made me realize that I had an opportunity to think seriously about what is good to eat. What was going to be new about my work was that most of the writing on food had been done with attention to cultural roots with relatively little on change and how immigration influences our choices. In your comparative price rankings (of 14 popular cuisines reviewed in the Zagat New York restaurant guides in 1986 and 2014), Indian food has fallen from 8 to 9. What does this demotion tell you? I make the argument that culinary prestige has a lot to do with class, race, and nation. Most Indian restaurants in the US, and in New York City, are run by Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and some Indians who are neither very rich, nor fluently Anglophone, nor highly credentialed, which creates the contamination effect for mainstream, middle-class, Americans. Like Mexican or Chinese food, most Americans refuse to pay more than a pittance for Indian food, which cannot buy the skilled labour, the good ingredients or the decor to create an upscale place. Of say the 350 or so Indian restaurants in NYC, only a dozen are upscale. That was the fate of Italian and Greek food too until immigration from the Mediterranean dried to a trickle and there was upward mobility of third-generation Italians and Greeks. Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Soul... are all stuck at the bottom. That will change when the source of immigration of poor people to America changes. I see that happening to new-style Chinese food such as at Jonathan Wu's Fung Tu. Similarly, better credentialed Indian chefs and entrepreneurs like Floyd Cardoz, Hemant Mathur, Surbhi Sahani, Suvir Saran, Sanjeev Kapoor, Jehangir Mehta, among others, are straining to upscale American notions of Indian food. There is an opening there because more than half of Indian immigrants to the US are entering engineering, management, medicine and the academy. So clever interpretations like the restaurant Babu Ji (in NYC) are playing to those possibilities. Can you give us examples of how the improved social status of a country has made its food more coveted? Americans were full of disdain for Japanese culture, especially food, almost into the 1980s when the rise of Japan and contact with Japanese managers completely transformed American posture towards sushi that American elites had both disdained and were unable to appreciate. Why is haute cuisine such a male-dominated world? On every Western top chefs list, it's still mostly men, who rarely do the everyday cooking at home. That is women's work, poor people's work, which is why the modern world of chefs is so masculine, and so white. That is not a coincidence, but constitutive of the process of professionalization of a field. Women and people of colour will eventually break into the field too but not in my lifetime, I think. Food studies is a growing discipline in America and Europe. Why not in India? There is a long tradition of anthropological studies of the food ways of the poor, the rural, the marginal, and the non-literate. What is new with food studies is the attention to urban, literate, non-poor, at the centre of our systems. Sociologist Amita Baviskar is doing fascinating work in that domain  see her work on Maggi and the Indian working class. There are new PhDs being written in Delhi School of Economics  on sweetmeat makers for instance  that is going to open up that part of the field.</text>

	<text>When it comes to drought, India is not alone. The world's underground water reserves are depleting at an alarming rate. Water scientist Jay Famiglietti suggests that countries sitting on top of the world's most stressed aquifers  Turkey, Syria and Iraq (the Arabian aquifer); India and Pakistan (the Indus and the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin); and Libya and Niger (the Murzuk-Djado Basin)  have had political unrest driven in part by food shortages caused by lack of water. The California-based hydrologist speaks to Namita Devidayal on the big water challenge Your research shows that 21 of the world's 37 largest aquifers, which collectively provide water to more than two billion people, have passed 'sustainability tipping points'. How widespread is the water problem? Most of the world's mid-latitude regions  those that are already arid to semi-arid  are getting drier. Unfortunately, most of the 21 depleting aquifers in our study are located in the drying regions, which means that replenishing groundwater supplies will grow even more difficult in the coming decades. Since groundwater fuels agricultural productivity, its disappearance means that producing food for our growing population will become increasing challenging, sooner rather than later. Several states in India are in the grip of drought, especially Maharashtra. What is your analysis of the situation? Our first major study of groundwater depletion was of northwestern India. Using a NASA satellite called GRACE (the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) we found that the Rajasthan-Punjab-Haryana region was losing about 17.7 cubic kilometers per year. Those are among the highest rates of groundwater depletion in the world. They continue to this day, and the region of loss is now spreading across northern India and into Bangladesh. I'm afraid that this does not bode well for India, now and into the future. On a positive note, since the paper was published in 2009 it has catalyzed new efforts in hydrogeological mapping. At World Water Week in Stockholm in 2013, Alok Rawat from the Ministry of Water Resources of India, told participants that the government had recently added approximately 50,000 groundwater monitoring wells and embarked upon its ambitious national aquifer mapping programme towards sustainable water management. What can we do better to intervene? First, human society must appreciate that in many parts of the world, like southern California where I live, and like you are experiencing in northern India, we simply do not have enough water to do all the things that we want to do. Growing food, producing energy, providing water for people and for the environment, all take a heavy toll. Increased awareness of this critical situation is a first step. Conservation and efficiency are the next critical steps  how we use water to grow food and in the home. Regional governance is not always in tune with the world's current understanding of how water moves over and through the Earth. In many places, like in the US for example, water laws and associated rights are centuries- old and no longer make sense. Admittedly, changes in governance will be most difficult to achieve. What can India learn from other countries? We can learn a great deal about technological innovations from countries like Israel, and about policy innovations from countries like Australia. Israel pioneered drip irrigation, it is committed to advanced monitoring of available waters, and it continues to show the rest of the world how to maximize water use efficiency under the most harsh conditions. Australia has been extremely progressive on the policy front. For example, each of its states has a water minister, and there is a national water minister as well. That considerably streamlines the decision-making process. How close is the relationship between climate change and water? The water cycle and climate are intimately linked. Hence, just as we are seeing changes in climate, we are seeing changes to the water cycle and to the availability of fresh water. Both flooding and drought are becoming more extreme. The wet areas of the world are getting wetter and the dry areas drier. We are already seeing the emergence of classes of water 'haves' and 'have nots' that will only lead to social tension in the future. In fact, changes to Earth's water cycle are among the most palpable aspects of climate change.</text>

	<text>'Sexy chick' roles, pay disparities, discrimination against female directors... sexism runs deep in Hollywood. A non-profit production company, We Do It Together, seeks to change all that with more powerful roles for women both on and off screen. As a member of its advisory board, Freida Pinto is at the Cannes Film Festival to announce its first project. The actor tells Sumeet Keswani about the stereotypes she has encountered and how she fought them At a time when feminism has percolated to the grassroots, how has sexism sustained itself in the upper echelons of Hollywood? Art imitates life. And if you look at the world around, there's a very strong element of sexism ingrained among people, even the most educated groups. I was watching this TED talk on infidelity by Esther Perel and it was very interesting to learn how sexism was actually glorified eons ago. I don't want to sound like a cynic but it would be too high an expectation to think it can disappear suddenly. But it's definitely time to do something about it, to at least curtail the impact of it on women. How will the non-profit address sexism? What's the first project? Although we're a non-profit film production company, we're not here for charity. While we as individuals are not looking to make any money, the box office proceeds from each venture will feed the next. The idea is to produce something exciting and entertaining. We don't want to tell stories of puritan, chaste women, but women who are as real and powerful as men. It's not just the stories, but also who's making them. In 2002, 7% of directors were female. It's 2016 now, and that number still stands at 7%. We're looking at female-driven stories made by female directors. Our first project is going to be a compilation of six to seven short stories. Each of these is a project that a female director or producer wanted to make. These will be released together as a feature film or TV series. One of them is a story I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to be producing it and acting in it too. Have you done any roles that you now feel catered to stereotypes? I have done many roles that were stereotypical! When I started off, I would think, 'If I don't take up this offer, maybe I won't get anything else.' When I took up Day of the Falcon, I wasn't very sure about the character. When I read it on paper, I wanted to give it a stronger presence. In the end, I didn't entirely go with my gut instinct. I can't tell others what to do but I personally have now come to a place in my life where if I'm offered a role that may be construed as sexist or degrading to women, I refuse to do it. I have the responsibility and power to say no. Any roles you've refused? I was offered a stereotypical role of an Indian call centre employee who spoke in a very desi accent. It also had a very disrespectful reference to the 2012 gang rape in Delhi. I immediately threw up my hands and refused the role. Any recent female characters that you have loved? Last year, Room was one of the most phenomenal movies. It was nice to get an insight into the life of a woman who was traumatized and wasn't the perfect mother at times, and that's fine. You shouldn't make a lesser film by telling the story of a perfect woman. Cate Blanchett's character in Blue Jasmine and Alicia Vikander's in The Danish Girl were also good to see. In Bollywood, Deepika's performance in Piku was refreshing. I'm working with Richa Chadha on Love Sonia. She's done a fair amount of powerful roles. And Shefali Shah is out of this world! I loved Kangana in Queen; she was vulnerable, funny and empowered all at the same time. Women aren't black and white all the time, and shouldn't be portrayed so. Actors like Cameron Diaz, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Olivia Wilde have brought up the issue of ageism in Hollywood. Your take on it? The issue very much exists. There's a disparity in the way men and women are viewed. For instance, Tom Cruise can be in his 50s and still be Ethan Hunt and romance 22-year-olds on screen. But when female actors hit 35 or 37, or god forbid the 40-mark, they are relegated to playing mothers or grandmothers  older characters who aren't sexually active anymore... all the female body parts suddenly disappear! We're still here, the same people having the same kind of fun men like to have. Female actors seem to have a shelf life in the industry. I personally feel that in my 30s, I'm more aware of who I am than I was in my 20s. Doesn't it mean I should get better roles now? But that's not the case. We want to address this issue by coming up with amazing stories of women well into their 40s, 50s, and 60s. They can be very entertaining as well. Has the issue of whitewashing affected you? Does your ethnicity dictate roles? From the very onset of my career, my team pushed out the message, 'Yes, she's Indian, but she's not interested in playing Indian roles only, especially not the stereotypical ones.' So I haven't faced that issue. As far as whitewashing goes, TV is way ahead of films in diversity. There's also a problem with the way Asian actors are cast. Filmmakers shouldn't add a token Indian girl for the sake of diversity; give her something real to do.</text>

	<text>We talk of 'aspirational India', but how easy is it today for a talented young Indian to overcome material disadvantage? Anirudh Krishna, professor of public policy at Duke University and currently visiting fellow at JNU, shares insights from his research on social mobility with Amulya Gopalakrishnan What are the chances of young Indians from disadvantaged backgrounds making it to the new economic opportunities available today? People who are better prepared in India, who have higher college degrees from well-known institutions, have climbed very high. But several others have not had the same opportunities. Research shows that people educated in rural areas rarely make it into higher-paying professions. Similarly, those who are not educated in English-medium schools (more than 80% of all students) and those whose parents have less than a high-school education (more than 90%) continue to experience severe disadvantages, as do SCs and STs, especially if they are also poor and also rural. They are more than 60% of the population, but people educated in rural schools constitute less than 3% of the intake of business schools and engineering colleges. A vicious cycle operates for people who grow up in poorer and more remote communities. Where no one has climbed high in the past, no one knows for sure which pathways lead upward. There are many smart, hardworking kids in poorer communities. They lack role models. They lack access to career information: what good jobs (or other ways of making a decent living) exist out there? What does it take to get into one of these occupations? How do I measure up against the competition? The education they get is often of poor quality. They get no support of a confidence-building nature. That's not just a problem for the individuals concerned. Low individual achievements across a broad front lead to overall poor national performance. India consistently wins the lowest number of Olympic medals per thousand population. On other measures too  patents applied for, new businesses registered, research papers published  India does poorly in relation to its vast human potential. What kind of groups have improved their prospects over the last three decades? The most heartening trend has been the rise of education. For instance, in Rajasthan and Karnataka, two states where I studied intergenerational differences, no more than 15% of rural grandparents have five or more years of education. But 70% of those aged 11-20 years have at least this level of education. And these numbers keep rising. Another heartening change has been the increased representation of women in higher-paying professions. In the 1960s, there were almost no women in elite engineering or management institutions. But 20% of the recent intake into top-tier B-schools, and 40% in top-tier engineering colleges, is women. It's still not 50%, but it's headed in that direction. Another group that has improved its position consists of youth from smaller towns and district capitals. A greater proportion of these individuals, compared to 20 years ago, have been making it into higher-paying positions. How effectively has education propelled people ahead? The threshold level after which education makes a big difference has risen considerably in recent years. On account of tech advancements, an ever-higher level of education is required. At least a high-school diploma, and more usually a college degree, are necessary in order to gain a big jump in earnings. But few people still have this level of education. Only 15% of rural individuals in the 18-24 age group were attending educational institutions in 2008; even fewer among poorer households and remoter areas. To cater to the rising demand, colleges of indifferent quality have proliferated. Many families that have bet their shirts on education will be disappointed to find that this education has only rendered their child "unemployable." There's a great deal of frustration building up. To what extent does migrating to cities help? Families who can afford these costs have moved their children to towns, where they attend better schools and become part of an environment where talking about jobs and careers is common. These children, with richer parents, have progressed. Others, including child labourers, haven't. Migrating to cities has proven to be a layered experience. How can social policy be rebooted to encourage mobility. Could you suggest three steps? * Improve the quality of education in public schools by giving teachers more autonomy and parents more oversight. * Invest in a programme for superior role model development: over the next years, help build up at least one high-performing individual from every village and every poorer urban community. * Attitudes and beliefs often limit the prospects of people who are thought by others to be "lower" (and thus less deserving of a brighter future). It is not often mentioned in policy reform discussions, but changing attitudes is critically important.</text>

	<text>Anecdotally, it is often said that engineers tend to lean rightwards in their politics. In their new book, Engineers of Jihad, sociologist Diego Gambetta and political scientist Steffen Hertog back up that gut sense with data. They find that Islamist radicalism and other far-right movements are dominated by engineers, doctors and those with tech backgrounds, while left-wing movements draw people from the humanities and social sciences. They tell TOI why this may be the case In your study of political radicals in the Muslim world, you found that college-educated Islamist extremists are, overwhelmingly, engineers. How does this challenge the conventional wisdom about jihadis? We found that about almost half of the Islamist extremists in our sample from many Muslim countries have either a degree or some university exposure, so this means that there is another half that has not gone above high school. It is among those who have a degree or university exposure that 45% are engineers. This means that, relative to other graduates, the odds are about 5-6 times higher that an Islamist extremist has an engineering background. If the term of reference group is the adult male population, rather than graduates alone, then the chances of finding an engineer are 17 times greater. The conventional idea that poverty fuels Islamism is clearly not borne out by our data. Rather, militant Islamism got its original support from frustrated would-be elites, individuals who had invested greatly in their education, and hoped to play prominent roles in the modernisation of their countries, but who then crashed against the economic downturn that hit Muslim countries from the late 1970s onward. That is also the time when we first witness the emergence of the Islamist movement, both violent and peaceful. Why is this the case? What kinds of traits does a technical education foster? Let us break it down into sequential questions: What kind of traits matter? Political psychologists have found that three traits are correlated with being right-wing and conservative: these traits are to be easily disgusted (say, by corruption of customs or by perceived social deviance such as homosexuality), to be strongly in favour of one's ethnic or religious in-group and against infidels and immigrants from other cultures, and to be intolerant of ambiguity and uncertainty - something that psychologists call "need for closure". Why does this matter? We have found that the ideology of Islamists and that of far-right militants have very large areas of overlap, while neither has much overlap at all with far left-wing ideology. What has all this got to do with engineers? We found that engineers are significantly present, not only among Islamists but also on the far right, but not on the far left, where humanities and social science graduates dominate. And at the same time, using the European Social Survey from many European countries, we found that engineers have those three traits to a higher intensity than people with other degrees, and this probably explains why they are attracted by right-wing and Islamist ideologies, which promise to clean up societies of corruption, to strengthen their cultural identity, and to offer an authoritarian order. Conversely, among humanities and social science graduates the traits are less pronounced - which is the case among women, too, who also end up on the radical left much more frequently. Lastly, what has a technical education got to do with this? We believe that the degree which one chooses to pursue is a crude window into personality traits, and that people's traits influence both their political behaviour and their educational choices, rather than the other way around. So a technical education (and the company of like-minded individuals) may reinforce those traits - for instance the idea that every problem has an optimal solution and, hence, the compromise typical of democracies is to be abhorred - but it is unlikely that it creates them from scratch. Would you suggest that this mindset is drawn mostly to religious movements? Political psychologists find that different ideologies satisfy different cognitive and emotional needs. Insofar as a religious fundamentalist movement satisfies the three traits mentioned, then it should prove attractive. However, there are also secular groups and institutions that can do the same: while in the US and in the Islamic world, religion and extremist groups are mixed, in Europe extremist groups find their ideological match among nationalistic, populist parties and support strong authoritarian state institutions, rather than religion. Your data shows that left-wing radicals tend to come from humanities and social science backgrounds. Why do their sympathies veer towards social justice movements rather than religious ones? It is true that left wingers seem to respond more vigorously to social injustice, while right wingers and Islamists seem to respond more to corruption or breaches of tradition and cultural-ethnic integrity - the former look forward to a future of progress and want to upend existing hierarchies, while the latter look backward revelling in nostalgia for a mythical past orders.' Your question of whether these differences also predict whether left-wingers will not overall be attracted by religious ideologies is an interesting one; we do not deal with it in the book, but if we were to speculate, we could point out that by and large it seems true that left-wingers are more likely to entertain secular ideologies. Interestingly, however, a religion that left-wingers have been drawn to (and vice versa) - especially in Latin America from the 1970s onward - has been a brand of Catholicism. It is a religion in which social injustice can be invoked, thanks to certain readings of the Gospels, as a relatively more important value than in other religions which tend to more readily accept social and economic hierarchies. So it is not that left-wingers are necessarily averse to religion as that most religions seem to be distant from what matters to them.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Mugly, who was crowned as the World's Ugliest Dog in 2012, has won the Hero award here for serving as a therapy dog and helping adults and children with disabilities. Mugly, a 12-year-old Chinese Crested dog, has been working as voluntary therapy pet for the past six years, participating in reading programmes for children and visiting adults with physical disabilities and learning challenges as part of a British organisation, Therapy Dogs Nationwide. He won an award for 'Most Heroic Hound' at the SuperDogs awards at the National Pet Show in London last week, the Daily Express reported. Mugly was abandoned by a breeder when he was just three-days-old. Then, he grew into a very ugly dog - so ugly that a panel of judges in the US crowned him the World's Ugliest Dog in 2012 and Britain's ugliest dog in 2005. Besides regularly visiting schools as part of the Read to Dogs scheme - an initiative that encourages nervous readers to speak out loud to boost their confidence - he is also involved in a project that lets children feel comfortable with animals. In addition, he works with adults who have learning disorders and disabilities. He's been a certified therapy dog since 2010. "He amazes me with his ability to know exactly how to be when he meets people. With a blind person, he stands completely still and lets them explore him; or when someone is upset, he pushes his body into them for comfort." said his owner Bev Nicholson. According to the American Kennel Club, Chinese crested dog is "a toy dog, fine-boned, elegant and graceful. The distinct varieties are born in the same litter. The Hairless with hair only on the head, tail and feet and the Powderpuff, completely covered with hair. The breed serves as a loving companion, playful and entertaining. "He is a bit like Marmite, some people love him and other people don't. Older people want a big fluffy dog to hug, not Mugly," Nicholson said. He's been on multiple TV shows, including Mutt Ugly (Ch5) Ronnie's Animal Crackers (BBC1) and A Different Breed (Sky1).</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said as US President he would make an exception for London's first Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan in his proposed temporary ban on the entry of Muslims to the US and hoped that the Labour leader would set an example. "I was happy to see that. I think it's a very good thing, and I hope he does a very good job because frankly that would be very, very good," Trump told The New York Times when asked about the election of Khan as the new London mayor. Khan, who has been critical of Trump's policies, had earlier said he would not be able to travel to the US if the 69-year-old tycoon was elected as the president of the US. But Trump stated otherwise, when asked about it. "There will always be exceptions," he said. "Because I think if he does a great job, it will really -- you lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job and frankly if he does a great job, that would be a terrific thing," Trump said. On Sunday, Pakistani-origin Khan had accused British Prime Minister David Cameron's ruling Conservative party of using "fear and innuendo" in a bid to turn religious and ethnic groups against each other during the mayoral campaign and said the tactics were straight out of the "Donald Trump playbook". "They used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other -- something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. Londoners deserved better and I hope it's something the Conservative party will never try to repeat," the Labour leader had said.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A married lesbian couple from India has lost their legal battle to stay in the UK on the grounds that their relationship would not be legally recognised in India. The couple, who cannot be named for legal reasons, arrived from India as friends in 2007 and went on to enter into a civil partnership in Scotland in 2008, which they converted into marriage last year. Judges at the UK's court of appeal rejected their application to remain in the UK on the grounds that their relationship would not be legally recognised in their home country of India. According to the 'Guardian', they both completed Master's degrees in Scotland and then found work and have always lived on legal visas in the UK and now want to acquire an "Indefinite Leave to Remain" in the country. The Court of Appeal, however, analysed background material on India and accepted that India provided no legal protection or recognition of same-sex couples but felt their return to India would not be a violation of their right to a family life as there was no evidence the couple would suffer violence on return. "My family do not know that I am a lesbian or that I am married. If I return home they will treat me as a single woman and start looking for a suitable husband for me," one of the women who cannot be identified was quoted as saying by the report. "I won't have any legal protection for who I am because my marriage will not be recognised in India. In India we will both have to hide who we are. In the UK we enjoy our family life together," she said. The couple's barrister, S Chelvan, said: "This is a landmark judgment, as it is the first case from the Court of Appeal to address the balancing of the rights of migrant same-sex couples to legal recognition and protection, with immigration control and economic interests of the UK." The couple are now planning to appeal against the decision to the UK's Supreme Court.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The British government on Wednesday said it can't deport loans defaulter Vijay Mallya and asked India to consider requesting extradition, instead. Britain also acknowledged "the seriousness of allegations" against Mallya and said it is "keen to assist" the Indian government. "They have asked GoI (Government of India) to consider requesting mutual legal assistance or extradition," said Vikas Swarup, spokesman, ministry of external affairs. "The UK Government has informed us that under 1971 Immigration Act, the UK does not require an individual to hold a valid passport in order to remain in the UK if they have extant leave to remain as long as their passport was valid when leave to remain or enter UK was conferred. At same time, UK acknowledges the seriousness of allegations &amp; is keen to assist GoI," Swarup further said. That means, Mallya can legally stay in Britain if his passport was valid when he entered the country. He left India on March 2 and the Indian government revoked his passport only after that, which means his passport was valid when he entered the UK. Mallya owes more than Rs 9,000 crores to Indian banks. After he left, he has ignored three summonses by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in relation to a money laundering case. Since then, court has also issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against the iquor baron. "What I have learned so far is that deportation can't be allowed if someone entered the UK with a valid passport even if it is cancelled later", said finance minister Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha. "An alternative process is that when a chargesheet is filed after an investigation, extradition has to be demanded," he added. India wrote to the British High Commission in Delhi last month requesting that Mallya be deported to India. The liquor baron's advocate had expressed apprehensions in court that if Mallya returned, he may be taken straight to Tihar Jail from Delhi airport. In April, the external affairs ministry emphasized that India will vigorously pursue Mallya's deportation. Read this story in Telugu Read this story in Marathi</text>

	<text>LONDON: Queen Elizabeth II has been overheard on video calling Chinese officials "very rude" in a conversation with a senior police officer at a Buckingham Palace event. The comments, made Tuesday, were unusual because the 90-year-old monarch rarely comments publicly on political matters, and media accompanying her are asked not to eavesdrop on private conversations. The incident came hours after Prime Minister David Cameron was caught on microphone calling Nigeria and Afghanistan "fantastically corrupt." The queen's comments, recorded by the palace's official cameraman at a palace garden party and distributed to broadcasters, captured police Commander Lucy D'Orsi telling the queen that arranging the state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping in October had been a "testing time." Elizabeth responded: "They were very rude to the ambassador." In the video, an official introduced the queen to D'Orsi and explains that the officer was in charge of policing for the visit. The queen responded: "Oh! Bad luck." The official tells the queen that D'Orsi had been "seriously undermined by the Chinese" in the handling of the visit. When D'Orsi asked if the queen knew it had been a "testing time," the monarch interjected: "I did." The officer recalled a moment when Chinese officials walked out of a meeting with Barbara Woodward, British ambassador to China, in which the Chinese told the Brits the trip was off. "They walked out on both of us," D'Orsi said. "Extraordinary," the queen said. "It was very rude and undiplomatic I thought," D'Orsi said. Both the Metropolitan police and the palace refused to comment on what they described as private conversations. The palace stressed that Xi's visit had been "extremely successful." British officials laid on dollops of pomp and splendor  including a state banquet at the palace  during Xi's four-day state visit to nurture the U.K.'s developing economic relationship with China. The two countries signed more than 30 billion pounds ($46 billion) in trade agreements during the trip, and Cameron said Britain would be China's "partner of choice" in the West. Asked about the queen's reported remarks at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang declined to address them directly, but said Xi had made a "very successful visit" to Britain last year. "The working teams from both sides made huge efforts to make this possible. This effort has been highly recognized by both China and Britain," Lu said. Despite Lu's comments, China appeared to regard the reports as sensitive. Information about the queen's comments was difficult to find on China's heavily censored Internet and government monitors cut the signal of the British Broadcasting Company when it reported on the comments. British foreign secretary Philip Hammond said the visit "got a bit stressful on both sides" but had been "highly successful." He said that "our relationship with China is very strong and has been greatly strengthened by the success of that visit." This is not the first time British royals have been caught making undiplomatic remarks about the Chinese. Prince Charles branded Chinese diplomats "appalling old waxworks" in a private journal entry that had described the 1997 ceremony to hand Hong Kong back to Chinese rule. Charles, who is friends with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, did not attend a state banquet for Xi in October, but did hold private talks with the Chinese leader over tea. At another palace reception Tuesday, cameras recorded Cameron talking about an anti-corruption summit in London, which he will chair. "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain," Cameron told the monarch. "Nigeria and Afghanistan  possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world." Afghanistan's Ashraf Ghani and Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari are due to attend the London summit and each has contributed an essay on his efforts to tackle graft.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Britain will on Thursday announce plans to reform the BBC that could give the government greater influence over the public broadcaster, but proposals for large-scale cuts have been watered down. The broadcaster would be regulated by an external organisation, the independent media watchdog Ofcom, for the first time in its 90-year history under the proposals in the government's white paper. It would also have a new board to run day-to-day matters that could include government appointees, although the BBC would name at least half the members amid concern that its editorial independence could be compromised. Media minister John Whittingdale is due to present the white paper in parliament later Thursday, and it will be debated by MPs later this year before a renewal of the BBC's governing charter is agreed. Relations between Prime Minister David Cameron's centre-right Conservative party and the BBC have long been tense, with some MPs accusing the broadcaster of left-wing bias, which it denies. Celebrities including James Bond star Daniel Craig and Harry Potter author JK Rowling have warned against cuts at the broadcaster  nicknamed "Auntie" due to its once-ubiquitous presence in British homes. The BBC is currently funded through an annual licence fee of 145.50 (184 euros, $210) which all British households with a television have to pay. This raises over 3.7 billion per year. The BBC has already been forced cut jobs and budgets in an austerity drive after agreeing last year to pay the 600 million annual cost of providing free television licences for people aged over 75, which had been previously funded by the government. Under the plans due to be unveiled on Thursday, the licence fee would be allowed to rise in line with inflation and viewers would be charged to watch programmes on the BBC's iPlayer digital platform. "This will give the BBC the financial certainty it needs and increase its independence from government," read an extract from the white paper released to the media ahead of its official publication. "The BBC is a world-class broadcaster and one of our country's greatest institutions. Our plans will mean that the BBC will keep making the great programmes we love and will continue to thrive in the future," a government source said. The BBC Trust, which currently regulates the broadcaster, would be abolished and the BBC would have to disclose salaries of employees that exceed the director general's pay of 450,000 a year. Lawmaker Waheed Alli, founder of the Great BBC Campaign, said that "any changes must not compromise the BBC's independence, affect the BBC's funding from the licence fee or diminish the BBC's mission to educate, inform and entertain the whole country".</text>

	<text>A video has surfaced on the cyberspace showing the British Queen criticizing Chinese officials as "very rude". The comments were made duringChinese president Xi Jinping's visit last year which was heralded by both governments as the "golden era" of bilateral relationship. "They were very rude to the ambassador," the Queen is heard saying in the video referring to the first woman British Ambassador to China, Barbara Woodward. Observers said the Queen's remarks would affect the relationship at a crucial time when Britain was considering whether to exit from European Union and might need enhanced investments from China. Relationship between the two countries have become intense in the past year with London describing it as a "Golden era" of ties. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry did not directly discuss the leaked video in reply to questions posed by journalists. But it suggested that the video may not affect the relationship. "President Xi's visit to the UK last year was a very successful one. Both sides have made great efforts for the success of the visit and both parties recognised that," Lu Kang, ministry spokesman said. The video shows the Queen being introduced to Metropolitan Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi. She is told that the commander had overseen security during president Xi's visit to the UK last October. D'Orsi: "I was the Gold Commander so I'm not sure whether you knew, but it was quite a testing time for..." Queen: "Oh, bad luck." D'Orsi: "It was at the point they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off, that I felt..." The Queen: "They were very rude to the ambassador." D'Orsi: "They were... it was very rude and undiplomatic I thought." The Queen: "Extraordinary". BBC quoted a Buckingham Palace spokesman saying, "We do not comment on the Queen's private conversations. "However, the Chinese State Visit was extremely successful and all parties worked closely to ensure it proceeded smoothly." Royal garden parties are filmed by the cameraman who covers the palace for UK broadcasters. British foreign secretary Philip Hammond said that "at times it got a bit stressful on both sides" but that state visits were big logistical challenges. Earlier, British prime minister David Cameron was overheard saying Afghanistan and Nigeria were "fantastically corrupt".</text>

	<text>LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron was caught on camera telling Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday that leaders of some "fantastically corrupt" countries, including Nigeria and Afghanistan, were due to attend his anti-corruption summit. Cameron will host an international anti-corruption summit on Thursday aimed at stepping up global action to combat corruption in all walks of life. In a pooled video feed made available to the Independent Television News (ITN) broadcaster, Cameron was shown talking with the queen about the summit. "We had a very successful cabinet meeting this morning, talking about our anti-corruption summit," Cameron said when the queen approached. He added, "We have got the Nigerians, actually we have got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain." Cameron went on to say, "Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly two of the most corrupt countries in the world." The queen did not respond to Cameron's comment but the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said, "But this particular president is actually not corrupt." Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, both of whom are due to attend the summit, acknowledge corruption in their countries and have pledged to clean it up. Afghanistan is at number 166, second-from-bottom, in campaign group Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index, an annual ranking of countries. Only North Korea and Somalia, jointly ranked at number 167, are perceived to be more corrupt. Nigeria is at number 136 in the index. It was not clear whether Cameron realized that he was being filmed and recorded at the event at Buckingham Palace. A bystander then joked to laughter, "They are coming at their own expense one assumes?" "Everything has to be open," Cameron said. "There are no sort of closed-door sessions. Everything has to be in front of the press. It's going to be, it could be, quite interesting." When asked about the comments, Downing Street did not immediately respond.</text>

	<text>LONDON: London's first Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan on Tuesday hit out at Donald Trump for signalling that he would exempt him from his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, saying his "ignorant" comments play "into the hands of extremists". The US presidential hopeful had said in an interview to the 'The New York Times' that he was happy to see Khan take over his new post and that "there will always be exceptions" to his controversial Muslim ban comments. "This isn't just about me. It's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world," Khan said in his rebuttal. "Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists. Donald Trump and those around him think that western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong," the 44-year-old newly-elected mayor added. Khan told the BBC he is supporting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in her bid for the White House: "I hope she trounces him (Trump)." Last year, 69-year-old Trump had called for a temporary halt to all Muslims entering the US in the wake of the deadly terror attack in San Bernardino, California. He said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on". Labour MP Khan, the son of a Pakistani bus driver, had likened to Trump's campaign with the Conservative party's tactics in the mayoral elections. "They (Conservatives) used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other - something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook," he wrote in an article after being sworn in to his post over the weekend. Khan officially took charge of City Hall in London on Saturday following Thursday's election, which saw him defeat his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith by 1,310,143 votes to 994,614 - giving him one of the largest personal mandate for any UK politician.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: The British media is riddled with "barbarians" who would benefit from a lesson in manners from China's ancient civilisation, a state-run newspaper said Thursday after Queen Elizabeth II called some Chinese officials "very rude". In a rare diplomatic gaffe, the British monarch was caught on camera at a Buckingham Palace garden party making unguarded comments about a state visit last year by President Xi Jinping that drummed up billions in Chinese investment. The remarks made headlines worldwide on Wednesday but initially they were largely censored in China, blacked out of BBC World transmissions, according to the British broadcaster. The Global Times newspaper, which is close to China's ruling Communist Party, blamed the British media for blowing the incident out of proportion and fawning over the footage as if it was "the most precious treasure". "The West in modern times has risen to the top and created a brilliant civilisation, but their media is full of reckless 'gossip fiends' who bare their fangs and brandish their claws and are very narcissistic, retaining the bad manners of 'barbarians'," it said in an editorial. "As they experience constant exposure to the 5,000 years of continuous Eastern civilisation, we believe they will make progress" when it comes to manners, it added in the Chinese-language piece, which was not published in English. London and Beijing have both proclaimed a new "golden era" of relations between the former imperial power -- whose forces repeatedly invaded China in the 19th century -- and the rising Asian giant, now the world's second-largest economy. Xi's trip in October saw a clutch of contracts announced, which Cameron said were worth almost $58 billion. At the time the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official mouthpiece, breathlessly portraying the visit as the start of a beautiful friendship. But in her recorded comments the Queen commiserated with a police commander for her "bad luck" in having to oversee security for Xi and his wife. Members of the Chinese delegation "were very rude to the ambassador", the monarch said, exclaiming: "Extraordinary!" A columnist at Chinese website "Today's Headlines" recalled visible mutual discomfort during the three-day sojourn, describing it as "thought-provoking awkwardness" and adding it "primarily arose out of cultural and political differences". On Chinese social media posters decried Britain's lack of awareness and understanding of Chinese ways, noting "an arrogance which makes them feel they needn't bother to learn". "Every country's customs are different, OK - not all people must cater to you," wrote a commenter on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Others were ashamed. "We're already embarrassed by talk about what our average people get up to abroad," said one. "Being embarrassed by our officials abroad is even worse." The British monarch never expresses overtly political views in public and is known for her discretion, never granting an interview in her 64-year reign. But her comments came as British Prime Minister David Cameron was recorded calling Nigeria and Afghanistan "possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world", heaping scrutiny on the tete-a-tetes of British leadership. "Even among Western countries, Britain is most frequently 'caught with its pants down' and 'exposing itself'," the Global Times editorial said. But it added that it would be "unthinkable" for British authorities to have deliberately leaked the royal footage, as "if they had deliberately done so, that would have been truly crude and rude". The paper shrugged off the Queen's comments themselves as "not a big deal", stating: "Chinese diplomats surely also scoff at British bureaucrats in private."</text>

	<text>LONDON: The site where Britain's Princess Diana is buried is set for a 20 million pound makeover to mark the 20th anniversary of her death. Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997, was laid to rest at the Althorp estate in Northamptonshire, in the east Midlands region of England. Her brother, Earl Spencer, is now spearheading a move to revamp the estate owned by her family. A statement on Althorp's website reads: "The Oval Lake where Diana, Princess of Wales, was laid to rest on September 6, 1997, is undergoing an extensive redesign to honour her memory. "It will be completed in time for the 20th anniversary of her death, in August 2017. The island at Althorp is in the process of undergoing extensive remodelling, along with the rest of Althorp's gardens." It marks the first major revamp of the gardens in 350 years, 'Sunday Mirror' reported. The third wife of Earl Spencer, Lady Karen, will be in charge of the project. Althorp's gardens were first designed by Andre Le Notre, King Louis XIV of France's principal gardener, in the 17th century. "Please tidy up the vegetation on the island," Diana's personal chef Darren McGrady had tweeted after a visit to the site in 2014. The revamp in seen as overdue in memory of the mother of Prince William and Harry, who had divorced their father Prince Charles a year before her death in 1996.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A British Airways A380 Superjumbo with a stunning square-shaped tyre has landed at London's Heathrow airport, baffling aviation experts. The deflated tyre with a square shape was part of the landing gear on the flight BA-32 arriving from Hong Kong on Friday. The Airbus A380-800 was climbing out of Hong Kong close to reaching the top of climb when the crew received a tyre pressure indication, Aviation Herald reported. The crew decided to continue the 13-hour flight to London and requested a tow tug to be available for landing in case the aircraft would not be able to taxi on its own. "The aircraft landed safely on Heathrow's runway 09L and taxied to the gate," the report said. A British Airways spokeswoman said the plane landed "normally" with one of its 18 tyres deflated, adding: "The A380, in common with other large commercial aircraft, is designed to be perfectly safe when landing with a deflated tyre." The crew was left puzzled when an inspection found that the right outboard body tyre had deflated on four corners, rather than just at the bottom, as is usual. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said he had not seen anything like the tyre before. Aviation experts, commenting on the photograph square- shaped tyre of the A380, said they are stunned by it. One serving airline captain said the tyre probably detached from the wheel on landing when the brakes were applied, but stressed that the aircraft was never in danger. He added: "The tyres are pressurised to around seven times that of a car tyre. Once depressurised the tyre will have 'flatted' while the a/c was braking and once it did so it would then rotate through 90 degrees to another part of the tyre and then do it again - hence the four flats you see. "Is it dangerous? No. To lose one is no big deal," the captain was quoted as saying by The Sun. The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner. It is the world's largest passenger airliner that provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration.</text>

	<text>He has shot to fame as London's first 'Muslim' mayor. And the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, a Hindu shrine, is among Saqid Khans's favourite places in the city. In a recent Facebook post, Khan has expressed his fondness for the temple. Pictures of Khan visiting the temple days before being elected as the mayor have gone viral where Khan is seen interacting with people from other faiths at the temple. He even holds out his hand for a priest to tie a string around his wrist, in keeping with a Hindu custom. Khan has declared his intentions to stand up for the London's Indian community and further strengthen the city's friendship with India. He called himself the 'most pro-business' London mayor ever, and expressed interest in leading a trade delegation to India. He also vowed to challenge the present government's 'unfair visa restrictions' that often make it difficult for businesses to find the best skilled employees.</text>

	<text>LONDON: A London temporary worker, sent home for wearing flat shoes, has collected more than 120,000 signatures so far in a petition calling for Britain to make it illegal for a firm to require women to wear high heels at work. Reaching that total on Friday easily put Nicola Thorp's petition over the 100,000-signature threshold needed to have Britain's parliament consider holding a debate on an issue. Thorp made headlines this week when she launched her campaign describing how she had arrived in flat shoes for her first day to work as a receptionist for accounting company PwC last December to be told she had to wear heels. She told British media she refused an offer to go buy a pair of heels and was sent home without pay. Portico, the agency through which Thorp got the job, had set the uniform guidelines and has since reviewed and revised its policy upon PwC's request. It now says "all our female colleagues can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer". Thorp started the government petition this week, saying "current formal work dress codes are out-dated and sexist". "Employers are allowed to impose different dress codes for men and women, which is fair enough as long as that dress code doesn't favour one of the sexes," Thorp told Britain's ITN television. "By making women wear high heels you are acting favourably towards men because their footwear doesn't affect their posture, their ability to move. It doesn't create long term health problems."</text>

	<text>ORLANDO: Britain's Prince Harry and first lady Michelle Obama helped kick off the Invictus Games for wounded veterans with uplifting speeches, joining other figures from the worlds of sports, entertainment and politics in a glittery opening ceremony. The two-hour event in Orlando, Florida, included performances by British singer James Blunt and soprano Laura Wright. Actor Morgan Freeman and former president George W Bush honorary chairman of this year's games sat in the audience for the ceremonial start of the games at Disney's ESPN Wide World of Sports Champion Stadium. Nearly 500 athletes from 14 different countries are competing in the Paralympic-style sports competition over a four-day period beginning Monday. The Invictus Games are the creation of Prince Harry, who got the inspiration to help wounded and sick military personnel and their families after his two tours of duty in Afghanistan. The initial Invictus Games were held last year in London. "I can't tell you how proud I am to have the second Invictus Games open in America," Prince Harry said. "I'm a long way from London tonight, but when I look out, I see so many familiar faces, servicemen and women, their friends and their families and all of the people who got them here. I feel like I'm at home." The evening began with participants dressed in their nation's colors marching into Champion Stadium to a standing ovation from the crowd. There were several musical performances and then three veterans spoke about the injuries they suffered and their fight to regain control of their lives. "I served along soldiers from all over the world," Prince Harry said. "I saw the sacrifices you and your families made to serve your nations. I learned about the importance of team work and camaraderie in the way that only military service can teach you." There was a military flyover and the black and yellow "I Am" flag, which has become the symbol of the Invictus Games, was flown by helicopter into the stadium. There was also a fireworks show. The first lady spoke toward the end of the ceremony. "It is truly an honor to be here tonight to help kick off this year's Invictus Games," she said. "I want to, of course, start by thanking Prince Harry for his outstanding leadership and for bringing the Invictus Games here to Orlando. He is truly our Prince Charming. He should be proud of his work."</text>

	<text>LONDON: Does one person really need 900 horses to tell their life story? Well, maybe if they're 90 years old, have ruled over Britain for decades and really love horses. For Queen Elizabeth II, it's not just a birthday, it's a birthday season. And the four-day, 900-horse, 1,500-human extravaganza that begins Thursday is a spectacle marking the midpoint, halfway between her real birthday in April and her official birthday, to be celebrated nationally in early June. The festival will climax on Sunday evening with a national televised show to be attended by the queen and her husband Prince Philip. It is taking place at the same time as the Royal Windsor Horse Show, on part of the estate that includes Windsor Castle, one of the queen's favorite retreats. This festival is designed with the queen's passions in mind. There's no doubt the queen is dutiful, fulfilling thousands of official obligations since 1952, but little doubt that being around horses is what she really enjoys. Even on official foreign trips, she often schedules a free morning or afternoon to check out equine culture in the countries she's visiting, sometimes confounding schedulers by tarrying too long. Thus the organizers have decreed: Let there be horses aplenty. And let there be singers and theater acts and dancers as well. The evening performances promise to be eclectic in the extreme and possibly a bit kitschy: Dancers and singers will be coming from all parts of the globe, including Oman, Chile, New Zealand, Canada and Azerbaijan. Military bands and 100 pipers will get their time onstage as well. Organizers have built on the success of a similar pageant held four years ago to mark the queen's Diamond Jubilee, but that was small beer- only 556 horses. This time, they've upped the number to 900, 10 for each of the queen's years. Viewers who watch from home are likely to see something quite rare. It's almost guaranteed that the often stern monarch, known for keeping her emotions in check, will smile once or twice at the feats of horsemanship on display.</text>

	<text>LONDON: In the wake of the Panama Papers leaks, David Cameron will host an anti-corruption summit in London on Thursday. The summit will be attended by world leaders, NGO's and financial institutions. About 40 countries have been invited to the summit, alongside bodies such as the World Bank and the IMF. Presidents of Afghanistan, Colombia and Nigeria and US Secretary of State John Kerry are among those who are due to attend the summit. "Corruption is an enemy of progress and the root of so many of the world's problems," Cameron said. Campaigners are hoping for concrete action in response to public outrage over the revelations in the Panama Papers of how the rich and powerful hide their money. They want governments to expose the beneficiaries of anonymous companies used to move money without detection, and take further action to reduce the secrecy of offshore tax havens where they are incorporated. A Downing Street spokesman said the summit declaration would commit signatories "to expose corruption wherever it is found, to pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it". "It will also promise to ensure that corruption "does not fester" in government, business or communities", the spokesman said. Robert Barrington, UK executive director of advocacy group Transparency International, said Cameron should "not give in" to attempts to limit the summit's ambitions. "The Prime Minister has created a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption, and now it is up to others to show they share the same ambition," he said. Cameron has led international calls to tackle aggressive tax avoidance and evasion and global corruption, but was embarrassed last month when his late father's Bahamas based investment fund was revealed in the Panama leaks. The release of 11.5 million confidential documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca also shone a spotlight on the secrecy of Britain's overseas tax havens. More than 113,000 out of the 210,000 companies exposed were registered in the British Virgin Islands. Next month, Britain will introduce a public register on who ultimately benefits from British registered companies, the first G20 and EU nation to do so. But campaigners want London to extend the measure to its overseas territories. "If you're going to stake out a claim to be a leader, clean out your own backyard," said John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network advocacy group. More than 300 economists, including former IMF economist Oliver Blanchard and France's Thomas Piketty, urged world leaders to end offshore financial secrecy, saying tax havens "serve no useful economic purpose". Kerry is also under pressure to address the lack of transparency in US states such as Delaware and Wyoming, where anonymous companies can be created for just a few hundred dollars. The Panama leaks also highlighted how global elites used offshore companies to buy expensive London property, fuelling concerns of money laundering through the capital.</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK general secretary J Jayalalithaa on Saturday exuded confidence that her party will have a landslide victory in the May 16 assembly election. In a letter to party cadres, Jayalalithaa recalled her campaign meetings which started in Chennai on April 9 and ended in Tirunelveli on May 12. She thanked the public for coming in large numbers to attend the meetings. "The enthusiastic welcome given by lakhs of men and women has made me happy. Looking at the overwhelming response to the meetings, I feel the party will win a landslide. I thank the people for showering their affection," Jayalalithaa said in the letter sent to the party cadres on the on the last day of campaigning. Attacking DMK chief M Karunanidhi and his family for their alleged involvement in the 2G and bad maintenance of law and order in the state, Jayalalithaa said, "Following the big victory in 2011, I took steps to bring about law and order in the state and thereby safeguard your lives and property." The chief minister also recalled steps taken by her to settle the Cauvery and Mullaperiyar issues by approaching the Supreme Court. "In the last five years, women empowerment was given importance by implementing several schemes for them and 50% was reserved for women in local bodies. Police and other departments functioned independently without any political interference," said Jayalalithaa. Recalling the welfare measures taken by the AIADMK government, she said laptops were distributed to students thereby bridging the gap between city and village with regard to information technology. "There are more such welfare measures listed in the party manifesto and for me to complete all these, cadres must vote for two leaves symbol in the coming election," she said. The AIADMK chief wanted party cadres to be alert during polling and counting and prevent any attempts by opposition to derail the process. She wanted voters in Puducherry and Kerala also to vote for the party.</text>

The video, produced by Chennai-based Put Chutney and Mumbai startup Culture Machine, has got 1,543 views on YouTube and 200-plus retweets. "We made the video in one single shot to signify that elections are our one shot at democracy. It is the one place where we can actually register a protest or make a difference. Unhappy with all candidates in the fray? Press NOTA," says Ashraf.</text>

	<text>TRICHY: DMK women's wing secretary and Rajya Sabha member Kanimozhi on Saturday attacked AIADMK's poll promise of providing free electricity to 78 lakh households in Tamil Nadu and asked why the state government had increased electricity charges twice in the past five years if it could give power free of cost. Speaking to reporters in Trichy on the last day of campaigning for the May 16 assembly election, she said, "The AIADMK government put extra burden on people in terms of electricity bills by increasing the cost. Now, if they say they would give power free of cost, people won't believe it." Similarly, AIADMK's promise of achieving total prohibition in a phased manner was a myth, she said. "The DMK will bring total prohibition in the state at one go and, after that, focus on rehabilitation of alcoholics," she said. Kanimozhi said AIADMK would not come back to power despite bribing voters with money as people "want to get rid of the incumbent government."</text>

	<text>Muthuvel Karunanidhi, 92, says the DMK represents a self-respect movement and a political culture that values human rights. He believes the people of Tamil Nadu have placed their faith in him for 60 years "and they are sure that I will fulfil what I say." In an exclusive interview to TOI, he said the allegations of corruption against him by "a person", who had been punished by a court and made to resign twice as CM, had no moral backing. You belong to a rare breed of leaders who has been elected chief minister five times and are now aiming to become CM for the sixth time. You've been campaigning extensively across the state in a van at this age. What keeps you going, what are you keen to achieve this time? It is my focus on continuous service to Tamil, Tamils and Tamil Nadu. I never get tired because these three fully occupy my mind. I will not cease to work till I see the full advancement of Tamil, good prosperity of Tamils and remarkable growth of Tamil Nadu. TN politics used to be personality-driven, with voters swayed by personalities at the helm. But today, there is a deeper shift; issues such as development, welfare, prohibition, corruption are dominating. Do you think we in TN are at the threshold of an era in which the opposition will play a significant role? I am always of the view that dissent is the essence of democracy. Democracy will not flourish without the significant role of the opposition. Unlike AIADMK, we respect opposition parties, allow them to have their view and take into account their viewpoints. The state has a political culture of vendetta. Rival leaders do not meet or see eye to eye in the assembly. Will you try to bring about a change if you win and give opposition leaders their due? We stand for mutual political culture. Ours is a self-respect movement. While we are maintaining our self-respect without allowing it to be hurt by anyone, we always honour the self-respect of others. We have a very deep faith in human rights. As you know, political culture is not a one-way traffic. All the parties should have equal commitment to political culture. Sale of liquor remains a major source of income for the state exchequer. If you win and bring in total prohibition at one stroke, how would you implement the expensive welfare schemes envisaged in your electoral manifesto and where would you get the money from? Sources of revenue to implement schemes enumerated in the DMK manifesto in the absence of liquor income have been indicated in the manifesto. Please see page 59 of the manifesto (To stop malpractices in mining and generate more employment opportunities, the DMK manifesto proposes a PPP model to employ two lakh youth. Each PPP unit would be involved in mining or trading of sand, granite and rare earth minerals. The youth would invest an amount not less than Rs 50,000 each in a unit and government would provide a matching share from a corpus of Rs 1,000 crore.) While there is talk of prohibition of liquor as a solution to social evils, many underlying problems remain unaddressed like unemployment, gender bias, and social tensions. Why is that? I have, a number of times, explained that DMK is not merely a political party, it is also a social movement. We have always been tackling social evils. To solve the problem of unemployment to a great extent, we have indicated a number of schemes in our manifesto. You know, we have always been against gender bias. Our constructive stand on social tensions is well-known. During her campaign, Jayalalithaa called you the father-figure of a clan steeped in corruption and the leader of a party which is corrupt. Do you think your personal appeal remains high despite the AIADMK supremo repeatedly targeting you? Whoever targets me, people of Tamil Nadu will always listen to me as they have been doing for the last 60 years and they are sure that I will fulfil what I say. Before making any promise, I think a number of times ... my words come from the depth of my heart and hence they are sincere and honest. A person, who has been punished by the special court to undergo imprisonment for four years and to pay a fine of hundred crores of rupees in the disproportionate assets case and who had to twice resign and go out of the office of the chief minister as her holding the office was unconstitutional, has no moral backing to find fault with me. DMK was founded in Chennai and the city remained one of its bastions for a long time, even during the MGR years. But AIADMK has gained ground in your citadel with 2, 7 and 11 seats in the last three polls respectively. Why did this happen? Gaining ground or losing ground in a particular centre is not a permanent feature for any political party, as people's preferences change from time to time. Ultimately the reason lies with the people. In this multi-cornered contest, what do you think are your party's strengths? Our party's prospects are brighter for the simple reason that there is a silent anti-incumbency mood, which will go largely in favour of the DMK and that other opposition parties will eat into the vote-bank of AIADMK and the DMK is forging ahead as the next ruling party. The vote share of DMK has remained stagnant and not increased since 2006. Poll statistics suggest that you haven't made inroads beyond a traditional base. The vote share which was 30.92% in 2001, fell to 26.46% in 2006 and 22.39% in 2011. Why was that? As I said earlier, the vote share of a party is not a constant factor. This time our vote share will go up considerably. It will certainly cross 2001 mark. This is the first election in a long time that most small parties preferred to maintain a distance from DMK before the polls. There are many reasons cited for DMK not being able to strike a pre-poll seat-sharing arrangement with them. Did it happen because they demanded more seats or was it because DMK's hold was perceived to be weakening? Both reasons are incorrect. Most small parties did not fall in line for various personal reasons. DMK has been reiterating its stand that it is not in favour of a coalition government. But what if DMK falls short of numbers to form a government on its own? Which are the parties which you think may be willing to align with you in a postpoll arrangement? I don't want to answer a presumptive question. We will get a very comfortable majority of seats. In your previous tenure, there were allegations that your family members were interfering in the functioning of the government. How do you intend to deal with this problem if DMK is elected to power this time? The allegations are artificial. I have a family and I have been affectionate to my family members. My party is greater and nobler than my family. I have never allowed my family to interfere with my party or with the functioning of the government. My family members have their own pursuits and they grow according to their individual efficiency and hard work in which I have no say. In a recent interview, you said that in politics nothing moves within a set time frame. The dynamics of the past, present and future decide everything. Has your party kept pace with the social changes the state has seen in the last decade? The DMK has always been keeping pace with social change. The DMK is resilient.</text>

	<text>COIMBATORE: A flying squad in Tiruppur district of election-bound Tamil Nadu detained three trucks carrying cash worth Rs 570 crore in the early hours of Saturday. Election officials said the cash belonged to the State Bank of India (SBI). The trucks were going from Coimbatore to Visakhapatnam when they were intercepted by the flying squad on the Perumanallur- Kunnathur road. The three trucks were escorted by Andhra Pradesh police personnel who were in plain clothes. The drivers of the trucks didn't stop the vehicles when the flying tried to stop them. The flying squad chased the vehicles and intercepted them. Police personnel and SBI officials, who were accompanying the trucks, could not produce valid documents and so the vehicles were taken to Tiruppur collectorate. CRPF personnel were deployed at the district collectorate to guard the cash-laden trucks. When contacted, Tiruppur collector S Jayanthi said a committee had been formed to sort out the issue. "There are some issues in connection with the seizure. The committee comprising RBI officials, income tax officials and SBI officials will take a decision," she said.

	<text>NEW DELHI: The newly elected president of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena will be visiting India on February 16. This visit is significant for both the countries. Sirisena has indicated on the day of ascension to office that his maiden foreign visit would be to India. Days after winning the historic Presidential elections, he dispatched his new foreign minister Mangala Samaraweera to New Delhi with a clear message that the new Sri Lankan dispensation looks up to India with hope for strengthening bilateral relations. As close neighbours India and Sri Lanka have enjoyed good relations for decades. Sri Lanka was one of the active participants in Nehru's Non Aligned Movement - NAM diplomacy. Things turned sour in '80s when the ethnic strife started vitiating the atmosphere in the island nation. India had to struggle hard to maintain a balance between its domestic political compulsions and international obligations. In the process it has created enemies and friends on both sides. 2008-09 was a turning point in Sri Lankan history. After months of bloody battles across the Northern Province, the Sri Lankan Army had finally decimated the LTTE, thus bringing to an end 25 years of armed ethnic conflict. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa overnight transformed into a national hero and a cult figure. Rajapaksa decided to use this favourable political climate to advance the Presidential elections. Although his first term as President was to end in November 2010 he went ahead and held the elections in January 2010. Fresh from the success in the war against LTTE, Rajapaksa earned a convincing victory over his rival Gen. Sarath Fonseka by a margin of over 20 lakh votes. Interestingly he also secured a favourable judgment from the country's Supreme Court to begin his Presidential tenure as per schedule in November 2010. Rajapaksa's second term as president was to end in November 2016. He started off the second term with high popularity ratings. However in four years his popularity started dipping. Country's economy too started slipping into a morass. Allegations of corruption, nepotism, centralisation of powers and disaffection in various ethnic and religious communities have surrounded his regime. Realising that waiting till 2016 would further dampen his prospects of re-election he chose to advance the Presidential elections to January 2015. Had he won the elections he would have started his third term in November 2016 and continued as the President till November 2022. But the run up to the elections in January 2015 saw many dramatic developments in the country's politics. One of his closest aides in the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party - SLFP and a Minister in his Cabinet Maithripala Sirisena had suddenly decided to come out and join hands with the Opposition. This was a major blow to the already struggling Rajapaksa's regime. Until then the Opposition was in a lacklustre condition. Sirisena's entry had helped in galvanising the Opposition. Although Rajapaksa's regime gave the Opposition only 30 days to become battle-fit, things moved so swiftly against Rajapaksa that in the end he lost the elections, in a nail biting finish, by around 5 lakh votes.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: India is looking forward to US President Barack Obama's visit to Delhi as the guest of honour at this year's Republic Day parade on January 26. Neither the fact that he is the outgoing president nor that it is his second visit as president dampens the enthusiasm in the Indian establishment. Coming a few months after the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, this visit has understandably been seen by some as India's effort at a balancing act. However it must be kept in mind that Prime Minister Modi's foreign policy approach is nonconventional. He has freed Indian diplomacy from romantic slogan-mongering and embarked on a pragmatic 'India's interest' path. Even when he is on a multilateral mission his focus is on bilateralism with 'India's interest' as the benchmark. Thus for him, the visit of the Chinese president and the forthcoming visit of the US president are, far from being a balancing act, two independent events that have great bearing on India's diplomatic objectives. READ ALSO: Unprecedented seven-layer security ring for Obama's India visit US-India relations have seen many ups and downs. When Prime Minister Modi took over many skeptics thought that the relationship would go from bad to worse because of the visa related acrimony between the two in the last one decade. But Prime Minister Modi displayed great statesmanship by leaving behind all the personal insults and ill-will and embarking on a major charm offensive. As an astute politician he used his visit to the US in September last to attend the United Nations General Assembly to set bilateral relations on a different course. He spent just 24 hours in Washington DC. But in that short visit he was able to achieve so much, the most important being the demolition of the skepticism and creation of confidence. President Obama too responded positively to the overtures thus laying a firm foundation for a redefined relationship. READ ALSO: US asks for a no-fly zone over Rajpath on R-Day, India says no Agencies in overdrive for Obama's R-Day security India and US are the world's most populous and successful democracies. Both share several political, ethical and moral values. Thus the two are seen by many as natural allies. India's four million strong diaspora population is a binding factor between the two countries. Both have benefited in all these years whenever the relations were cordial. Both have suffered due to misunderstandings and consequent strain in relationship too. The joint statement issued by both the leaders during PM Modi's visit to Washington DC comprehensively outlined the agenda for cooperation and development. It described the new initiative as a "long-term vision for a resilient and ambitious partnership" and "guiding framework" for the people and the government. The joint statement aptly underscored that 'prosperity and security' are the expected end result of the strategic partnership between the two countries. On his part, Prime Minister Modi was categorical in emphasizing that India accords 'priority' to its partnership with the United States in order to 'realize India's rise as a responsible, influential world power'.</text>

	<text>ALEPPO/HMEIMIM AIRBASE (Syria): A 48-hour ceasefire took hold Thursday in Syria's battered second city of Aleppo after President Bashar al-Assad's and rebel forces gave in to mounting diplomatic pressure. Relieved residents returned to the streets after two weeks of heavy fighting in the divided metropolis, a key battleground in Syria's five-year civil war. The Syrian army said late on Wednesday that it had agreed to calls from Russia and the United States for a two-day truce in Aleppo that would begin from 1am on Thursday. The agreement followed an intense diplomatic push by Moscow and Washington  the co-sponsors of a February 27 ceasefire agreement that had begun to fall apart  to salvage peace efforts. Renewed fighting in recent days, especially in and around Aleppo, had threatened the full collapse of the ceasefire, a landmark in attempts to finally resolve a conflict that has left more than 270,000 dead. More than 280 civilians were reported killed since April 22 in the clashes in Aleppo, with regime air strikes pounding the opposition-held east while rebels fired a barrage of rockets into the government-controlled west. Early on Thursday, an AFP correspondent in the city said there had been no signs of fresh air raids since the ceasefire took effect. As residents emerged, shopkeepers were reopening their doors while fruit and vegetable markets  one of which was struck in an April 24 raid that left 12 dead  were again up and running. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, confirmed there had been no bombing in the city, though it said a civilian had died in a western district from rebel shelling that came minutes after the ceasefire took effect. After a whirlwind of talks involving diplomats from top world powers and the United Nations, US secretary of state John Kerry announced the truce had taken effect and that violence had already fallen off. "We've seen an overall decrease in violence in those areas even though there are some reports of continued fighting in some locations," Kerry said. He said US officials in Geneva were coordinating with their Russian colleagues on "enhanced monitoring efforts for this renewed cessation". The Russian defence ministry said its ceasefire monitors had agreed with their US counterparts to oversee this truce until midnight on May 6. In Aleppo, the head of the local branch of the powerful Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) rebel force, Ahmad Sanada, said the group would respect the ceasefire. "We are in favour of any initiative that relieves the suffering of civilians and avoids bloodshed and we will respect" the ceasefire, he told AFP. Diplomats are hoping a nationwide ceasefire can underpin efforts to resolve Syria's war, which evolved from a crackdown on anti-government protests into a devastating multi-front conflict. UN-backed peace talks in Geneva, which mediators hope can resume later this month, have so far made little headway, with the government rejecting the opposition's demand that Assad step aside as part of a political transition. The conflict led in part to the emergence of the jihadist Islamic State (ISIS) group, which has seized control of large areas of Syria and neighbouring Iraq. On Thursday, twin bombings in central Syria killed at least 10 civilians and wounded 40 more, the observatory said, amid recent fighting in the area between ISIS fighters and regime troops. State television reported that at least six people were killed and 28 seriously wounded in the suicide attack and car bombing in a square in Mukharram al-Fawqani in Homs province. The area, controlled by the government, is located between the cities of Homs and Palmyra, which was recaptured by the Syrian army from jihadists last month. The blasts came just days after ISIS seized the nearby Shaer gas field, one of the biggest in Homs, in an attack that killed at least 16 government troops. There was no immediate claim of responsiblity for Thursday's attacks but suicide and car bombings are a favourite tactic of ISIS jihadists. Western powers are hoping that ending the fighting in other parts of Syria will help focus efforts against ISIS, which a US-led coalition has been targeting with air strikes in Syria and Iraq since mid-2014. Syrian officials have insisted they are targeting jihadists in Aleppo not covered by the ceasefire, in particular members of the al-Qaida affiliated al-Nusra Front, which is fighting in the city alongside other rebel groups. At an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Aleppo Wednesday, Syria's deputy UN ambassador Mounzer Mounzer defended the regime's actions in the city. "What the Syrian government has been doing in the city of Aleppo is merely the fulfilment of its obligations to protect its citizens from terrorism," he told the council.</text>

	<text>CAIRO: An Egyptian government official has blamed the animated "Tom and Jerry" series for allegedly spreading a culture of violence. The accusations by Salah Abdel-Sadek, head of State Information Service, which is affiliated with the presidency, came at a forum held in Cairo this week. Abdel-Sadek told academics, media specialists, and public figures who had gathered to discuss violence that video games and cartoons are to blame. He said children see Tom Cat and Jerry Mouse "beat and blow up with explosives" one another and "in their minds, they see this as normal." The remarks are starkly at odds with the political reality of Egypt. The Mideast country is struggling with a home-grown Islamic insurgency and regularly sees heavy-handed security measures used against protesters. Thousands of political dissidents are imprisoned.</text>

	<text>TEHRAN: Iran test-fired another ballistic missile, the latest in a spate of tests following the implementation of the nuclear deal with world powers earlier this year, according to a report on Monday by the country's semi-official Tasnim news agency. The test-firing of the missile was carried out two weeks ago, the agency quoted General Ali Abdollahi, deputy chief of the armed forces' headquarters, as saying. Tasnim is close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, which is in charge of Iranian ballistic missiles program. The agency said the missile has a range of 2,000 kilometres, or 1,250 miles, enough to reach much of the Middle East. Iranian military commanders have described them as a strategic asset and a strong deterrent, capable of hitting US bases or Israel in the event of a strike on Iran. Iran insists the ballistic tests do not violate the nuclear deal and is likely seeking to demonstrate it is making progress with its ballistic program, despite scaling back on the nuclear program following the deal that led to the lifting of international sanction on Tehran. Abdollahi said the latest missile tested is very accurate, within eight metres. "Eight metres means nothing, it means it's without any error," he said. He did not elaborate. Last month, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, chief of the Guard's airspace division, said a new, upgraded version of the Sajjil, a solid fuel high-speed missile with a range of 1,200 miles that was first tested in 2008, would soon be ready. But it was not immediately clear if the missile Abdollahi referred to was the new Sajjil. In March, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles, one emblazoned with the phrase "Israel must be wiped out" in Hebrew, that set off an international outcry. The landmark deal does not include provisions against missile launches and when it came into effect on January 16, the Security Council lifted most UN sanctions against Tehran, including a ban it had imposed in 2010 on Iran testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. To deal with the restrictions in the nuclear agreement, the council adopted a resolution last July, which only "calls on" Iran not to carry out such tests.</text>

	<text>TEHRAN: Iranian pilgrims will not be traveling to Saudi Arabia this year for the annual hajj pilgrimage because security conditions in the Sunni kingdom are inadequate, says an Iranian government minister. Ali Jannati, the country's minister of culture and Islamic guidance, said on Thursday that Tehran has been trying to "resolve the issue" with Riyadh for four months without progress and "now we've lost time." The kingdom severed ties with Tehran after its diplomatic missions were attacked and ransacked in Iran after the Saudis executed a top Shiite cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr on terror charges. Iran says at least 464 Iranian pilgrims were killed in the stampede at the hajj last September and blames Saudi "incompetence" for the deaths.</text>

	<text>DUBAI: It was January 2016 and oil prices had crashed to their lowest in more than a decade. Saudi Arabia's health minister, Khalid al-Falih, a favourite to take over the oil ministry from his mentor Ali al-Naimi, was not panicking. Falih told an audience of oil executives, bankers and policymakers at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world's top oil exporter might benefit from oil below $30 per barrel. It could help to speed up reform and restructure the economy, and move Saudi Arabia to a smaller and more effective government and unleash its private sector, he said. For decades Saudi Arabia, a de facto leader of OPEC, had targeted certain oil price levels. If it did not like the price, it would try to orchestrate a production cut or increase together with its fellow OPEC members. Things were different this time. For the first time in decades, output cuts were not on the agenda to fix the growing global glut that Saudi Arabia helped create by ramping up supply to drive higher-cost producers such as US shale firms out of the market. Also for the first time in decades, a royal rather than a non-royal - Deputy Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman - had been appointed a few month earlier to oversee Saudi oil policies and drive the massive change. Do you not think Prince Mohammed, who is just 30, is doing it all a bit too fast for the generally conservative Saudi society, Falih was asked. "The Royal Highness is very ambitious where he wants Saudi Arabia to be sooner rather later. I can assure you that everybody who works around him is very excited by his vision and energized by his energy," Falih told the audience. "Some people were concerned that we were too slow in the past.. As a former runner, I can tell you that it helps to go through sprints at times to develop your muscular strengths. We are accelerating reform." The writing was on the wall, said the executives leaving the Davos conference. Falih would soon become oil minister reporting to Prince Mohammed, who is quickly turning into the world's most powerful oil figure. Three months later, Prince Mohammed had a chance to showcase his might when he effectively ordered the Saudi delegation led by Naimi not to agree to a global production freeze deal with OPEC and non-OPEC Russia. Fellow OPEC members accused Naimi, who initially said he liked the deal, of no longer speaking with the voice of authority. Three weeks later on Saturday, Naimi was gone and Falih became energy minister. "It is an end of an era when Naimi fought hard and struggled to create a price environment which would have been good for both consumers and producers," said Gary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of New York-based consultancy PIRA. "We are moving to a new era where OPEC will no longer be managing the market while supply and demand will determine the price. The new Saudi oil leadership believes the market will dictate the price and that means higher volatility. We will see higher highs and lower lows," Ross said. IMPETUS TO REFORM Naimi, born in 1935, had orchestrated several OPEC oil output cuts and increases since taking on the oil minister job in 1995. The former Saudi Aramco's clerk-turned-chairman saw oil priced as low as $9 per barrel during the Asian financial crisis at the end of 1990s, as high as $147 in 2008 and back to $36 several months later after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Rumours about Naimi being finally allowed to retire have been hitting the market periodically in the past four years. But even though the Riyadh-born and US-educated Falih has long been tipped to replace Naimi, his fortunes and career kept zigzagging from Saudi Aramco's chairman to health minister until finally securing the job on Saturday - combining energy, industry and mineral resources in a new super ministry. Falih takes the job in a much better market environment compared to January - oil prices have indeed recovered from their January lows of $27 per barrel to trade at around $45 last week on th prospect that the market has began to rebalance thanks to lower U.S. output. Born in 1960, Falih joined Aramco in 1979, and went to study engineering at Texas A&amp;M University in 1982 on an Aramco sponsorship programme. Falih probably knows every oil chief executive in the world as he was the key negotiator behind a Saudi initiative to jointly develop gas resources with oil majors in early 2000. Over the past year, when Naimi was carefully choosing his words or not commenting at all, Falih has become more vocal about his views that the oil market needs to rebalance through low prices and that the Saudis have the resources to wait. "That doesn't really point to somebody who would invest a lot of time and energy in trying to reconcile different OPEC members," said Richard Mallinson from Energy Aspects. Falih says job creation and economic reforms are top worries for the Saudi government these days, not an obsession with oil price levels. "Those transitions sometimes takes years, sometimes decades. The current low oil prices will give us an impetus to accelerate this," Falih said in Davos in January.</text>

	<text>KABUL: A roadside bomb has killed at least four small children from the same family in the southern Zabul province, an official said on Saturday. Wazir Mohammad Jawadi, a district administrator, said that another child from the same family was wounded in the blast which took place late on Friday. Afghanistan is inundated with mines and other explosives left over from decades of war. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, an official said that Afghan security forces repelled an insurgent attack in the eastern Kunar province, killing 26 militants. Gen. Abdul Habib Sayedkhaili, the provincial police chief, said that a police officer was killed in the fighting, which erupted when hundreds of insurgents tried to overrun Ghazi Abad district headquarters near the border with Pakistan. He said forces had prior intelligence about the attack and were prepared to repel it. "Insurgents were defeated after five hours of intense gun battles by the Afghan security forces," he said, adding that more than 40 militants were wounded in the battle. "If we had not had the support of the local people it would have been very difficult to repel the enemy's attack," he commented.</text>

	<text>BAGHDAD: A car bombing claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group killed at least 52 people at a market in a Shiite area of north BAGHDAD on Wednesday, officials said. The blast, the single deadliest attack in the Iraqi capital this year, comes as the government is locked in a political crisis that some have warned could undermine the fight against IS. The bombing, which hit the Sadr City area at around 10:00 am, also wounded at least 65 people, the officials said. The blast set nearby shops on fire and left debris including the charred, twisted remains of a vehicle in the street. Dozens of angry people gathered at the scene of the bombing, blaming the government for the carnage. "The state is in a conflict over (government positions) and the people are the victims," said a man named Abu Ali, adding: "The politicians are behind the explosion." Abu Muntadhar echoed his anger. "The state is responsible for the bombings that hit civilians," he said. The politicians "should all get out." Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who spearheaded a protest movement demanding a cabinet reshuffle and other reforms, has a huge following in the working class neighbourhood of Sadr City, which was named after his father. IS issued an online statement claiming responsibility for the attack. It said a suicide bomber it identified as "Abu Sulaiman al-Ansari" detonated the explosives-rigged vehicle. IS, which overran large areas in 2014, considers Shiites, who make up the majority of Iraq's population, to be heretics and often targets them with bombings. Iraqi forces have regained significant ground from IS, but the jihadists still control a large part of western Iraq, and are able to carry out frequent bombings in government-held areas. Iraq's legislature has been paralysed by a political crisis over replacing the cabinet that the United States and the UN have warned could undermine the fight against IS. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has sought to replace the cabinet of party-affiliated ministers with a government of technocrats, a move opposed by powerful parties that rely on control of ministries for patronage and funds. Angry demonstrators broke into Baghdad's fortified Green Zone and stormed parliament after lawmakers again failed to approve new ministers last month. While the protesters withdrew the following day, parliament has still yet to hold another session.</text>

	<text>RIYADH: Saudi King Salman replaced his long-serving oil minister on Saturday as part of a major government overhaul which comes as the kingdom grapples with a slump in energy revenues. The revamp follows last month's announcement of an ambitious plan to transform Saudi Arabia's economy to reduce its dependence on oil. Ali al-Naimi, who held the post of oil minister for more than two decades, was one of the most powerful figures within the Opec oil cartel. However, recently his influence appeared to have been curbed by the growing power of Salman's son Prince Mohammed who has taken charge of economic policy. Naimi has been replaced by Khaled al-Falih, previously health minister, who takes the enlarged portfolio of energy, industry and mineral resources, according to a royal decree announced today by state media. Among other changes, a new central bank governor was announced and the ministry of electricity and water was scrapped. Naimi, described by Forbes magazine in 2014 as "the world's most powerful oilman", oversaw a major change in policy towards the end of his tenure as OPEC refused to cut production despite a price plunge. Instead the kingdom focused on protecting its market share and driving out less-competitive players, including US shale producers. Major oil producers failed in Doha to reach an agreement on freezing output last month as Saudi Arabia insisted any deal must include all OPEC members, including rival Iran, which boycotted the talks. Naimi was born in 1935, two years before the first commercial quantities of oil were discovered in the kingdom's east. He obtained a master's degree in geology from Stanford University and then joined the Aramco oil company, according to an official biography. He was a supervisor at an oilfield before rising through a series of management roles to become president of Saudi Aramco in 1983 and oil minister 12 years later. He had kept his post despite two major cabinet shakeups last year under Salman, who acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the decade-long reign of King Abdullah ended. Under his father, Prince Mohammed has emerged as one of Saudi Arabia's most influential figures since being named second in line to the throne last year. The deputy crown prince, who is also defence minister, was the main public figure behind the unveiling last month of a long-term reform programme, dubbed "Vision 2030", to restructure the economy. The plan will see the country create the world's largest sovereign investment fund and sell shares in state energy giant Aramco.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: A Russian woman spy infiltrated ISIS ranks and before being executed passed on key information due to which many jihadists lost their lives, the terror group has claimed. An article titled "Elvira Karaeva -- Agent of the Russian Special Services" in Istok, the Islamic State's Russian- language online magazine, focuses on the woman whom ISIS in the Caucasus accused of being an agent of the Russian intelligence services. Karaeva worked as a spy for four years, during which she secretly passed along information on the jihadi groups in the Caucasus, including locations and photographs of ISIS fighters, Fox News reported citing the article. The article notes that although Karaeva was questioned by ISIS' "investigative authorities," she was able to convince them of her innocence. But when the terror network used a "cunning investigative maneuver," the woman confessed and was later executed by an ISIS member, according to the article. "Elvira the apostate gave information to the Russian special services about our brothers and sisters waging jihad...in the Caucasus Province," the article was quoted as saying. "She shamelessly wormed her way into confidence...and then disclosed their (jihadists) location and contacts, thus making them easy prey for the henchmen of taghut," the article states. "Because of her contemptible actions and close contacts with the FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation), many of our brothers and sisters became martyrs," it said. The woman was summoned for questioning more than once by the "investigating authorities" of the Caliphate, the article said. "But every time she invented stories, twisting the facts. In her conversation with the investigators, she often lied and distorted the true meaning of events. Although our brothers had many valid reasons to detain her, they released her every time, trusting her word," it said. The woman -- whose identity has not been confirmed by Russia -- provided the Kremlin with the location of safe houses, secret bases, and positions of ISIS members, according to the terror network. The article claims the woman was caught on an audio recording speaking about her role with the Russian intelligence services. It also said that she was married to a jihadist, named Abu Muslim, whom she killed by poisoning. The fourth issue of Istok was released May 2 by ISIS's Al-Hayat Media Center and translated by MEMRI's newly-launched Russian Media Studies Project, which released excerpts of the article in English yesterday.</text>

	<text>Dubai: India has advised its natives residing in Kuwait to comply with local residency and visa laws as many expatriates have been arrested for overstaying and other violations. "Some expatriates have been arrested in Kuwait due to overstaying their residence visas and for other violations. Furthermore, there are reports about expatriates holding domestic worker visa being arrested as they were working in construction/private sectors, in violation of residency/visa rules," the Indian Embassy in Kuwait said in a statement. "It is, therefore, incumbent upon all those holding Kuwaiti employment visa not to violate rules and regulations of Kuwait to stay legally in the country," the embassy statement said. The Indian embassy in Kuwait also advised Indians to keep their Civil ID (or Passport) with them for showing the security officials during security checks. According to the embassy, it will continue to issue travel documents (Emergency Certificates) to Indians facing deportation, particularly to those whose passport could not be retrieved from their sponsors. "During the last four months (January - April 2016), a total of 2,220 Emergency Certificates (Travel Documents) were issued by the Indian Embassy to facilitate repatriation of Indian nationals who were in detention in Kuwait. The Embassy would continue to assist Indian nationals overstaying in Kuwait for their repatriation by issuing travel documents (Emergency Certificates)," the statement said. According to the figures released by the Indian embassy last year, Indians living legally in Kuwait has crossed 800,000 mark, the largest expatriate community in the Arab country.</text>

	<text>RIYADH: Saudi King Salman replaced his long-serving oil minister on Saturday as part of a major government overhaul which comes as the kingdom grapples with a slump in energy revenues. The revamp follows last month's announcement of an ambitious plan to transform Saudi Arabia's economy to reduce its dependence on oil. Ali al-Naimi, who held the post of oil minister for more than two decades, was one of the most powerful figures within the OPEC oil cartel. But recently his influence appeared to have been curbed by the growing power of Salman's son Prince Mohammed who has taken charge of economic policy. Naimi has been replaced by Khaled al-Falih, the longtime chief of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, who was previously health minister. Falih takes on the enlarged portfolio of energy, industry and mineral resources, according to a royal decree announced Saturday by state media. From 2009, he was Aramco's president and chief executive officer, in charge of about 60,000 employees at the firm which produces roughly one in every eight barrels of the world's oil supply. There was no immediate word on who will replace Falih as Aramco chairman, but Naimi has been made an adviser to the Royal Court. The government restructuring comes after Saudi Arabia last week unveiled a long-term reform programme dubbed "Vision 2030" to rehaul its economy that has been long-dependent on oil. Among other changes announced Saturday, a new ministry of trade and investment was created while other ministries were merged and the electricity and water ministry was scrapped. A new central bank governor, Ahmad al-Khalifi, was also appointed, and the king decreed the creation of a "general authority for entertainment" and another to promote culture. Naimi, described by Forbes magazine in 2014 as "the world's most powerful oilman", oversaw a major change in policy towards the end of his tenure as OPEC refused to cut production despite a price plunge. Instead the kingdom focused on protecting its market share and driving out less-competitive players, including US shale producers. Major oil producers failed to reach an agreement on freezing output in Doha last month as Saudi Arabia insisted any deal must include all OPEC members, including rival Iran, which boycotted the talks. Naimi was born in 1935, two years before the first commercial quantities of oil were discovered in the kingdom's east. He obtained a master's degree in geology from Stanford University and then joined Aramco, according to an official biography. He was a supervisor at an oilfield before rising through a series of management roles to become president of Saudi Aramco in 1983 and oil minister 12 years later. He had kept his post despite two major cabinet shakeups last year under Salman, who acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the decade-long reign of King Abdullah ended. According to an official biography, Falih, whose date of birth was not given, in 1982 earned a mechanical engineering degree from Texas A&amp;M University in the United States. In 1991 he graduated with an MBA from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in his homeland. The ambitious plan to diversify the economy away from oil was announced late last month by Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The deputy crown prince, who is also defence minister, has emerged as one of Saudi Arabia's most influential figures since being named second-in-line to the throne last year. At the root of the long-term reform programme is the sale of less than five percent of Saudi Aramco in what officials say will be the largest-ever Initial Public Offering. For decades, Saudi Arabia, the largest economy in the Arab world, enjoyed a windfall from its massive and easily exploitable oil reserves. Flush with oil revenues, the nation built up enormous fiscal reserves and provided its 21 million citizens with a generous system of public employment, welfare benefits and subsidised utilities. But analysts have long warned that the Saudi system, which counted on oil for 73 percent of state revenues last year, is deeply bureaucratic and inefficient. Riyadh posted a record budget deficit in 2015 and a $87-billion shortfall is projected for this year.</text>

	<text>JERUSALEM: Israel's military says it has struck Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip in response to rocket fire toward Israel. The military says sirens wailed in southern Israel early Saturday, warning of an incoming rocket. One landed in an open field, causing no injuries. The military says it retaliated against the territory's Hamas rulers. Gaza militants have fired mortar rounds at Israel over the past three days, prompting Israeli retaliation. Palestinian attacks intensified after Israel uncovered an attack tunnel Thursday beneath the border. Hamas used tunnels to attack Israel during the 50-day Gaza war in 2014 and fired thousands of rockets. The recent exchanges of fire are among the most serious since the war ended.</text>

	<text>BAGHDAD: Iraqi forces retook a northern village from Islamic State on Monday, supported by artillery and air strikes from a US-led coalition, as they try to close in on the city of Mosul. In March, Iraq's military opened a new front against the militants in the Makhmour area, which it called the first phase of a wider campaign to liberate Mosul, around 60km further north. But progress has been slow, and to date Iraqi forces have taken just five villages. "In a swift operation, our units took the groups of the terrorist organization Daesh by surprise and entered the village," read a statement from the Nineveh Operations Command, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. A source involved in the operation said the militants put up little resistance in the village of Kabrouk. The advance brings Iraqi forces slightly closer to the oil town of Qayyara on the western banks of the Tigris River, control of that would help to isolate Mosul from territory the militants hold further south and east. An air base about 16km west of the river that US forces used following the 2003 invasion could serve as a staging ground for the Mosul offensive. Kurdish peshmerga forces and a range of militia groups may take part. The offensive's faltering start has cast renewed doubt on the capabilities of the Iraqi army, which retreated in disarray when Islamic State seized Mosul in 2014. Nineveh Operations Commander Major General Najm al-Jabouri blamed the slow pace on a lack of troops. "If it weren't for the limited units, we could have advanced further, but we don't have forces to hold ground," he told Reuters in a recent interview. His forces had no tanks and were fighting without the elite counter-terrorism forces that have spearheaded most of Iraq's successful offensives elsewhere, Jabouri said. Islamic State's use of civilians as human shields has also hampered Iraqi forces. US Army Colonel Steve Warren, a spokesman for the US-led coalition, said more troops would be deployed to Makhmour and that "tens of thousands" were needed for the final push on Mosul. "We knew that the fighting would get harder the further north we went and we are seeing that to be the case," he told Reuters. Iraqi officials say they will retake Mosul in 2016. But in private many question whether or not that is possible. The pace of fighting could slow further as temperatures continue to rise and the month-long Ramadan season begins in early June.</text>

	<text>Jail inmates are fast emerging as the new labour workforce for India's private sector. Is it corporate opportunism, penal reform, or a bit of both? In the 21st century marketplace that makes much of the backstory of a product, here's a twist: the football, floor tile, shampoo, or car you own could have featured a prisoner in the workforce. The Indian prison industry  manufacturing for the state or making prison-branded goods so far  has lately started working for the private sector. From The Himalaya Drug Company and automotive component manufacturer Spark Minda Corporation, to small manufacturers in Meerut in UP and Yamunanagar in Haryana, the private sector has started outsourcing  or in prison parlance, 'in-sourcing'  jobs to jails. Himalaya's supply chain for alfalfa, a medicinal plant that it uses in several health products, can be traced to a prison farming programme established five years ago in Karnataka Open Air Jail, Bengaluru. It was later extended to three prisons in Andhra Pradesh and two in Goa. "Forty-five percent of our Alfalfa requirement is sourced through contract farming, of which about 3% comes from the Prison Farming Programme," says Himalaya CEO Philipe Haydon. "Our goal is to source the entire alfalfa requirement from this programme." Three months ago, 20 prisoners in Colvale Central Jail, North Goa were trained by the pharma's field staff in farming and harvesting. They're paid the state's daily prison wage of Rs 120 for skilled labour (Rs 80 for semi-skilled work). Himalaya provides the seeds and manure, and buys back the harvest, which varies from 6.5 to 8 metric tons per prison annually, at an undisclosed price. "Now that we're earning some revenue, we plan to expand such partnerships and scale up wages," says Elvis Gomes, Goa's IG, prisons. And so 10,000 square metres in Colvale and Sada Sub Jail have been set aside for the project. Late last year, 30 inmates at Pune's Yerwada Central Jail were recruited by Spark Minda, which started an assembly unit for automotive wiring harnesses there, after its successful operation in Tihar the year before. "We borrowed the idea from our counterparts in Germany who employed prisoners," says N K Taneja, Group Chief Marketing Officer. The company currently employs 80 inmates across both correctional facilities, but believes there's room for at least 200. "Before we got into this partnership, we ran it by our clients, Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra who approved of the initiative," he says. For optimal results from their two-month training, Spark Minda only hires convicts in for the long haul  five years and more. While all prisoners get a certificate of work, Yerwada's inmates earn Rs 200 a day, part of which goes to the prisoners' welfare fund and the institution itself, and Tihar's get the standard wage of Rs 110. Tihar also earns a separate monthly rent of Rs 12/sq ft from Spark Minda for use of their premises. Meanwhile, in Yamunanagar District Jail, 200km from Gurgaon, two dozen inmates produce ceramic floor tiles for a local firm. "They work six to eight hours a day for Rs 40," says IG Jagjeet Singh, adding that Ambala Central Jail produces steel furniture for another company. Indian prison officials speak glowingly of the PPP model  also interpreted as the Private Prison Partnership  saying its income offsets costs. (In 2014-15, the 88,221 inmates lodged in UP prisons cost the state Rs 74 lakh.) But the model also assists in rehabilitation by skilling prisoners for life beyond bars. And finally, as per prison wisdom, a 'busy convict is an easy convict'. Prison brass say convicts are never pressed into work, although they may be nudged. "We first select people who know the work, then bring in those interested but unskilled," explains DIG prisons, Telangana, VK Singh. The assembly of electric metre boxes for Hyderabad-based Linkwell Telesystems, and steel furniture for SS Industries are in-sourced to the central and open prisons in Cherlapalli. "We vet companies for security risks, potential environmental pollution, risk to prisoners' health, their business plans, and other factors. We have valuable land and we don't want firms that only wish to take advantage of our real estate," Singh maintains. Not to mention captive labour. The prison-industrial complex worldwide has been under greater scrutiny in recent years. Contracting companies in China and America have been condemned for their exploitative prisoner wages (as low as 2 cents an hour)  and for profiting off the taxpayer, as prisons are usually state funded. Moreover, companies don't have to worry about absenteeism or health benefits and pension. Nikhil Roy, programme development officer at the London-based Penal Reform International, believes there's nothing wrong with the profit motive. "It's the exploitation of prisoners that we need to guard against. Hence, the Mandela Rules (the UN's recently revised standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners) do not rule out profit but make it clear this should not be "subordinate" to the welfare of the prisoners," Roy says on email. The conservative view has long argued that prisoners don't deserve market minimum wages because the state sponsors their bed and board anyway. Also, their crime or alleged crime denies them equal wage rights. So income, however paltry, ought to be regarded as a bonus. But the reformist view is that even prisoners have families to support outside, and a decent income earned in incarceration will not only help their kin, but also give them a sense of purpose and dignity. (In some cases in Tihar, 25% of the convict's income is remitted to the family of his victim). But even though companies are less wary of their association with prisons today, calling it their CSR, jail authorities know they still have to tread lightly. "If we strike too hard a bargain on remuneration, companies will stay away," points out VK Singh. Kiran Bedi, former IG prisons, Tihar is credited with planting the PPP model in Delhi prisons in the '90s. "Today prison reform is a movement and big companies want their association with it to be visible; earlier they kept a low profile because it could have been be construed as forced work," she says. Signs of changing times are evident from the number of jails being roped in. While Spark Minda plans to set up a unit in Nagpur as well, Himalaya is scoping out Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Bedi, for one, is upbeat. "I am glad companies are coming in and skilling prisoners at a low cost. Entering a prison is not risk-free, and yet they come here instead of employing elsewhere. I look at it as the glass half full."</text>

	<text>Shah Shuja Durrani's autobiography is clear on how Ranjit Singh tortured his son to make him give up the diamond, writes William Dalrymple Earlier this month Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar told the Supreme Court that the Kohinoor was given freely to the British in the mid-19th century by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, and had been "neither stolen nor forcibly taken by British rulers". This was by any standards a strikingly unhistorical statement, all the odder because the facts of the case are not really in dispute. In truth, Ranjit Singh jealously guarded both his kingdom and his state jewels, and spent much of his adult life successfully keeping both from the grasping appetites of the militarised East India Company. By forming an alliance with the Company, but maintaining the most magnificent and up-to-date indigenous army of its day, he made sure that no Briton could enter the lands of the Khalsa without an invitation. Distinguished visitors like Emily Eden were allowed to see the Maharajah wearing the great jewel on his arm during state banquets, but when he died, he left the Kohinoor in his will not to the Company, nor to the British, nor even to Queen Victoria, but to the Jagannath temple at Puri. The British got their hands on the jewel only a decade later, after taking advantage of the Sikh divisions and general anarchy which engulfed the Punjab following Ranjit's death. They finally defeated the Khalsa during a series of notably bloody battles in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849. On March 29, 1849, the Kingdom of the Punjab was formally annexed by the Company, and the Last Treaty of Lahore was signed, officially ceding the Kohinoor to the Queen and the Maharaja's other assets to the Company. Article III of the treaty read: "The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja ool-Moolk by Maharajah Runjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England." On December 7, 1849, in the presence of the Board of Administration for the affairs of the Punjab, Duleep Singh, the ten-year-old son of Ranjit Singh, was compelled to hand over the great diamond. File photo of William Dalrymple. So who should now own the Kohinoor? The case is often made in India that as the Kohinoor was taken by the British at the point of a bayonet, the British must therefore give it back. Yet the reality is more muddy. While the Kohinoor certainly originated in India, most probably in the Kollur mines of Golconda, Persia, Afghanistan and Pakistan also have good claims on the jewel, as it was owned at different times by Nadir Shah of Persia, Ahmed Shah Durrani of Afghanistan, and Ranjit Singh of Lahore. All three countries have at different times claimed the jewel and issued legal action in attempt to get it back. Moreover, as the third article of the Treaty of Lahore hints, Ranjit Singh also took the jewel by force, just as the British did. In the same way that British sources tend to gloss over the violence inherent in their seizure of the stone, so Sikh ones do likewise. Yet the autobiography of its previous owner Shah Shuja Durrani, which I found in Kabul when I was working on my last book, Return of a King, is explicit about what happened. On arrival in Lahore, to which he had been invited by Ranjit on his fall from power, Shuja was separated from his harem, put under house arrest and told to hand over the diamond: "The ladies of our harem were accommodated in another mansion, to which we had, most vexatiously, no access," wrote Shuja in his Memoirs. "Food and water rations were reduced or arbitrarily cut off." Slowly, Ranjit increased the pressure. At the lowest ebb of his fortunes, Shuja was put in a cage, and according to his own account, his eldest son, Timur Shah, was tortured in front of him until he agreed to part with his most valuable possession. On June , 1813, Ranjit Singh was received by Shuja "with much dignity, and both being seated, a solemn silence ensued for nearly an hour. Ranjit then, getting impatient, whispered to one of his attendants to remind the Shah of the object of his coming. No answer was returned, but the Shah with his eyes made a signal to a eunuch, who retired, and brought in a small roll, which he set down on the carpet at an equal distance between the chiefs. Ranjit Singh desired his eunuch to unfold the roll, and when the diamond was recognized, the Sikh immediately retired with his prize in his hand." India's greatest diamonds  the Darya Nur, the Hope diamond, the Noor al-Ayn, the Orlov and Pitt-Regent diamond  all have exceptionally blood histories, with long litanies of betrayals, blindings, thefts, torture, assassination and murder associated with them. My personal view is that looking into the distant past, and attempting to right wrongs with claims for compensation and restitution, while understandable, is little more than a recipe for conflict and division. History everywhere is full of horrors and where should the accounts stop? Should the British sue Norway for Viking raids and Italy for the gold looted by the Romans? Should the Sri Lankan governments sue India for the destruction of the cities of Polonnoruwa and Anuradhapura by the Cholas in 993, when they invaded Sri Lanka, sacked all the towns, plundered the stupas and destroyed all the temples? According the Culavamsa chronicle: The Cholas violently destroyed here and there all the monasteries, Like blood-sucking yakkhas they took all the treasures of Lanka. They took away all valuables in the treasure house of the King, They plundered what there was to plunder in vihara and the town. The golden image of the Master [Buddha], The two jewels which had been set as eyes in the Prince of Sages, All these they took. They deprived the Island of Lanka of her valuables, Leaving the splendid town in a state as if it had been plundered by yakkhas. Rather than lawsuits, I think money and time would be better spent on proper education in history for all concerned. History is more complex and muddled than most people realise. How many Indians are aware, for example, of the bloody punitive raids the Chola navy made on the cities of Java and Indonesia when the coastal ports were looted and burned down? The British in particular need to learn what they did to pre-Colonial peoples across the world. For the same empire which led to the huge enrichment of Britain, conversely, led to the impoverishment of much of the rest of the non-European world. India and China, which until then had dominated global manufacturing, were two of the biggest losers in this story, along with hundreds of thousands of enslaved sub-Saharan Africans sent off to work in the Plantations. Yet, astonishingly, most British people are by and large completely unaware of the many horrors of their imperial history as it does not appear on any history curriculum taught in British schools. We cannot change what has happened in the past, but we can try to understand and to learn from past errors and to make sure the worst of them are not repeated. For as Edmund Burke, the greatest scourge of the East India Company rightly put it, "those who fail to learn from history are destined always to repeat it."

	<text>Indian entrepreneurs who borrowed cheap are now finding out that defaulting could land them in prison For non-resident Indians in the Gulf, borrowing from local lenders at cheap rates was a breeze compared to the running around needed for a loan back home. But now as they risk default, many are discovering that repercussions are far more severe  a criminal tag and prospects of imprisonment. The trigger for the debt crisis among borrowers, predominantly traders, has been a move by banks to pull back on credit. This comes in the wake of the liquidity shortfall, following the crash in oil prices and concerns of credit quality. Prince Alex, a food trader in Dubai's Al Ras market who has been based there for ten years, fled the country recently fearing arrest. He was unable to repay loans after banks cut his credit limit by 50% at short notice in June 2015. "Banks, which were once encouraging us to take several million dirhams in loans by providing a single security cheque, suddenly put pressure on us to repay. They did not allow us to open a new letter of credit while closing existing ones. If I had stayed in Dubai, I would have been arrested when cheques bounced. My consultants are negotiating with banks to restructure the loans," he said. As UAE does not have bankruptcy laws defaulters often end up behind bars. Like 'Atlas' Ramachandran, 74, a leading jewellery chain owner from Kerala, who once figured on a list of the 100 most powerful people in the Gulf countries. A big-time borrower in UAE, Ramachandran is now behind bars in Dubai after cheques for 34 million dirhams (Rs 62 crore) issued by his group to various banks bounced. He owned 35 jewellery outlets, including 19 in UAE. Banks in the country are estimated to have $1.5 billion in non-performing assets in the last year. Bank of Baroda, the only Indian entity authorized to carry out full retail banking operations in the UAE, has non-performing assets of over 1 billion dirhams (Rs 1,900 crore) as on December 31, 2015. Given the severity of the punishment in UAE, some NRI traders have raised funds in India to tide over the crisis in Dubai. Chennai-based real estate firm Arun Excello's MD P Suresh said one of his customers sought help to liquidate assets and raise Rs 18 crore at short notice to avoid arrest on account of cheque-bouncing. "We helped him meet his payment commitments," said Suresh. Banks that were once throwing money at borrowers have turned cautious and are now calling back loans. "This is a wakeup call for banks. It is time we brought financial discipline into the system to prevent similar defrauding in future. Not more than 50% of businesses keep proper books of accounts here," said James Mathew, MD of Crowe Horwath, an auditing firm. Some who left UAE after defrauding banks have been tracked to India, but many of them are well-connected and have been spared prosecution. Borrowers are not blameless. "In Dubai, people used to buy things they don't need, with money they don't have to impress people they don't know," said a trader, putting his own spin on a famous quote. Many raised money using shell companies and fake balance sheets. Promoters of many such fraudulent firms subsequently shut down and fled the country. "While a firm in India gets a credit limit of roughly 20% of its annual turnover against securitization of assets, banks in Dubai were quite liberal, offering up to 500% of turnover as loan. There was no security requirement for loans, and if a leading bank gave a loan of 10 million dirhams (roughly Rs 18 crore) to a trader, there were at least five others willing to give 5-10 million dirhams each, all against a single cheque," said a financial consultant in Dubai. Besides the fall in oil prices the UAE's decision to introduce value added tax on January 1, 2018 (in line with World Bank recommendations) could be a trigger for closer scrutiny of balance sheets. About 60% of banks have now stopped lending to SMEs. While defaulters are from all nationalities, going by the sheer population of Indians in the region, they account for a significant share.</text>

	<text>Movies to Mahabharata, he's analysed them all S Anand's passion for computing drove his Chemical Engineering professors to distraction at IIT Madras, and when he moved on to IIM Bangalore, after a brief stint at IBM India, he was nicknamed "Stud" and alternatively, "Prof"  which as any alumnus will tell you  is one of the highest forms of praise that can be given to a batchmate. After graduating from IIM B, Anand moved on to jobs at the Boston Consulting Group and Infosys Consulting. In 2012, he was infected by the startup virus, and became chief data scientist at Gramener, which specializes in data visualization. Anand lives in Bangalore, where he uses text analytics to uncover the fact that it is Yudhishthira who is at the centre of Mahabaratha's plot, and not Arjuna, as one would imagine. Oh, and he also uses data science to understand his mobile bill. On becoming a data scientist ... It was an accidental mix of three of my personal interests  programming, statistics and design. It wasn't until 2009 that the term "data science" was coined. Until then, I knew I wanted a career that combined all three of my passions. Once I knew it had a name, the decision was obvious. What's the kind of work you do at Gramener? We're short circuiting the gap between gathering data and understanding data. We're work with all kinds of data. We work with aircraft flight paths, call data, court case results, fielding performances, poll forecasts, TV serial transcripts, even sex survey responses. But across these domains and types of data, there are common patterns of problems. Which are the biggest problem areas? What factors drive performance? What is the expected outcome? Fortunately, we have also discovered common patterns of analysis and visuals that answer these. Our work involves applying these patterns to any and every dataset. Best thing about your job ... Stumbling on strange patterns that tell a story. For example, when we discovered that 88 people at Modakkuruchi, TN, stood for elections but didn't even vote for themselves, it was a shock. Or when we found that children born in August score much more than children born in July. Or that people taking meter readings don't always visit the premises and cook up numbers that are typically multiples of 10. There are usually several insights hidden in data. For us, it's like exploring Alibaba's cave of treasures. What tools do you use? We use Python (a programming language) for most of our analysis. It's easy to learn, and easy to explore data with. R and Julia are quite popular as well. But Excel remains the primary method for data exploration in most organisations, and is quite effective. However, the tool is often less important than the scientist. A good scientist with a paper and pen will beat a moderate scientist with the best tool available today. How do you use data in daily life? Several of my day-to-day decisions are data-driven. What to eat? I scrape price and calorie information to pick cheap energy-rich foods. What to watch? I visualise the top-rated popular movies by genre from IMDb. When to book a flight? I review flight price trends, and typically book exactly 8 days before the flight. In many ways, my becoming a data scientist was driven by these inclinations. It's not because I'm a data scientist that I do this. It's because I have always done this that I'm a data scientist today. (As told to Narayanan Krishnaswami) Numbers have a story to tell Somewhat like endurance biking, data science is about staying power and enjoying the ride. Little wonder that Raam Nayakar, who is senior manager of marketing analytics and strategy at fashion e-retailer Myntra, follows one as a passion and the other as a profession. Sometimes the twain do meet when the 37-year-old uses his data orientation to find petrol stations and eating joints on remote biking routes. Best thing about the job It's a dynamic field. Finding new ways to analyse data keeps me on my toes. For instance, I recently learnt Python, an open-source analysis system in demand these days. Data analysis sometimes results in counter-intuitive insights, which is very exciting for us. For example, we once told an American wholesale retailer's credit card program to invert their loyalty rewards system and reward low spenders instead of the higher ones. We had identified the highest spenders as mostly re-sellers who did not need to be incentivized. This saved the company millions of dollars. What makes a good data scientist? A data scientist has to have a business context. We should be able to look at numbers, understand what they are telling us, and how that message can be converted into an actionable form. A good data scientist needs to have an eye for detail as well as the big picture. A typical day at work One day I am trying to find which TV channels drive better traffic for Myntra; another day I am engaged in text mining to rank social media responses for a contest we ran. It's the diversity of business problems that keeps my work interesting. Applying data science in daily life When I came back to Bangalore after a few years of living abroad, I was overwhelmed by the traffic. It would take me an hour and fifteen minutes to reach the Hosur Road office from my residence in JP Nagar. In the first month, I tried multiple routes at different timings, assessed areas of traffic congestion, and road conditions. In other words, I analysed the traffic data to construct a route that now takes me less than 45 minutes. Being a data oriented person, I don't miss out on details. My skills help me optimize time and effort even when I am not working. For example, if you want to get good properties to stay during your trips abroad  find out from which country do most of the tourists come from. Then make your booking from a local travel site in that country. I got two nights in a private villa in Bali when I booked from an Australian tour agent site. At the time, Australia contributed over 25% of tourists to Bali. Now, China has overtaken Australia. Is it going to stay a hot job? Many startups are now offering data science incubators and boot camps to train an army of data miners. Business analytics training institutes are offering courses, as are some of the IIMs. Big data is going to get even bigger. (As told to Shobita Dhar)</text>

	<text>Politics seems to power a whole lot of Indian netas who are well over their 70s. Some are star campaigners in the ongoing election battle, notching up half a dozen meetings a day in searing heat. So what keeps them sharp? A few days ago, former PM HD Deve Gowda walked half a kilometre in the summer sun, addressed a rally at noon and then went to meet Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala to talk about the problems in the newly-formed anti-corruption bureau. At Raj Bhavan, he was told the governor was having a siesta. An annoyed Gowda remarked: "Age must be the reason he needs to rest in the afternoon --though I don't think he is as old as me." Vala is 77; Gowda, 84. The neta who never tires or retires pointed out an essential fact of life  some of us slow down as the years catch on while others seem to go from strength to strength. Experts say that each of us ages at different rates, and multiple factors contribute to how we age. Some politicians in India, most of who anyway qualify to lead only when they cross 60, seem to be going strong well into their 90s. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which go to the polls next month, there are two 92-year-olds in the fray. During a recent check-up, physicians found that VS Achuthanandan, 92, who's gunning for the Kerala CM's seat, has a heart that's as healthy as that of a 30-year-old. Over the next few weeks, he'll be traversing most of the state by road, addressing up to five meetings a day. DMK chief M Karunanidhi, also 92, has been drawing up alliances, interviewing candidates and meeting party workers though he's been in a wheelchair since a spinal surgery in 2009. He has never lost an election since 1957 and will be contesting from and campaigning in Tiruvarur this time. Three-time Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, 79, is on the campaign trail every day. In 2011, Gogoi underwent a major heart surgery in Mumbai; this was just six months before the assembly election. He recovered in record time and led the party to a third consecutive victory. Of course these leaders stay active mentally and physically, and some are blessed with great genes, but they are also driven by the force of ambition. "Many people lose their sense of purpose once they retire. Politicians and businessmen have a strong sense of purpose even after 60 and that's what keeps them going," says V Sridhar, coordinator for dementia care at Chennai's Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF). A Bengaluru-based neuroscientist who did not wish to be named says that post-60 the body loses some of its flexibility and power of coordination; the brain's ability to handle multiple tasks declines as does short-term memory. Domain knowledge, however, plateaus after a point and does not decline with age. So it might be increasingly harder to use a new gadget or pick up a new skill, but one's expertise remains sound. And experience gives you an advantage over far younger rivals. This explains how politicians seem to up their game as they get older. "In the very old, the slight loss of cognitive function can be compensated for by increased wisdom. Thus, they can still make good decisions," explains David Gems, professor of biogerontology, Institute of Healthy Ageing, University College London. There is of course enormous variability between people in how they age, points out Gems. These differences seem to result from differences in lifestyle and environment  diet, exposure to pathogens and noxious agents like smog. Heredity also plays a role. The principle of 'use it or lose it' is very operative in cognitive skills: a high level of mental activity helps to keep the brain healthy. "There is also evidence that status affects lifelong health  having high status (i.e fewer bosses) seems to be good for long-term health," says Gems. That could explain how Gogoi, who needs support from his security personnel to climb stairs, is a transformed man when he's on the dais flaying Narendra Modi. Experts say the ageing of the brain and of the body are interlinked. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease and habits such as smoking hit the body and brain health, says the Bengaluru-based neuroscientist. It's a cycle, explains Chennai-based geriatrician V S Natarajan. "Remaining mentally active makes you physically active and vice-versa," he says. Karunanidhi says a daily practice of yoga is "the secret of his energy and success". Achuthanandan thrives on political adrenaline but also gets tetchy if he misses his 30-40 minute brisk morning walk. He normally wakes up at 4.30am, is out for his walk within an hour and then does a round of yoga. In poll season, he sometimes ends up missing his walk, especially when he is away from Thiruvananthapuram. "He is disappointed if he can't walk in the morning," says son V A Arunkumar. Family members believe that strict adherence to routine and a frugal diet keep him fit. Achuthanandan loves to walk along fields and beaches. But on the campaign trail, he makes do with courtyards of guest houses. Gogoi too never misses his morning walk and nightly physiotherapy session. And though he has a sweet tooth and loves fried cashewnuts, his wife keeps a hawk-eyed control on his diet.

	<text>400 years after his death, the Bard is universal, iconic and, most importantly alive, writes Indrajit Hazra Hona, ki nahin hona, yehi to mamla hain.' It's a line that Anurag Kashyap could easily have had Nawazuddin Siddiqui utter as Faizal Khan in a key scene in Gangs of Wasseypur. The line is primal, infused with depth, and comes with a dramatic oomph that sinks it into the deep end of the pop cultural pool. The way Amitabh's 'Mein aaj bhi pheke hue paise nahin uthata' from Zanjeer, or Amjad's 'Yeh haath humko de de, Thakur!' from Sholay, or Bogart's 'We'll always have Paris' does. And yet, there we have it. The iconic line in its original avatar uttered by a choleric member of the Danish royal family  'To be, or not to be, that is the question  was written by an Englishman some 400 years ago. Yes, it's in English. Yes, we associate it with school plays, school textbooks and, most harrowingly, with folks quoting lines from Shakespeare with the express purpose of telling us that they 'know their Shakespeare'. But behind all these lie acres of lines  dialogues, as they say in the industry  dealing with every aspect of the Human Condition: love, fear, guilt, lust, power, hurt, confusion, laughter, and variations thereof that Guru Dutts and Manmohan Desais have made a name and livelihood out of. Four hundred years since the death of William Shakespeare on April 23, 1616, he remains as universal as he remains iconic. But are his works alive for us here in 2016? Do they speak to us with the kind of force and accuracy that the most potent films do? And most importantly, are they meant to? Hell, yes, they are. Shakespeare, it is always good to remember, was working in the 16th century English equivalent of Hollywood/Bollywood. As an actor, writer and part-owner of the 'playing company', Lord Chamberlain's Men, he was the Salim-Javed-Quentin Tarantino of his time and space. He wrote plays not for your family edition of 'The Collected Works of Shakespeare'. He wrote plays for the box office the way SRK plays for it. He doled out bawdy slapstick the front-stallers  the raucous 'groundlings' at the Globe Theatre  philosophical enquiries for the more high-minded, tragedies that would make Devdas stay sober, comedies that would make Woody Allen less neurotic, and 'adult scenes' that one could only enjoy if you downloaded them. Romeo and Juliet was a trailblazing hit not because it was a damn fine romance. It was a super-hit because it turned the spotlight of a holds-barred love story and doused it in that other pop ingredient: the tearjerker tragedy that Salim and Anarkali in Mughal-e-Azam and every young couple negotiating with khap or family will immediately recognise at a stolen matinee rendezvous. And it is impossible for anyone not to recognise the corrosive power of power, and the mechanics of political powerplay, of PG-rated plays like Coriolanus, Richard III  and more fantastically in The Tempest and King Lear  in today's Golden Age of English-language television as one addictively follows shows like The House of Cards, The Game of Thrones, Madmen and The Sopranos. One can rattle off one iconic line after the other  lines that Shakespeare not only invented, but also lines with which he made inventions in the English language itself ('with bated breath', The Merchant of Venice; 'break the ice', The Taming of the Shrew; 'fancy-free', A Midsummer Night's Dream'; 'the green-eyed monster'; Othello, 'wild-goose chase' from Romeo and Juliet). But that is what Shakespeare has brought to one language: English. There is much more that his works hold, like deep shale waiting to be extracted and extricated out of the ivory towers occupied by Shakespeare-walas. There have been countless adaptations of Shakespeare's plays in every possible human language  and non-human too, if one considers Nick Nicholas' and Andrew Strader's Klingon adaptation of Hamlet, with the prince's soliloquy rendered perfectly in the opening line 'taH pagh taHbe'. But for the true force of Shakespeare to come through  in any language and whether rendered in movies, text, or on the stage  his drama has to be unfurled with all its sweat, swagger and, yes, item numbers. Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool and Omkara, the 2004 and 2006 adaptations of Macbeth and Othello set in gangland Mumbai and in the badlands of western Uttar Pradesh respectively, captured this Shakespearean essence. As did his 2014 rendition of Hamlet in Haider set in mid-90s Kashmir. (Rituparno Ghosh's Amitabh Bachchan-starring 2007 film, The Last Lear, was a stilted disaster.) Even 'Bollywood', with its genius for 'dialogues', is naturally inclined to the technicoloured and choreographed world of Shakespeare than the rarefied Shakesperean universe that many of us are more familiar with. It is our good fortune that there is no political entity desperate to appropriate the patron saint of human drama as 'one of their own', as is wont these days. But let it also be our good fortune that we do truly appropriate the works of Will Shakespeare from another language, country and time. If there is one culture that can dive naturally into his bubbling world of drama, melodrama, song and dance, violence, deceit, chaos, lust, disappointment, 'non-vegetarian' jokes.. it is ours. As the man would have said before his next Friday release, 'Readiness hi sab kuchh, bhai.' The Bard at the bar Henry IV "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown," said the Supreme Court in 2012, on then PM Manmohan Singh's position in the 2G spectrum case. Julius Caesar The Supreme Court quoted extensively from Caesar while striking down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which allowed authorities to jail anyone putting up online messages that were considered offensive. The judges drew from Mark Antony's speech to point out the difference between advocacy and incitement. Hamlet Commenting on an Allahabad High Court judgement and alluding to alleged corruption, former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju observed, "Something is rotten in the State of Denmark, said Shakespeare in Hamlet, and it can similarly be said something is rotten in the Allahabad High Court." Shakespeare in the house Hamlet In 2012, then FM Pranab Mukherjee quoted the line, "I must be cruel only to be kind," in his Budget speech to explain tough policy decisions taken for long-term economic gains. Macbeth "Fair is foul, and foul is fair," said HRD minister Smriti Irani during a debate on the JNU arrests and Rohith Vemula's suicide. She was accusing the opposition of twisting facts to suit their stance. Julius Caesar "There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune..." goes the original, but PM Narendra Modi was inspired by it and adapted it in his 2015 speech in the British Parliament to "We must seize the tide in the affairs of men, the world has sought the inspiration to act." Shakespeare as we like it Ahead of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, a look at how he inspired India. The Taming of the Shrew The first Shakespeare play staged in India in an Indian language was by a Parsi theatre group in Surat in 1852. The Gujarati adaptation of Taming was called 'Nathari firangan ne shi rite thekane aani' (How a bad-tempered European woman was tamed). The Merchant of Venice Bengal has had a long love affair with the bard. One of the earliest stage adaptations in Bengali was Bhanumati Chittavilas in 1853. MACBETH Utpal Dutt's Little Theatre Group worked extensively on Shakespeare. In the first phase the thespian simply staged classic Shakespeare in English. By 1970, he was freely experimenting, using jatra in his production of Macbeth. Barnam Van (1979) by writer Raghuvir Sahay was a completely desi spin on Macbeth. Brilliantly mounted at the NSD open-air theatre, it was directed by BV Karanth using elements of Indian folk and classical arts especially yakshagana. In 2012, a Bengali adaptation of Macbeth ruffled Mamata Banerjee's feathers because it had an unflattering reference to the TMC regime Director Vishal Bharadwaj's Maqbool (2003) had Mumbai's gritty underworld as backdrop. Probably, Bollywood's finest Shakespeare. Bhardwaj continued his love affair with Shakespeare in Omkara (Othello) and Haider (Hamlet). Hamlet Shakespeare entered Hindi cinema through Parsi theatre. Parsi actor Sohrab Modi played Hamlet in Khoon ka Khoon (1935), basically a filmed version of the play. The oldest surviving Indian Shakespeare movie dates to 1954. The Hindi Hamlet started veteran actor Kishore Sahu and an 18-year-old Mala Sinha played a strong-willed Ophelia. The Comedy of Errors Do Dooni Chaar (1968), the desi take on The Comedy of Errors scripted by Gulzar, flopped Gulzar adapted the script again for Angoor (1982) which turned out to be a crackling comedy. King Lear In 2011, Soumitra Chatterjee won rave reviews in Raja Lear. At London's Globe to Globe Festival in 1999, King Lear was staged in kathakali. The experiment was received with mixed reviews, with critics pointing out that the fusion left western audiences quite bewildered. Julius Caesar A controversial production of this play by Naseeruddin Shah and Vikram Kapadia took some radical liberties with the script. The criticism that followed provoked Shah to say that Shakespeare is "more revered in India than in his own country". Midsummer Night's Dream Called 'Kamdev ka apna, Basant ritu ka sapna', Habib Tanvir's adaptation used the nacha folk theatre form of Chhattisgarh. In 1997, director Mohan Maharishi turned it into Bagro basant hai with characters named Champa, Chameli and Sadaphuli. Odissi, Bharatanatyam, Chau movements and mudras were brought into the production. Othello Assamese actor Adil Hussain's Othello in Roysten Abel's A Play in Black and White (1999) is rated by critics among the best pieces of Shakespearean acting across the globe. Abel made the play a commentary on racism, linguistic discrimination and a host of contemporary issues. Kathakali Guru Sadanam Balakrishnan's interpretation of Othello was among the more successful experiments. In later productions, dancer Leela Samson joined him as Desdemona. Twelfth Night Atul Kumar's rollicking Hindi version Piya Beharoopiya (2012) was a runaway hit with its use of nautanki, folk and semi-classical music. Antony and Cleopatra In 2015, Kathakali artiste Prabal Gupta choreographed and played Cleopatra-The Last Pharaoh of Egypt in Kathakali last year in Bengaluru.

	<text>No matter how horrific a crime, the accused deserves a defence counsel. But it is not a job for the faint-hearted, say lawyers who've represented some of the most hated figures in recent times "Everyone will hate me, but at least I'll lose," says American lawyer James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies, when asked to defend a Soviet spy. Having taken on this thankless, risky job, he does what any lawyer should do sincerely try to secure justice for his client. People often wonder what prompts lawyers to defend a seemingly "monstrous" or "indefensible" individual. Those questions are being asked again, as the Supreme Court appointed senior advocates Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde as amicus curiae in the Nirbhaya gangrape case that galvanized the nation. Though they already have lawyers, Ramachandran and Hegde have been asked to make sure that the four convicts on death row are given a "full and fair" hearing. Ramachandran, who has been amicus curiae for 26/11-accused Ajmal Kasab and has also represented Yakub Memon in the Supreme Court, is used to having his motives questioned. "When an accused is undefended, the court appoints a lawyer to defend him. To refuse to assist the court, when asked, is a dereliction of duty," he explains. When media and popular opinion demonize the accused, as they did with the Nirbhaya convicts or Kasab, it is a lawyer's job to make sure they get the full hearing they are owed. This is not an endorsement of rape or terrorism. As all first-year law students learn, the lawyer is not defending the crime, but due process. In our adversarial justice system, if you're hauled into court, you need counsel for a fair trial. "The accused has the right to assert his or her innocence by picking holes in the prosecution case. And it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Everything that can be said in favour of the accused needs to be said," says Ramachandran. Take the Kasab case. To a nation shocked by the CCTV footage of his rampage at Chhattrapati Shivaji Terminus, his guilt was clear as daylight. And yet, it had to be established by the court. It was hard to find a defence lawyer, and the few who came forward were threatened by political activists. In fact, the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Court's Bar Association unanimously resolved not to represent alleged terrorists. This is not an isolated incident. Bar associations often turn on lawyers who defend difficult clients. Anjali Waghmare, the first advocate appointed for Kasab, was dismissed immediately because of a clash of interests. Abbas Kazmi, who defended Kasab until November 2009  he was replaced by his assistant KP Pawar  had mounted a spirited defence. Pawar, too, had argued for leniency, saying that "the court should explore the possibility of Kasab's reform and rehabilitation. We have to consider that he is a young man who was brainwashed and blinded by an extremist organization". Kasab's death sentence, though, was upheld all the way until the President's final nod. "Defending the indefensible is not for the weak. It is not only the lawyer but his or her family that needs to be strong,'' says Kazmi. His family went through their own trial in those months, and required separate police protection. "I had three or four police guards at all times," he says. Friends and well-wishers used to express concern and anguish. "They'd ask: why are you risking your life?" recalls Kazmi. The same dilemma faced S Duraiswamy, who defended the accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case in June 1991, braving intimidation from Congress workers. "No other leading criminal lawyer would take up the case," he says. "The court was initially hostile, but as the trial progressed I was able to advance arguments with ease. In 1991 itself, I argued that the suspects could not be tried under TADA. Though the trial court rejected this line, in 1999 the Supreme Court came around and declared that TADA could not be invoked because it was not an act of terrorism." Some lawyers may have a personal code on the subject. "As a general rule I don't appear in rape cases as defence counsel," says senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani. But this is a deviation from the professional norm, which requires lawyers to take on anyone who needs counsel. "A lawyer is not meant to act as a judge before the trial is through," explains Ramachandran. Except for pressing personal reasons or conflicts of interest that make it difficult to push the client's case, an advocate has to follow what Ramachandran terms the "British cab rank rule". "A cab driver at Paddington station is bound to take any person who comes and offers the full fare, and so it is with lawyers," he says. There are several advocates of comparable standing who are asked to step in on controversial cases, not necessarily criminal ones. "Senior advocates have the duty to reinforce this from time to time by accepting such cases", says Ramachandran. It is, in fact, in the most emotionally charged cases, like that of Nirbhaya, that the rule of law must gird itself most strongly. Playing devil's advocate: * Ram Jethmalani defended Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, accused in the Indira Gandhi assassination case * Anand Grover is one of those who appeared for 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon * S Duraisamy, the sole counsel for all the 26 suspects in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case * Raju Ramachandran defended 26/11 accused Ajmal Kasab; is amicus curiae in Nirbhaya case</text>

	<text>Long queues for government-supplied water tankers are a common summer sight in most parts of Rajasthan. But in Laporiya, a village 80 km from Jaipur, a collective effort to harvest water by 350 families has been defying drought for the past 30 years. While ground water has gone down to 500 feet in nearby areas, it is found at 15-40 feet in this village. Not only does lush Laporiya have enough water for its population of nearly 2,000, it even supplies water to some 10-15 surrounding villages. This journey from scarcity to self-sufficiency started in 1977 when an 18-year-old Laxman Singh returned to his village only to find that it gripped by poverty, caste conflicts and malnourishment. The school dropout realized that the only way to stop this vicious cycle of misfortune was to make the area agriculturally prosperous. But water was a big problem  it was available at a depth of 100 feet. "Back then, there were hardly any means to pump out water at such a depth. I decided that if we cannot go down, the water has to come up," said Singh. He then devised the chowka system based on a traditional method of water harvesting in Rajasthan and founded the non-profit organization Gram Vikas Navyuvak Mandal Laporiya (GVNML). Under the chowka system, small, interconnected, sloping rectangular pits, nine inches deep, are made in pasture land. The pits are bordered with bunds (mud embankment). As water assembles in one chowka it flows into an adjacent chowka and then spreads evenly because of the bunds. After crossing several such chowkas, water finally moves into a pond. This method of preserving rainwater makes the top layer of soil moist, recharges ground water, and also enables growth of native grasses and shrubs. Over 15 years, the chowka system was developed on about 400 bighas of pasture land. The villagers came together and contributed money and labour to make the bunds. With the soil gaining moisture, villagers were able to harvest their rabi crop without irrigating their fields. "As there is no withdrawal of ground water for the rabi crop, it gets recharged and is used during summers," said Chotu Singh, a farmer. There's been some smart crop planning too. Villagers stay away from water-intensive crops. During summer, cultivation of only green fodder and vegetables is allowed and that too in fields that are close to the well. The discipline reaped some additional benefits. As the pasture land got green, animals started getting enough fodder. An indigenous breed of cow (Gir) was brought from Gujarat and dairy farming was promoted. Gir produces 8-10 litres of milk in a day and each house now has at least two of them. "Each household makes about Rs 30,000  45,000 a month by selling milk. It's more for those who have over five cows," said Arjun Singh, a volunteer of GVNML. The example has now been followed by 58 neighboring villages and is now spreading to other districts. How they did it: * Adopted traditional water harvesting system * Stayed away from water-intensive crops</text>

	<text>Indian tobacco firms may kick and scream but global experience has shown that graphic is the way to go Appearances count for a lot, when it comes to tobacco control. So it's not surprising that the government and Indian cigarette manufacturers are fighting over a few square inches on a packet. For decades, cigarettes have been sold with images of nonchalance, sexiness and grown-up glamour. Despite anti-tobacco counter-advertising and a generational shift in attitudes, those associations are burnt deep into our minds. These images can only be chased out with opposing images, goes the logic behind graphic labels. Pictorial warnings are meant to drill in the point that cigarettes are not badass, just very bad. The industry has fought warning labels every step of the way, including printing them in tiny typeface, or in gold lettering so that they are less visible. The warning labels themselves have gone from a bland one-liner  "cigarettes cause lung cancer"  to dire and descriptive images of rotting teeth and suppurating tumours. These pictures have to be regularly shuffled so that familiarity with the picture does not blunt the force of the message. There's another way to do it, which is to make the packet itself a neutral background for the warnings. In 2011, Australia became the first country to force tobacco companies to use plain packs  with no company branding, colour, nothing. The effect is that of slipping someone a shameful substance rather than an attractive product. The plain packaging intervention  which Australian officials say has been accompanied by a drop in smoking rate from 15.1% of people older than 14 in 2010 to 12.8% in 2013  has been emulated by France, and other countries are likely to follow. The Indian experience: India, which is second only to China in terms of tobacco consumption, has had anti-tobacco legislation since 1975, but it was only in the 2003 'Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act' that a comprehensive plan was enacted, which stopped advertising, banned smoking from public places, and instituted warnings like "Smoking Kills" with images of skulls and, more bafflingly, scorpions. The more insidious danger in India, though, lies in smokeless tobacco, sold as sachets of inoffensive stimulant to women and even children. Losing the habit  projected to account for 13% of deaths here by 2020  will take a range of counter-measures, and image-warfare is only one of them. In 2014, India decided to enlarge pictorial and text warnings to 85% of the pack, up from the 40% set in 2008. The tobacco industry and its friends resisted the change, and a parliamentary panel chaired by BJP MP Dilipkumar Gandhi made the remarkable contention that there was no "Indian" evidence linking cancer and tobacco. But even as dispute and litigation grinds on, the pictorial warnings kicked in from April 1 this year. Do scary pictures work? Industry studies routinely question the effectiveness of these gruesome images, claim they reveal a paternalist approach, cramp the consumer's right to choose, work against free speech, hurt livelihoods and so on. There is, though, a growing body of evidence that they do work, in tandem with prohibitive taxes. A nine-year study found that Canadian warning labels caused a 2.9-4.7% drop in smoking rates, when prices were rightly factored in, countering the US FDA's contention that they caused only a 0.088% reduction. Another study by the Harvard School of Public Health and the public health foundation Legacy, published January 14, 2013 in the journal PLOS ONE, found that hard-hitting pictorial warnings are more effective than text-only versions, even with vulnerable groups. Pictures transcend language and literacy barriers, and prove especially useful in India. Of course, this will have more of an impact on casual or undecided smokers, than on hardened addicts. Cigarettes are not merely about mental seduction; there is also the rote physical habit, what the poet Billy Collins calls "punctuations of flame and gesture", and the craving for a fix of nicotine. But even if they can jangle the pleasure somewhat, and put off a fraction of potential buyers, the effort would be entirely worthwhile. When it comes to warnings, Thailand's No 1 and India 136 * 77 countries and territories around the world now use graphic pictorial warnings. In 2012, only 55 countries had implemented this rule * 60 have required warnings that cover at least 50% of the pack front and back (on average), up from 47 in 2012, 32 in 2010 and 24 in 2008. Canada led the way with pictorial warnings in 2001, followed by Brazil and Singapore. * Thailand has the world's largest warnings covering 85% of the back and front of packs * At a current 40% of the packet, India is now ranked 136 out of 198 countries, in terms of how prominent its pictorial health warnings are * The US has dragged its feet for decades, and has graphic warnings but no pictures * Australia was the first nation to require that cigarettes be sold in plain packaging, without brand colors and logos. France became the second last week</text>

	<text>In parched Bundelkhand in Madhya Pradesh, villagers in Dargai Khurd and Gour have devised clever ways to recycle water  they bathe on coir cots and place a vessel beneath to collect the water draining down. This will later be used to wash clothes and utensils. Six kilometres farther down in Gayajeetpura, a bath can thankfully still be had without resorting to such extreme economy. This village of 700 in Tikamgarh  the worst drought-affected district in the region  has managed to steer clear of troubled waters by reforming its farming practices. Up until three years ago, the village grew water-guzzling wheat and soyabean like its neighbours and found its yield dropping along with the water level of the local 13th century Chandela-era Kumhedi lake, which was down to 10 feet of water. While the advantageous location of the village  in the downstream of the lake  ensured that it was not as deprived as nearby villages, its depleting water table also served as a caution. After all, 900 water bodies built by the Chandela rulers between the 10th and 13th century are now bone-dry in the region. So three years ago, Gayajeetpura acted on the advice of a non-profit and replaced a part of their crop share with organic horticulture. "It's how we managed to face Tikamgarh's third successive drought," says Rajendra Prasad, a Dalit farmer, who has been sowing vegetables for the last two years on part of his 3-acre plot. While the fields of neighbouring Mohangarh tehsil are scorched, Prasad's fields, along with those of 20 other farmers in Gayajeetpura, are lush green. "We have not only shifted partially from wheat and soyabean to vegetables and fruit like papaya, but we've also started optimizing our use of water," he says. The farmers here have created small slopes on their fields and planted vegetables in close rows on these slopes so that water trickles down and covers a wider area. Nandram, another farmer, grows papaya, tomato, onion, chilli, lady finger and cucumber and earns between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 a week at the weekly market. How they did it: * Shifted to organic horticulture which fetches higher prices * Adopted contour farming on slopes to conserve water</text>

	<text>In his latest work, The Gene, an Intimate History, Pulitzer-winning author and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee examines the role of heredity in our lives On October 6, 1942, five years before my father's family left Barisal, my mother was born twice in Delhi. Bulu, her identical twin, came before her, placid and beautiful. My mother, Tulu, emerged several minutes later, squirming and crying murderously. The midwife must, fortunately, have known enough about infants to recognize that the most beautiful are often the most damned: the quiet twin, on the edge of listlessness, was quite severely undernourished and had to be swaddled in blankets and revived. The first few days of my aunt's life were the most tenuous. She could not suckle at the breast, the story runs (perhaps apocryphally), and there were no infant bottles to be found in Delhi in the forties, so she was fed through a cotton wick dipped in milk, and then from the caul of a cowrie shell shaped like a spoon. A nurse was hired to tend to her. When the breast milk began to run dry at seven months, my mother was quickly weaned to let her sister have its last remnants. Right from the onset, then, my mother and her twin were living experiments in genetics  emphatically identical in nature and emphatically divergent in nurture. My mother  the "younger" of the two by minutes  was boisterous. She had a slippery, mercurial temper. She was carefree and fearless, fast to learn and willing to make mistakes. Bulu was physically timid. Her mind was more agile, her tongue sharper, her wit more lancing. Tulu was gregarious. She made friends easily. She was impervious to insults. Bulu was reserved and restrained, quieter and more brittle. Tulu liked theater and dancing. Bulu was a poet, a writer, a dreamer. Yet the contrasts only highlighted the similarities. Tulu and Bulu looked strikingly similar: they had the same freckled skin, almond-shaped face, and high cheekbones, unusual among Bengalis, and the slight downward tilt of the outer edge of the eye, the trick that Italian painters used to make Madonnas seem to exude a mysterious empathy. They shared the inner language that twins often share. They had jokes that only the other twin understood. Over the years, their lives drifted apart. Tulu married my father in 1965 (he had moved to Delhi three years earlier). It was an arranged marriage, but also a risky one. My father was a penniless immigrant in a new city, saddled with a domineering mother and a half-mad brother who lived at home. To my mother's overly genteel West Bengali relatives, my father's family was the very embodiment of East Bengali hickness: when his brothers sat down to lunch, they would pile their rice in mounds and punch volcanic holes in it for gravy, as if marking the insatiable, perpetual hunger of their village days in the form of craters on their plates. Bulu's marriage seemed a vastly safer prospect by comparison. In 1966, she was engaged to a young lawyer, the eldest son of a well-established clan in Calcutta. In 1967, Bulu married him and moved to his family's sprawling, decrepit mansion in South Calcutta, with a garden already choked by weeds. By the time I was born, in 1970, the sisters' fortunes had started to move in unexpected directions. In the late 1960s, Calcutta began its steady descent into hell. Its economy was fraying, its tenuous infrastructure heaving under the weight of waves of immigration. Internecine political movements broke out frequently, shuttering the streets and businesses for weeks. As the city convulsed between cycles of violence and apathy, Bulu's new family hemorrhaged its savings to keep itself afloat. Her husband kept up the pretense of a job, leaving home every morning with the requisite briefcase and tiffin box  but who needed a lawyer in a city without laws? Eventually, the family sold the mildewing house, and moved into a modest two-room flat  just a few miles from the house that had sheltered my grandmother on her first night in Calcutta. My father's fate, in contrast, mirrored that of his adoptive city. Delhi, the capital, was India's overnourished child. Bolstered by the nation's aspirations to build a mega-metropolis, fattened by subsidies and grants, its roads widened and its economy expanded. My father rose through the ranks of a Japanese multinational firm, clambering swiftly from lower-to upper-middle class. We vacationed in Europe. We learned to eat with chopsticks and swam in hotel pools in the summer. When the monsoons hit Calcutta, the mounds of garbage on the streets clogged the drains and turned the city into a vast infested swamp. One such stagnant pond, festering with mosquitoes, was deposited yearly outside Bulu's house. She called it her own "swimming pool." There is something in that comment  a lightness  that was symptomatic. You might imagine that the sharp vicissitudes of fortune had reshaped Tulu and Bulu in drastically different ways. On the contrary: over the years, their physical resemblance had dwindled to the point of vanishing, but something ineffable about them  an approach, a temperament  remained remarkably similar and even amplified in its convergence. Despite the growing economic rift between the two sisters, they shared an optimism about the world, a curiosity, a sense of humor, an equanimity that borders on nobility but comes with no pride. When we traveled abroad, my mother would bring home a collection of souvenirs for Bulua wooden toy from Belgium, fruit-flavored chewing gum from America that smelled of no earthly fruit, or a glass trinket from Switzerland. My aunt would read travel guides of the countries that we had visited. "I've been there too," she would say, arranging the souvenirs in a glass case, with no trace of bitterness in her voice. There is no word, or phrase, in the English language for that moment in a son's consciousness when he begins to understand his mother  not just superficially, but with the immersive clarity with which he understands himself. My experience of this moment, somewhere in the depths of my childhood, was perfectly dual: as I understood my mother, I also learned to understand her twin. I knew, with luminous certainty, when she would laugh, what made her feel slighted, what would animate her, or where her sympathies or affinities might lie. To see the world through the eyes of my mother was to also see it through the eyes of her twin, except, perhaps, with lenses tinted in slightly different colors. What had converged between my mother and her sister, I began to realize, was not personality but its tendency  its first derivative, to borrow a mathematical term. In calculus, the first derivative of a point is not its position in space, but its propensity to change its position; not where an object is, but how it moves in space and time. This shared quality, unfathomable to some, and yet self-evident to a four-year-old, was the lasting link between my mother and her twin. Tulu and Bulu were no longer recognizably identical  but they shared the first derivative of identity.

	<text>In the sixties, it was hard for a brown man to find a room to let, writes Farrukh Dhondy. Today, Asian fans are donning City's blue and white colours and cheering the club Tom Hanks, superstar, placed a ten pound bet some months ago on a football team called Leicester City. The bookies were at that time offering odds of 1 to 5,000 against them winning the Premier League title. Last week Hanks collected half a million pounds Sterling. The dust hasn't settled yet on Leicester City's unpredicted and spectacular victory. Writers, politicians and other Toms, not to mention Dicks and Harriets are now claiming to be the club's supporters. Julian Barnes, Booker-prize winning novelist, was given space on the front page of the Guardian newspaper to boast about his residence in Leicester and allegiance to the city's football team. Alistair Campbell, Tony Blair's notorious press handler and spin-doctor, wrote a piece saying he was present at the club's final game and was patronisingly pleased to see the spectator stands filled with Asian faces. I too once lived in Leicester. I was at the time writing a post-graduate thesis on Rudyard Kipling at Leicester University and before I enrolled I took the train up from London to find myself a room to live in. This was in 1968 and I did the obvious thing  I went to estate agents who sent me to houses where there were single rooms to let. I must have gone to three or four of these, rung the bell, only to be told that the accommodation had, unfortunately, just been let. Farrukh Dhondy After the third or fourth such rebuttal, I deduced that there was a possibility that the renters didn't like my face or race. I went back to the estate agent in something of a rage and placed my accusation against their clients in as respectful a way as I could. They said they couldn't help. As I walked out of the agent's office I was followed down the street by a secretary from the office. She had overheard the conversation and was sympathetic. She said the only advice she could give me was to go to the 'Asian area' of the city and look for notice boards advertising rooms to let. I asked her where these Asian areas were and she directed me to Narborough Road. I found such a notice board and after one or two phone calls found a room and put a deposit down. At the time the area was populated by Punjabis, mostly Indian and some Pakistani. It was the year of mass migration of Asians from Kenya and later, under the compulsion of Idi Amin's regime, from Uganda. For some reason, a large number of these immigrants, mostly of Gujarati origin, came to Leicester. Over the decades the city became one of the hubs of Asian migration and today it is a multiracial, multicultural city and has elected as its MP, one Keith Vaz, an Indian Christian. The city has, since I was there, changed in very many ways. It now boasts several theatres which put on serious and frivolous Asian entertainment. Highfields, one of the central areas of the city, with ageing Victorian housing stock was settled by mainly Pakistani immigrants. It used to be the red light district and in the eighties the Muslim community made a well-publicised and understandable move to clear the streets of sex-workers. The prostitutes formed a loose union and fought back, asserting the fact that they were there before the Asians came and besides a major part of their clientele was from the community that opposed them. The dispute was settled by a compromise  the girls wouldn't solicit on the streets. In the days when I was turned away on the doorstep while looking for a room, I would in London or Leicester stay away from the streets on the days when a football match was scheduled. British football fans were notorious for their rowdiness and racism and when moving about in gangs singing and shouting raucously were an intimidating lot. I wasn't anywhere near mobs of Leicester fans, known affectionately as 'Foxes', when they celebrated their victory but every TV channel and news report featured the events, outside the stadium and in the streets of the city. It was unusual to see so many Asian fans wearing Leicester's blue and white coloured shirts, shouting slogans, singing silly songs and wrapping themselves in Leicester city scarves. During Margaret Thatcher's Prime Ministership, her lieutenant, Norman Tebbit formulated what became known as the 'Tebbit test' for immigrants: when Britain was playing Pakistan, India or the West Indies at cricket, which team did the British immigrant support? Leicester City is unlikely to be pitted against an Indian or Pakistani football team in the near future, but if it is, its fans, all its fans, will, it's certain pass a modified Tebbit test as true Foxes. City Guide You know Leicester City won the Premier League against staggering odds. But there's more to the place than football First of all, it's 'Lester' not 'Lay-ces-ter' It has the highest number of British Indians in the UK  28.3% of the population of 3,29,000. No wonder, their Diwali celebrations are the biggest outside India Only 50.6% of the population identifies as white, according to the 2011 census It is home to the first Jain temple established in the West It is also home to David Atttenborough and his son Richard And it's the resting place of Richard III</text>

	<text>The MP town rings with the legend of a 19th-century wolf boy whose tale inspired Kipling. Sunday Times goes searching in the jungle of The Jungle Book In Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, Mowgli the man-cub is said to be reared in 'Seeonee hills' by a pack of wolves. Now a burgeoning township in Madhya Pradesh, replete with schools, banks and markets, present-day Seoni bears no semblance of a jungle. Around 122 years ago when the book first came out, it's said the area was part of one big forest. That has now been reduced to the Kanha and Pench sanctuaries connected by a fast-depleting forest corridor. While Kipling's was a work of fiction, it's said to have been inspired by Sir William Henry Sleeman's pamphlet, An Account of Wolves Nurturing Children in Their Dens, which describes a wolf-boy captured near Seoni in 1831. Sleeman was a British soldier and administrator and is known for his work in suppressing thuggery. We found a mention of the wolf-boy named 'Seeall' in Mervyn Smith's Sport and Adventure in the Indian Jungle, which describes his capture and behaviour in captivity. "I have reason to believe that he was the original of Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli," the author writes. It is an intriguing story, one that inspires a trek to Mowgli-land, made even more famous by Disney's latest take on the classic. While Mowgli is a pervasive theme in the district  from his caricatures on bus stands, to an annual Mowgli Mahotsav and even a dedicated statue at the collector's office, few know of the wolf-boy's legend. The only clue is talk about a cave on the outskirts of Kanhiwada, a village that finds mention in the original tale. Sure enough, 3km from Kanhiwada, in a village called Chhui, there's an inconspicuous forest department board that points towards "Amodagadh, the karmasthali of the wolf-child Mowgli". "I have driven past this point numerous times in the last five years. Never have I noticed it before," says Shourabh Ghosh, co-founder of Kohka wilderness camp. Twelve kilometres of dirt track lie ahead. No wonder nobody bothers to find this "tourist spot". The track twists and turns amid fields, and ends up running straight into the forest corridor. The search now feels like a Hardy Boys' unravelling of a mystery shrouded in urban legend. The road poetically ends in a fork. The path to the right, leads to the top of a hillock. A closer inspection reveals the jungle in The Jungle Book. "A hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide," Kipling wrote. We've reached Council Rock  the meeting place of the wolf pack that adopted Mowgli. In the Jon Favreau film, Neel Sethi is not considered 'wolf' enough to join the meetings though he tries hard to be as fast and agile as the other cubs. Looking down from the spot where Akela held court, the Wainganga seems to split the mountain in two. Smooth rocks  some the size of cars  dot the ravine trapped between two almost-vertical cliff walls. Look closely, and one can see why Shere Khan couldn't escape the buffalo herd led by Mowgli that trampled him to death (in the book). This could be the gorge where it all ended. Could it also be the real wolf boy's den? Local legend says so, and PRO of Seoni, Babita Mishra, agrees fervently. "That's the spot where Mowgli was captured," she says, referring to the 1831 incident. Why wasn't it developed as a tourist spot then? There was a plan but it got caught in red tape, she says. Although Kipling never visited Seoni, his book borrowed heavily from Robert Armitage Strendale's books Seonee, Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, and Denizens of the Jungle. Subharanjan Sen, field director of Pench tiger reserve, believes the Amodagadh story is pure conjecture. In the book, Mowgli may have been the target of Shere Khan, but today the tigers of Pench are the ones in danger. Ten tiger deaths have been reported in the past eight months, the last one as recent as March-end when a tigress and her two cubs were found poisoned to death. "Karakal has almost disappeared from this area; about 50 wild buffaloes must be left in surrounding areas; a concerted effort has helped Barasingha numbers pick up in Kanha since the 1960s, when they stooped to a mere 65," says Sen. Moreover, the corridor is thinning. A comparison of forest cover maps from a 1913-26 survey and recent years shows clear signs of deforestation, especially significant around the western edge of Kanha national park. We head back to the fork and take the left this time, 45 gigantic stone steps down to the river bank. Questions about Mowgli's den to the handful of people bathing there draw blanks. "But there is a cave of a Batekhari Baba here," says a fisherman. The famed Mowgli cave is now occupied by a self-proclaimed godman, who has covered the cliff walls with his preachings. He's been meditating there since 1977, the graffiti declares. Dressed in allblack, a white mask and dark shades, this ascetic is keen to tell stories of his chardham yatra on foot, but the moment I ask him about the wolf boy, his 'inner peace' disappears. The choicest of expletives are used to describe Kipling's saga. "There never was a Mowgli," he spits. Whatever the baba's view, somewhere down the river bend, the legend of Mowgli rustles on the jungle floor.</text>

	<text>In an earlier era, a heroine wouldn't dare to take on a superstar Sixteen years ago, a green-eyed boy in a sheer black T-shirt sang about coming and leaving this world empty-handed. India swooned. Women went hysterical and a superstar was born. The perfection of Hrithik Roshan was a running theme that continued to loom over Bollywood for the next fifteen years. Much like that irritating neighbor's child who always came first, never disobeyed his parents and also excelled at athletics, Hrithik Roshan set a new gold standard for what a Bollywood superstar should be. He should look like an underwear model. He should act well. He should dance like a dream. He should churn out blockbusters. He should have the picture perfect family. He could have pedigree to boot as well. Like Raymond from the sitcom, Everyone Loved Hrithik. Well, not everyone, as his recent feud with Kangana Ranaut proves. But this is not about schadenfreude. No one really needs to know details of the private lives of the rich and famous, and they are entitled to their privacy as much as you and I. However, this particular spat is different. Most Bollywood gossip is inane and inconsequential. But this one is playing out entirely in the public domain, with tweets and legal notices. We have two huge stars and consenting adults fighting it out legally and the subtext is ground-breaking in its implication. In fact, risking grave cinematic blasphemy and the wrath of cinephiles, I would like to proclaim that as interesting as Airlift, Aligarh and Neerja were, this year the really interesting churn in the Hindi film industry is happening off-screen. Sometime towards the end of January, Kangana Ranaut gave an interview to Pinkvilla.com where she responded to rumours that Hrithik Roshan had her dropped from Aashiqui 3 after their relationship soured with the statement: "Even a dumb ass can tell where these rumours are coming from. I don't know why exes do silly things to get your attention. For me that chapter is over and I don't dig graves." Basically, she shrugged and said, "Move on". This should have been the end of it, except there was a massive male superstar ego on the other side. A bruised Hrithik took to Twitter to say: Ther r more chances of me having had an affair with d Pope dan any of d (Im sure wonderful)women d media hs ben naming. Thanks but no thanks. That this whole episode has been precipitated by something so innocuous is just laughable but don't let the mangled English throw you off. That tweet is classic Old Bollywood. Entitled. Quick-to-take-offense. Whiny. And male. And it is a perfect revelation of how coddled and thin-skinned A-list male superstars are when they are stripped of minders and image managers who watch over them like hawks. So hurrah for Twitter for giving us a scandal truly tailor-made for these times of social media. And hurrah for Ranaut who's been making something of a habit of routinely puncturing Bollywood norms. Of course, because over-reaction is the name of the game, Roshan didn't stop at the tweet. He also sent her a legal notice, asking her to retract the "silly ex" comment and submit an unconditional apology. Which brings us to the second amazing thing about this episode. The fact that Kangana Ranaut is fighting back. This would never happen a decade ago when a heroine's career would have been too dependent on "goodwill". She would have shut up. Or given a couple of more interviews and gone back crying to her entourage with what is left of her 'reputation'. But not anymore. Ranaut countered Roshan's first legal notice saying that at no point did she actually say that the silly ex in question was Hrithik, leading to another backlash. Roshan filed a complaint alleging that he never had a relationship with Ranaut and that someone impersonated him by creating a fake email id and corresponded with Kangana. Yes. In this age when everyone is a call, Skype, Whatsapp or sext away, Roshan's claim is that two of India's leading actors had a relationship that was conducted entirely on email. Despite them crossing paths ever so often at parties and award functions. Can anyone be so naive? Did they also believe they won the British Lottery? Did a Nigerian prince transfer his wealth to them? Do Bollywood stars know what the internet is? The mind boggles. But back to the plus side. Since then Ranaut has refused to be 'summoned' by the Mumbai Police and has hit back with her own complaint accusing the actor of circulating her images without her consent. As the accusations and counter-accusations pile up, the end looks nowhere in sight but hopefully some good comes out of all the dirty linen that is being aired and Bollywood learns that slut-shaming is no longer acceptable and maybe it's healthier to get over a breakup like the rest of us. By heading to the nearest pub. Or swiping angrily on Tinder.</text>

	<text>The revolutionary is fast turning into an urban pop culture icon with his face on everything from bags and bric-a-brac to mugs and mobile covers. Capitalism Zindabad! Ravi Shekhar, a 19-year-old undergrad at Delhi University with a swagger and sideburns, recently picked up some Bhagat Singh merchandise online  a screen-printed T-shirt and a backpack. Of course he knows who Singh is but no, he didn't know he was recently in the news. "What for?" he asks. "He was called a 'revolutionary terrorist'? Cool." About a week ago Shekhar's alma mater stopped the sale and distribution of the Hindi edition of historian Bipan Chandra's book India's Struggle for Independence, capitulating to ABVP protests over the book's references to Bhagat Singh as a revolutionary terrorist. Whether or not the rest of the country's 18-35-year-olds approve of, or even know of the disputed description, the protagonist himself has their unequivocal vote. For young hipsters, Singh is a desi daredevil, a rebel with a cause, a man of the hour. Literally. He gazes out from watches and wall clocks, but he's also on mugs, wallets, cushions, laptop skins, key-chains, lamps, mobile covers and even wall decals, bearing either of the two versions of his iconic image  turbaned or hatted. The more abstract art pictures him in fractals, or simply with the legend 'Shaheed' or 'Inquilab Zindabad' and a grim noose; some only feature a waxed moustache, shorthand like Gandhi's wire-rim glasses. The universe of Bhagat Singh merchandise on e-commerce sites has exploded in the last year or two, generating new product forms every month. "I come from Punjab, where Bhagat Singh is very popular, so I thought people elsewhere would love him too. I believe his rebelliousness appeals to young people," says Puneet Gupta, co-founder of the merchandise e-store Poster Guy, which retails goods printed with graphic art sourced from designers across the country. Their 'Bhagat Singh' range debuted around Independence Day last year. Raj Kiran Singh, 32, is banking on this home-grown hero-worship. The founder of the bobble and figurine company India Bobbles developed a 5-inch epoxy resin action figure, brandishing a pistol (presumably a stance from his storming of the Central Assembly). On the pedestal is the legend 'Purna Swaraj'. "Sales haven't been good," he admits, "Of the 250 figurines we produced, 100 are still unsold, but that's probably because we overpriced them at Rs 899." The entrepreneur hasn't given up  a bobble head of Bhagat Singh is next. Gupta hopes to build brand Bhagat. "People here wear Che Guevara, but they don't know him; he's just a fashion statement. We're trying to make Bhagat Singh the new Che for Indians." As with anti-capitalist Che, the irony of branding Marxist Bhagat is stark. The global journey of Argentine icon-turned-logo Che Guevara, from Cuban political symbolism (his image was first used by Castro in 1967), to student radicalism (by French student activists in 1968), to mute marketer of everything from condoms to kerchiefs, is a study in the protean power of the icon. Che's classic image was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda in 1960 at a state funeral. Bhagat's famous hatted picture was shot on April 3 1929, at Ram Nath Photographers, at Kashmiri Gate, Delhi. It was meant to solidify his image as a secularist, and disseminated to the press after the April 8 assembly bombing. In India, Gandhi has always been the nation's default national icon  a mutable symbol of freedom, native industry, nationalism and non-violence  deployed by politicians of all stripes, socialists and capitalists hawking sentimentalism. While Bhagat Singh appears to have only recently crossed the threshold of urban pop culture. Professor Y S Alone, who teaches visual studies at JNU's School of Arts and Aesthetics, recalls post-Independence wall calendars that figured the 23-year-old, sometimes in the company of co-conspirators and fellow martyrs Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar. Though Gandhi didn't approve of their anarchy, he too was corralled into the calendars along with the triumvirate. "Post '95 Bhagat Singh returned to prominence because of his political appropriation by the BJP. The commoditisation of a hero is the consequence of his political appropriation," Alone goes on to say. After the Vajpayee government folded in 2004, Bhagat Singh was back on the shelf, only to be dusted down in 2014, when he was hailed as a 'desh bhakt' and 'virat purush' by the campaigning BJP. But do youth shoulder this 'virat purush' on their sleek slingbags as a symbol of patriotism, machismo or vague rebellion? "I hope the image means pride and resistance, but not empty nationalism," ventures Professor Aditya Mukherjee, co-author of the embattled Hindi reader, Bharat ka Swatantrata Sangharsh. "But resistance to what? For Bhagat Singh, it was resistance to imperialism and capitalism. We've seen Ram, who is supposed to be brave and truthful, being used to instigate communal killings. I shudder to think to what ends Bhagat Singh can be employed." Having said that, the academic would rather see Indian hipsters flaunt Singh than Elvis Presley. "It's a small but good step; it shows our youth can count Indian revolutionaries among their heroes, not just American celebrities." The Bhagat Singh you didn't know The only Bhagat Singh India knows is the anti-imperialist revolutionary, but few are aware he had a namesake on another continent. While one Bhagat fought to rid his country of a foreign hand, the other struggled to be naturalized in a foreign land. Bhagat Singh Thind was the older of the two by 15 years. He was born in Amritsar but travelled to America in 1913 to pursue higher studies. Five years later he was recruited by the US Army to fight in World War I, and was even promoted to acting sergeant. In 1918 he applied to the US government for citizenship, which technically only 'free white persons' and those of African descent could apply for. However, several high caste, light-skinned immigrants managed to bypass this because of their skin colour. Thind too was granted citizenship, but it was rescinded four days later. He made two more attempts  in 1923 the matter even reached the Supreme Court, which ruled against him  until his last attempt bore fruit in New York. This March, the Asian-American theatre group, East West Players, staged a play based on Bhagat Singh Thind in schools and libraries in LA. "Part of my fascination with Thind came from the fact that he actually does not occupy a place of prominence in the Indian diaspora," says Mayank Keshaviah, the playwright, "So I felt as if I were uncovering a hidden gem of a story."</text>

	<text>Mansur Ali has spent his life in a border enclave in Cooch Behar. Avijit Ghosh meets the 77-year-old who says he is going to feel like 18 when he gets inked on May 5 Mohammad Mansur Ali Miah has spent his entire life in Poaturkuthi, a quiet village on the edge of Cooch Behar in north Bengal. And yet, the shifts in the sub-continent's geo-politics meant that his country kept changing. He was born in pre-Independence India, grew up in East Pakistan and turned into a senior citizen in Bangladesh. And last July, when India and Bangladesh exchanged enclaves, he became an Indian citizen again. On May 5, Mansur Ali  that's his shorter name on the Aadhar card  will stamp the ballot paper for the first time in his life. "I am 77, but that day I will be just 18," jokes Ali, a community leader. A lifetime in a chitmahal (enclave) means living in one country and being surrounded by another. It's a life of denial and desperation but Ali is not bitter about the cruel punches life threw at him. Ali was born in a family of landowners in 1939. "My grandfather had 39 bighas of land laden with mango trees," he recalls. He went a school in nearby Lauchapra village. Then Partition happened. "There was looting for weeks," Ali says. After Partition, Poaturkuthi became a part of East Pakistan surrounded by Indian villages. He couldn't go to Lauchapra anymore. For some years, he studied in a mediocre local school. "Then my family created a fake address, gave me a fake name and got me admitted to Choudhuryhaat High School on the Indian side in 1956. When I completed matriculation, a teacher offered me a job in a hospital with a monthly salary of Rs 100. But I refused though I knew that my Indian degree was not valid in Dhaka." Like all enclaves, Poaturkuthi was ignored by the state: no development, no electricity and no police. "We were sitting ducks for miscreants," says Ali. In 1966, his father was shot at during a dacoity at his house. Ali recalls getting a taxi and with the help of relatives from across the border, taking his father to MJN hospital in Cooch Behar. "The doctor looked at him and asked, 'Are you a dacoit?' My father replied, 'No. I am from the other side of the border.' He was arrested. But he was also treated for his wounds. Police stood guard outside his ward as he recovered. Later he was produced in court. He was asked to either pay a fine of Rs 5 or spend a week in jail. "But a customs officer helped us out. If this had happened today, my father might have had to spend months in jail. But after that, cross-border interactions became infrequent," says Ali. There was much bonhomie on both sides of the border when Bangladesh was born in 1971, especially because Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were on great terms. When the India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement was signed in 1974, enclave-dwellers hoped their problems would be solved. "But Mujib was killed in 1975 and Indira, in 1984. The issue went into cold storage. Those were hard times. We were often accosted and blackmailed at bazaars and haats if we went to the other side for some work or shopping. Many trespassers were caught and jailed," he says. In 1994, the Bharat-Bangladesh Enclave Exchange Coordination Committee (BBEECC) was formed. There was slow progress on the political and diplomatic fronts too. Finally, last year the two states agreed to an exchange of enclaves. In all, 111 enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi ones in India, involving about 37,000 people, were ready for the swap. On the midnight of July 31, last year, life came full circle for thousands like Ali. He was born in undivided India under British rule and now, he was an Indian citizen again. "The whole village was awake all night  what we experienced cannot be described in words," says Ali, who has six sons and a daughter. Now everyone is waiting for May 5, the day Dinhata constituency, of which Poaturkuthi is a part, goes to vote in the ongoing West Bengal assembly elections. Forward Bloc and Trinamool are strong contenders. But the BJP flag also flutters in this Muslim-dominated village. Like other enclaves, Poaturkuthi was promised a financial package. And, of course, electricity. "We waited 68 years for freedom. Now we are waiting for development and power," says Ali.</text>

	<text>Even as India's first PM is scrubbed out from textbooks, his reputation is being savaged on the internet * Jawahar, the Arabic word for pearl, could not have been chosen by any Kashmiri Brahmin as a name for his child. * Jawaharlal Nehru's grandfather was Ghiasuddin Ghazi, a kotwal of the Mughals, who changed his name to Gangadhar Nehru. * Nehru was born in a brothel in Allahabad. * Nehru got a Catholic nun pregnant, and was indebted to the church for spiriting her away from India. He died of syphilis. * Amitabh Bachchan is his son. Welcome to the virtual world of Nehru vilification. Entirely unhinged from reality, these wild stories about India's first prime minister, who laid the foundations of its democracy, are nonetheless the default on the internet. Unlike the academic challenge of changing details in textbooks, the Web is a terrain for the taking. "Anything that questions dominant historical views is going to find visibility and virality online," says digital media scholar Nishant Shah. Crackpot stories about Nehru have circulated for decades - for instance, former RSS chief K S Sudarshan has claimed that Nehru killed Gandhi. But "these are voices that never made it to the mainstream. Now, because there is such a preponderance of them online, these rumours take on a life of their own," says Rohit Chopra, media studies professor at Santa Clara University, who works on online Hindutva. This is particularly problematic because for many people now, reality is what they can find through Google, he says. Nehru, of course, is highest on the list of hate objects for Hindutva extremists. "After Partition, and even more after Gandhi's murder, Nehru was convinced that India must not in any circumstances become a Hindu Pakistan. He saw the RSS as dangerous because of its demonising of minorities, and repeatedly and publicly attacked it," says historian Ramachandra Guha. And the RSS continues to attack him right back. The hegemony of his ideas, and the persistence of his bloodline are both intolerable to them. "Indira's, Rajiv's, Sanjay's, Sonia's and Rahul's mistakes (real or imagined) are retrospectively attached to Nehru," says Guha. On YouTube, a search for Nehru throws up smear after smear. The first, declaring him "Hindustan ka sabse ayyash aadmi", was watched 40,16,640 times at last count. These stories lay bare the campaign against him  Nehru must be cast as Muslim, westernised and dissolute, to discredit him. To establish him as a philanderer, there is a patchwork of images of Nehru at innocuous moments, with Jacqueline Kennedy and Mrinalini Sarabhai, embracing his sister at the airport, lighting a woman's cigarette. Last year, Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Centre for Internet and Society, caught sneaky edits to the Wikipedia entries of Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru, emanating from a central government IP address. Recently, a patently fake and misspelt "historical" letter did the rounds, where Nehru supposedly described Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal. The right wing has mastered the arts of seeding misinformation, says Shah. Their claims do not come from one author, but from many different users, each adding layers to the rumours. Then, he says, "It is a matter of faith through repetition, rather than truth through inquiry". While such conspiracy theories sprout all around the world, in India, they dominate search results, says Prakash. Apart from forums that rationally disagree with Nehruvian economics, foreign policy or defence, or make credible assertions about his positions, there are voices that simply slander Nehru. "Many kinds of right-wing animosities, economic, cultural and those that are reacting to the actions of the Nehru Gandhi family, come together in this attack," observes Prakash. These ideas have also taken root, to some extent. A startup employee unconnected to any political party recently set up a Twitter handle called Nehruvian, trying to counter such propaganda. He explains why he was stirred into action - "On a train to Lucknow, I was reading The Discovery of India, when a young man in his twenties asked me, "kyon padh rahe ho is chor ki kitaab?" And yet, there is no way to counter motivated rumours, short of undesirable censorship. Propaganda is a legitimate activity, and any rebuttal is also likely to be confined to its own echo chamber, Shah points out. Rather, what is needed is a new digital literacy, the "capacity to sift trustworthy information, to look critically at the sources they come from", says Prakash. As for Nehru, it may not be easy for textbook warriors of keyboard guerrillas to dislodge him. If after 52 years, there's still so much panic about his legacy, there must be something very durable about it."</text>

	<text>Whether it's the Mercedes hit-and-run in Delhi or the antics of the chaddi baniyan gang in Mumbai, police are increasingly relying on CCTV footage to solve crimes. Sunday Times looks at how the small picture is getting bigger In case after high-profile case, cameras have been the big stars of Delhi police investigations in recent months. After the Civil Lines hit-and-run case, where a 17-year-old driving a Mercedes was caught on camera speeding away from his victim, reliable witness to the crime came from a nearby CCTV. A few weeks ago, in the Vikaspuri lynching on Holi eve that threatened to take on communal colours, it was CCTV footage that clinched the case. Across India, police officials reel off cases where CCTVs have made all the difference in identifying offenders and speeding up investigations. "Petty crimes like snatchings have been brought down by 50% in areas like Chandni Chowk since 2014," estimates Madhur Verma, DCP (north), Delhi Police. "Even if the face cannot be fully recognised, the timing shown on the CCTV grabs, and proof of the accused being present at the spot, can be useful corroborating evidence for the court," says DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni, explaining how CCTV helped nail the infamous "chaddi baniyan gang" in Borivli, Mumbai. CCTV cameras have proliferated across our public spaces in the last few years, mutely observing our movements. It's not just the police; shops, companies and individuals install them too, and these come in handy for law enforcement. For instance, Delhi has about 1,79,000 CCTV cameras installed around the city, out of which 4,000 have been placed by the Delhi government, and the rest by private agencies who collaborate with the Delhi Police under its 'Eyes and Ears' scheme. "Cameras are a fact of life around the world, there's no going back for the police or for anyone else," says N Ramachandran, a former IPS officer, now president of the Indian Police Academy think-tank. Whether London, Boston or Bengaluru, it is often a terrorist attack that shocks a city into ramping up its CCTV network. After the Church Street attacks, the police got cracking on surveillance, using crime-mapping techniques and shortlisting vantage points. While they currently use 300 cameras, the police believe the figure must be taken up to 2,500 to keep a better eye on the city. But does CCTV control crime? To that question, there is only one unsatisfying answer  it depends. The debate is torn between those who see CCTVs as the embodiment of an eerie Orwellian warning, and those who believe that the more cameras there are, the less crime there will be. Studies, though, suggest that CCTV has specific and narrow uses. Obviously, it helps catch people who have committed an offence, after the event. CCTV networks, though, have no noticeable impact on crime rates according to several reviews in the US and UK. The UK is the most monitored nation in the world, but as a Home Office study in 2005 concluded, there was no statistically significant reduction in crime, once other variables like seasonal and national trends, and other police initiatives, were factored in. While CCTVs are not easy to isolate as a determining factor in crime control, they are demonstrably effective in some contexts. They can reduce some kinds of disorder and petty crime, particularly in car parks and public transit. Micro-level analyses of aspects like environmental features, camera line-of-sight, enforcement activity, and camera design suggest that the power to deter crime depends greatly on how the CCTV sites are chosen, and police operations designed. The downsides are well known. The more mundane footage there is, the harder it is for police to sift through. There is often a displacement effect  the presence of a camera pushes the crime off-stage into other areas, or prompting criminals to change tactics in pursuit of the same ends (ie, rather than carry out a drug transaction on the street, arrange online and deliver). What's more, CCTVs can be gamed. In Mumbai, the police has found out that criminals apply toothpaste or flash a torchlight at the lens, or cover up with helmets and burqas, or even steal the digital video recorder in the CCTV. These cameras have to be constantly maintained. "Many believe that CCTV installation is a one-time investment, but it needs to be serviced to yield results," says S. David, who runs an electronics shop and sells CCTV cameras in Chennai's Ritchie Street. If there is no overwhelming impact on crime prevention, why are India's security forces investing so heavily in CCTVs, and is it worth the inevitable tradeoff with privacy? More worryingly, it is doing so without any comprehensive regulation on their use. Before this technology of databases and recording, "we seldom had situations where a police official or private detective was trailing you all day, recording your movements, which is more or less the situation with CCTVs now," says Pranesh Prakash of the Centre for Internet and Society. "Yes, you're in a public space, but that doesn't denude you of privacy". But as Farhad Manjoo, a prominent tech blogger in the US, pointed out, the benefits outweigh our fears about privacy. "When you weigh cameras against other security measures, they emerge as the least costly and most effective choice. In the aftermath of 9/11, it's impossible for you to get into tall buildings, airports, many museums, concerts, and even public celebrations without being subjected to pat-downs and metal detectors. When combined with competent law enforcement, surveillance cameras are more effective, less intrusive, less psychologically draining, and much more pleasant than these alternatives," wrote Manjoo in Slate. What we need is public oversight over the surveillance apparatus  in other words, we need to watch how they watch us. If there is clear respect for the principles of proportionality, accountability and transparency, "there need not be a conflict between ethical and effective use of these cameras," says Ramachandran.

	<text>You can see them in almost every village in drought-hit Marathwada  people, especially women and children, walking miles to fetch a single pot of water. But tiny Patoda, on the fringes of water-starved Aurangabad city, is different. It is surrounded by arid villages but people here just go to the water ATM nearby to get their share of potable water. Patoda's residents have learnt a valuable lesson  that water is more precious than money. They follow strict rules about usage and water audits are stringent. Households have water meters and the entire village recycles every drop of waste water it generates. So effective is its water conservation model that Patoda has now become a model for the rest of Marathwada. "It didn't happen overnight. We have been working for the last 10-12 years to ensure that every raindrop is saved and no water, not even waste, flows out of our village. The water balance sheet you see today is the result of strict discipline," says Bhaskar Pere-Patil, who developed the water model which has won 22 state and national awards. "The drought in Marathwada is man-made. People have failed to make efficient use of available water or recycle it. If Israel can perform miracles in its arid land, why can't we?" Pere-Patil asks. Patoda's story is the stuff film scripts are made of. It used to be a filthy village that suffered perennial water shortage. Pere-Patil, who has only studied till Class VII, was once a local hooligan who terrorized villagers into voting for him as sarpanch. In the years when he headed the village, he did nothing for it. Then one day, 10 years ago, Pere-Patil happened to overhear villagers talking about him. "I was shocked to learn that people saw me as some kind of a wild animal. I realized that they showed me deference only because I had money and muscle. I would earn their respect only if I did something for them," says Pere-Patil. Not only did he decide to change himself, but he also set about driving change in the village. His first initiative was to stop open defecation. Then came the troubling issue of water. "Initially, we went along only because we were afraid of him. But after some time, we realized that he is genuinely trying to change himself and the village," say the women. They soon joined his mission. The Kham River, which flows past the village, had been reduced to a nullah with unchecked release of sewage and effluents. The wells had no potable water and the government water supply scheme was neither enough nor potable. "We were forced to look elsewhere for a solution. We could not generate water, but we could certainly conserve what we get. The first step was saving rainwater by building several bunds across the nullahs. Today, no rain water flows out of our village. Percolation has recharged the aquifers and the water table has risen," says Pere-Patil. Once water was available in village wells, the gram panchayat decided to set up a water filtration plant on its own. Then came the concept of a water meter and ATM machine. Though there were government funds for various schemes the core contribution came from the villagers. Today, the gram panchayat provides 20 litres of filtered mineral water free to all the 581 families that use ATM cards. The machine operates 24x7 through the year. "It will never be empty. We have deposited all our effort in it," says youngster Ravindra Jadhav as he inserts a card into the slot to draw 20 litres of water. Additional filtered water is available through metered water supply at Rs 5 per 1,000 litres. Water from the government supply scheme and some wells is used for washing and cleaning. How they did it: * Bunds built to save rain water * Stabilisation ponds set up. Here, multiple forms of bacteria and algae act together to clean waste water which is then used for farming ? Water meters installed to curb use</text>

	<text>l Jan 21, 2015: Gangster Sukha Kahlon is gunned down in Phagwara by a rival gang. The killers dance around his bloodied body, shoot a video and post it online. On the Facebook page of Kahlon, who was facing 40 criminal cases, RIP messages pour in and many swear revenge. l Feb 20, 2016: Ravi Khwajke, a sarpanch, is shot dead at a marriage function in Ludhiana. Notorious hitman Davinder Bambiha takes 'credit' for the murder on his FB page, gets over 500 'likes'. l April 30, 2016: Gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky is shot dead near Parwanoo in Himachal triggering an online war among criminals to hog credit. Welcome to the ganglands of Punjab where rival gangsters are not only bumping off each other on the streets but also boasting about their crimes on social media while projecting themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods. Many of these bandolier-sporting and gun-toting gangsters call themselves 'Lions of Punjab'; some have pictures of Khalistani icon Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as their FB cover photo. For them, a murder is not complete until they take responsibility for it online for all to know and 'like'. Last month when gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky, who faced multiple criminal cases and had contested the 2012 Punjab assembly elections from Fazilka and almost won, was slain near Parwanoo, it sparked off hectic online activity among criminals. A day later, gangster Jai Pal, an ex-cop's son from Ferozepur who is on the run, posted that he was the one who had actually killed Rocky, a claim the cops are taking seriously given his crime record. The same day friends and followers of Rocky created 'RIP Jaswinder Singh Rocky'  thousands posted messages on the page, calling Rocky a 'legendary man' and swearing revenge. Many of the gang-related murders in the last four years were instigated on Facebook  the killers boasted about their deed and humiliated rivals by posting messages on the pages of their victims. The hate messages are not removed by gangs and continue to feed their hatred for years. The celebratory video clip made by Kahlon's killers went viral last year. Even those in high-security jails across Punjab have been updating their FB accounts, taking credit for various crimes. But prison officials insist these are being operated by their supporters outside. ADGP (Prisons) M K Tiwari says, "We raided three jails after the killing of gangster Rocky but did not recover any SIM or phone, including in Nabha Jail, where gangster Vicky Gounder, who claimed responsibility for Rocky's killing, is lodged." Rajesh Gill, professor of sociology at Panjab University, says it's a worrying trend. "Some youngsters continue to eulogize militancy and believe that guns and violence are the easiest and shortest way to fame. This is also reflected in popular Punjabi songs, which are all about guns and killings," he says. Incidentally, the Punjabi Sahit Akademi had recently passed a resolution against Punjabi songs that glorify gun culture, saying such songs brainwash youngsters into believing there is pride and glory in crime. Gangsters also post messages of courage and fearlessness on their pages, portraying themselves as brave do-gooders on the wrong side of the law. Jitender Mohan, professor emeritus of psychology, Panjab University, says 'showing off' and bragging are part of Punjabi culture. "These gangsters are also desperate attention seekers and have found that the easiest way to fame, rather infamy, is through guns and false bravado," says Mohan. Is there no stopping them? According to IGP (cyber crime) P K Sinha, the cyber cell has been tracking the activities of gangsters online and action will be taken soon. "We are in the process of approaching Facebook headquarters in California through MHA to request them to disable some of the accounts. We are also exploring legal ways under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which authorizes law enforcement agencies to act against people using the internet against the sovereignty of the state," he adds. In the meantime, the gangs seem to be plotting their next hit. A day after Rocky's murder in Himachal, gangster Jaipal sent a chilling warning to rival gangs and cops in a message on FB: "The game has just begun. Just Wait and Watch." (With inputs from Vaivasvat Venkat in Ludhiana) Online lives of dead gangsters Shera Khuban: Headed the Gounder gang and was killed by Punjab police in Sept 2012, allegedly on a tipoff from Rocky's gang members.

The FB page of Gounder gang has over 5,000 likes and members post important and frequent updates here Happy Deora: A close pal of gangster Jai Pal and later Rocky, Happy was killed allegedly by Shera Khuban in July 2012. RIP messages still continue to pour in on his FB page Sukha Kahlon: Nicknamed himself 'Sharpshooter', had over 10 FB pages, some of them by his fans, and many continue to be operational. After his murder, his FB page had issued warnings to two Punjab cops. One of his FB pages introduces him as "25 pindaaaa ch charcha... Jatt te 302 da parcha...

	<text>NEW YORK: Most pregnant women or women who may become pregnant are often advised to take folic acids to help prevent certain birth defects. However a new study reveals that very high levels of the vitamin in the mothers' blood can be linked to higher risk of autism in their children. The new research has raised some questions from some experts while some other experts say it raises an intriguing question that should be explored. The researchers themselves said there's no cause to change current public health recommendations. The findings are to be discussed on Wednesday at an autism research conference in Baltimore. Folate is a vitamin found in foods. A synthetic version, folic acid, is used in supplements and fortified foods.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Traditionally it was believed that young Earth had a thicker atmosphere, but scientists have found that air at that time exerted at most half the pressure of today's atmosphere. The new finding reverses the commonly accepted idea that the early Earth had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for weaker sunlight. The finding also has implications for studies that relate to gases in that atmosphere and how biology and climate worked on the early planet. "For the longest time, people have been thinking the atmospheric pressure might have been higher back then, because the sun was fainter," said lead author Sanjoy Som, who did the work as part of his doctorate in earth and space sciences at the University of Washington. The team used bubbles trapped in 2.7 billion-year old rocks to reach this conclusion. "Our result is the opposite of what we were expecting," he added in a paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Som is currently doing research in astrobiology at NASA's Ames Research Centre in California. Co-author Roger Buick, professor of earth and space sciences, came upon the idea of using bubbles trapped in cooling lava as a "paleobarometer" to determine the weight of air in the planet's youth. Then a potential site in western Australia was discovered by co-author Tim Blake of University of western Australia, where the Beasley river has exposed 2.7 billion-year-old basalt lava. A stream of molten rock quickly cools from top and bottom, and bubbles trapped at the bottom are smaller than those at the top. The size difference records the air pressure pushing down on the lava as it cooled, 2.7 billion years ago. Rough measurements in the field suggested a surprisingly lightweight atmosphere. More rigorous x-ray scans from several lava flows confirmed the result: The bubbles indicate that the atmospheric pressure at that time was less than half of today's. Earth 2.7 billion years ago was home only to single-celled microbes, sunlight was about one-fifth weaker and the atmosphere contained no oxygen. But this finding points to conditions being even more otherworldly than previously thought. A lighter atmosphere could affect wind strength and other climate patterns and would even alter the boiling point of liquids. Other geological evidence clearly shows liquid water on Earth at that time so the early atmosphere must have contained more heat-trapping greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide and less nitrogen. The result also reinforces Buick's 2015 finding that microbes were pulling nitrogen out of Earth's atmosphere some three billion years ago. "People will need to rewrite the textbooks," the authors noted. The researchers will now look for other suitable rocks to confirm the findings and learn how atmospheric pressure might have varied through time.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The local atmosphere in Mars is clear in winter, dustier in spring and summer, and windy in autumn, NASA scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have found. NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover, which has completed its second Martian year since landing inside Gale Crater nearly four years ago, recorded environmental patterns through two full cycles of Martian seasons, scientists said. The repetition helps distinguish seasonal effects from sporadic events. For example, a large spike in methane in the local atmosphere during the first southern-hemisphere autumn in Gale Crater was not repeated the second autumn, they added. "Curiosity's weather station has made measurements nearly every hour of every day, more than 34 million so far," said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. "The duration is important, because it is the second time through the seasons that lets us see repeated patterns," he said. It was an episodic release, still unexplained. However, the Rover's measurements do suggest that much subtler changes in the background methane concentration, amounts much less than during the spike, may follow a seasonal pattern, the scientists said. Measurements of temperature, pressure, ultraviolet light reaching the surface and the scant water vapour in the air at Gale Crater show strong, repeated seasonal changes, they said. Curiosity's Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) has measured air temperatures from 15.9 degrees Celsius on a summer afternoon to minus 100 degrees Celsius on a winter night. "Mars is much drier than our planet, and in particular Gale Crater, near the equator, is a very dry place on Mars," said German Martinez from University of Michigan. "The water vapour content is a thousand to 10 thousand times less than on Earth," said Martinez. Each Martian year - the time it takes the Red Planet to orbit the sun once - lasts 687 Earth days. Curiosity landed on August 5, 2012. It began its third Martian year on May 11 this year during the mission's 1,337th Martian day, or "sol" since landing. Each Martian sol lasts about 39.6 minutes longer than an Earth day, and a Martian year lasts 668.6 sols, scientists said. Relative humidity is a function of both temperature and water-vapour content. During winter nights, Curiosity has measured relative humidity of up to 70 per cent, high enough to prompt researchers to check for frost forming on the ground, they added.</text>

	<text>New Delhi: Gilead Science Inc, a US-based pharmaceuticals today confirmed that prices of its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi will not be affected despite granting of patent to it by the country's patent office. Although the medicine is quoted at USD 1,000 a pill in the US, its generic version is priced at USD 13.71 per pill in India. The Indian Patent Office (IPO) recently granted the patent for the drug to the company. "It (patent grant) will have no impact on prices in India. Our licensing programme is already working well, with our licensed partners already having launched low-cost, high-quality product in the country and in the licensed territory," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed response. Quoting data from hepcasia.com, an organisation focussed on work related to hepatitis C in Asia, the company said the price of generic sofosbuvir and ledipasvir fixed-dose combination sold by various firms, including Biocon, Cipla, Abbott, Natco and Sun Pharma, in India are priced at USD 384 per bottle of 28 pills. Insisting that recognition of intellectual property (IP) is central to investment in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, the company said Indian patent office's decision underlined "the scientific innovation involved in the development of this breakthrough treatment for chronic hepatitis C". "It is the company's goal to enable access to these medicines for as many people as possible, as quickly as possible," the spokesperson added. The issuing of patents is often seen as a barrier to access to drugs in the developing countries. However, Gilead believes that if used responsibly, IP does not hinder access, supporting a sustainable model of voluntary generic licensing for more than a decade, the company spokesperson said. Last year, Gilead had signed licensing deals with pharma firms, including Natco, Hetero Drugs, Cipla, Ranbaxy, Cadila, Mylan Laboratories, Sequent Scientific and Strides Arcolab, among others, to manufacture and market the drug in India. "This licensing programme enables manufacturing and distribution of high-quality, low-cost versions of the company's medicines for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C," the company's spokesperson had said. The patent authority had earlier rejected the company's patent application in 2015. Sovaldi was launched in 2013 in the American market for USD 28,000 for a 28-capsule bottle. It was approved under the trade name Sovaldi by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in December 2013 and the European Commission in January 2014.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Scientists have been able to determine the evolution of single-humped camels to their use by humans who have primarily used them as means of transportation in deserts for over 3000 years. According to scientists, including researchers at University of Nottingham, UK, long-distance, back-and-forth movements in ancient camel caravan routes were key points in shaping camel's genetic diversity. Single-humped 'Arabian camels', known as 'dromedaries' (Camelus dromedarius), have been fundamental to the development of human societies, providing food and transport in desert countries for over 3000 years and continue to be a vital resource in trade and agriculture in hot, dry areas of the world, providing transport, milk and meat where other species would not survive. Scientists combined this with ancient DNA sequences from bone samples of early-domesticated dromedaries from 400-1870 AD and wild ones from 5,000-1,000 BC to show for the first time ever an historic genetic picture of the species. "Our analysis of this extensive dataset actually revealed that there is very little defined population structure in modern dromedaries," said Oliver Hanotte from University of Nottingham. "We believe this is a consequence of cross-continental back and forth movements along historic trading routes. Our results point to extensive gene flow which affects all regions except East Africa where dromedary populations have remained relatively isolated," Hanotte said. In the current context of climate change and advancing desert landscapes, the animal's importance is increasing and there is new interest in the biology and reproduction of the species, researchers said. They collected and analysed genetic information from a sample of 1,083 living dromedaries from 21 countries across the world. "The dromedary has outperformed all other domesticated mammals, including the donkey, in arid environments and continues to provide essential commodities to millions of people living in marginal agro-ecological areas," said Faisal Almathen from King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia. "The genetic diversity we have discovered, thanks to restocking from wild 'ghost' dromedary populations, is quite remarkable in the history of its domestication," Almathen said. "It underlines the animal's potential to adapt sustainably to future challenges of expanding desert areas and global climate change," he added. The findings were published in the journal PNAS.</text>

	<text>New York: A new study has revealed that low doses of a general anaesthetic drug is likely to reduce suicidal thoughts in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The study states that giving repeated low doses of ketamine in depressed patients with recurrent suicidal thoughts might help them in recovering rapidly. "Our finding that low doses of ketamine, when added on to current antidepressant medications quickly decreased suicidal thinking in depressed patients, is critically important because we don't have many safe, effective and easily available treatments for these patients," said Dawn Ionescu, lead researcher from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the US. Having suicidal thoughts increases the risk that patients will attempt suicide. However, the risk of suicide attempts is 20 times higher in patients with depression than the general population. The study, published online in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, was designed not only to examine the antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of repeated low-dose ketamine infusions, but also to examine the safety of increased ketamine dosage. The team enrolled 14 patients with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression who had suicidal thoughts for three months or longer and they received two weekly ketamine infusions over a three-week period. The initial dosage administered was 0.5 mg/kg over a 45-minute period which is five times less than a typical anaesthetic dose. After the first three doses the amount was increased to 0.75 mg/kg. The participants were assessed on measures of suicidal thinking. The patients were directly asked to rank whether they had specific suicide-related thoughts, their frequency and intensity. The results revealed that most of them experienced a decrease in suicidal thinking, and seven achieved complete remission of suicidal thoughts at the end of the treatment period. "The study that aim to understand the mechanism by which ketamine and its metabolites work for people with suicidal thinking and depression may help us discover areas of the brain to target with new, even better therapeutic drugs," Ionescu concluded.</text>

	<text>LONDON: Scientists in the UK have discovered a protein which helps embryos stick to the womb and improve treatments for recurrent miscarriages and pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure. The pioneering study by scientists at the University of Sheffield shows that a protein called Syncytin-1, which was the result of a viral infection of our primate ancestors 25 million years ago, is first secreted on the surface of a developing embryo even before it implants in the womb. This means the protein is likely to play a major role in helping embryos stick to the womb as well as the formation of the placenta. This fundamental understanding of the earliest stages of human embryo development is crucial for improving current treatments for a variety of stressful complications during pregnancy such as recurrent miscarriages, foetal growth restriction syndrome and pre-eclampsia -- a life-threatening condition of elevated maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. "Recurrent miscarriages, foetal growth restriction syndrome and pre-eclampsia are all significant and very stressful complications of pregnancy," Professor Harry Moore, Co-Director for the University's Centre for Stem Cell Biology and lead author of the study said. "Eventually we may be able to develop blood tests based on our results to identify pregnancies that might be at risk and also develop appropriate therapies. There is a lot on the news about the Zika virus infection at the moment and its devastating effects on foetal development but not all viral infections are necessarily as disastrous," he said. "Amazingly the Syncytin-1 gene is the result of a viral infection of our primate ancestors 25 million years ago. The viral DNA got into our ancestors genome and was passed on through heredity and the gene involved in the fusion of the virus with cells for infection was co-opted and became Syncytin-1," he said. "Without it humans probably would not have evolved. Surprisingly scientists know much more about the processes of early embryo development in animals than they do in humans," he added. However, embryo development and reproduction is an aspect of biology where there are fundamental differences between species. Researchers will now investigate whether the level of Syncytin-1 secretion on the pre-implantation embryo is somehow related to outcome of pregnancy in women undergoing IVF. The study was published today in the journal "Human Reproduction".</text>

	<text>LOS ANGELES: The Solar Impulse 2 took off from Phoenix, Arizona to Oklahoma on Thursday, resuming its record-breaking quest to circle the globe without consuming a drop of fuel. The experimental solar-powered plane, piloted by Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard, took off at 3am (1000 GMT), live footage showed, for the latest stage of its around-the-world flight aimed at drawing attention to clean energy technologies. The flight to the city of Tulsa is expected to take 17 and a half hours. The plane is set to make one or two more stops in the United States before finally landing in New York City, in the latest leg of their journey that kicked off on March 9, 2015. "The objective is to reach New York as soon as possible!" the Solar Impulse 2 team said in a statement Wednesday, though it is not clear when they might reach the city. After crossing the United States, Piccard and his teammate Andre Borschberg are set to make a trans-Atlantic flight to Europe, from where they plan to make their way back to their point of departure in Abu Dhabi.</text>

	<text>CAPE CANAVERAL: Astronomers have discovered 1,284 more planets beyond our solar system, with nine possibly in orbits suitable for surface water that could bolster the prospects of supporting life, scientists said on Tuesday. The announcement brings the total number of confirmed planets outside the solar system to 3,264. Called exoplanets, the bulk were detected by Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which searched for habitable planets like Earth. The new planets were identified during Kepler's four-year primary mission, which ended in 2013, and previously had been considered planet-candidates. Scientists announcing the largest single finding of planets to date used a new analysis technique that applied statistical models to confirm the batch as planets, while ruling out scenarios that could falsely appear to be orbiting planets. "We now know there could be more planets than stars," Paul Hertz, Nasa's astrophysics division director, said in a news release. "This knowledge informs the future missions that are needed to take us ever closer to finding out whether we are alone in the universe." Of the new planets, nearly 550 could be rocky like Earth, Nasa said. Nine planets are the right distance from a star to support temperatures at which water could pool. The discovery brings to 21 the total number of known planets with such conditions, which could permit life. Kepler looked for slight changes in the amount of light coming from about 150,000 target stars. Some of the changes were caused by orbiting planets passing across, or transiting, the face of their host stars, relative to Kepler's line of sight. The phenomenon is identical to Monday's transit of Mercury across the sun, as seen from Earth's perspective. The analysis technique, developed by Princeton University astronomer Tim Morton and colleagues, analyzed which changes in the amount of light are due to planets transiting and which are due to stars or other objects. The team verified, with a more than 99 percent accuracy, that 1,284 candidates were indeed orbiting planets, Morton said. The results suggest that more than 10 billion potentially habitable planets could exist throughout the galaxy, said Kepler lead scientist Natalie Batalha, with Nasa's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. The nearest potentially habitable planet is about 11 light years from Earth. "Astronomically speaking, that's a very close neighbor," she said.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: An experimental malaria vaccine has been found to protect a small number of healthy people from infection for more than one year after immunization, says a study. The vaccine, known as the PfSPZ Vaccine, was developed and produced by US-based pharmaceutical company Sanaria. "It is now clear that administering the PfSPZ Vaccine intravenously confers long-term, sterile protection in a small number of participants, which has not been achieved with other current vaccine approaches," said principal investigator of the trial Robert Seder from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National Institutes of Health. NIAID researchers and collaborators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore conducted the clinical evaluation of the vaccine, which involved immunisation and exposing willing healthy adults to the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum (P falciparum) in a controlled setting. The parasites that cause malaria are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. The PfSPZ Vaccine is composed of live, but weakened P. falciparum sporozoites  the early developmental form of the parasite. Previous research showed the PfSPZ Vaccine to be highly protective three weeks after immunisation. In this trial, researchers assessed if protection could last for five months to a year. For the phase one clinical trial, the researchers enrolled 101 healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years who had never had malaria. Of these volunteers, 59 received the vaccine and 32 participants served as controls and were not vaccinated. Vaccine recipients were divided into several groups to assess the roles of the route of administration, dose, and number of immunisations in conferring short- and long-term protection against malaria. To evaluate how well the vaccine prevented malaria infection, all participants  including the control participants who were not vaccinated  were exposed at varying times to the bites of mosquitoes carrying the same P. falciparum strain from which the vaccine was derived. The researchers found that the vaccine provided malaria protection for more than one year in 55 percent of people without prior malaria infection. The findings were published in the journal Nature Medicine. In those individuals, the vaccine appeared to confer sterile protection, meaning the individuals would be protected against disease and could not further transmit malaria. The vaccinations were also well-tolerated among participants, and there were no serious adverse events attributed to vaccination, said the study.</text>

	<text>Washington: A new non-invasive, personalised 3D virtual heart assessment tool is the new discovery to help doctors determine if a patient faces a risk of life-threatening arrhythmia. "Our virtual heart test significantly outperformed several existing clinical metrics in predicting future arrhythmic events," said Natalia Trayanova from Johns Hopkins University in the US. Researchers formed its predictions by using the distinctive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records of patients who had survived a heart attack but were left with damaged cardiac tissue that predisposes the heart to deadly arrhythmias. If electrical waves run amok in arrhythmia, sudden death can occur, said researchers. "This non-invasive and personalised virtual heart-risk assessment could help prevent sudden cardiac deaths and allow patients who are not at risk to avoid unnecessary defibrillator implantations," said Trayanova. The study involved data from 41 patients who had survived a heart attack and had an ejection fraction - a measure of how much blood is being pumped out of the heart - of less than 35 per cent. Researchers used a pre-implant MRI scans of the recipients' hearts to build patient-specific digital replicas of the organs. Using computer-modeling techniques, the geometrical replica of each patient's heart was brought to life by incorporating representations of the electrical processes in the cardiac cells and the communication among cells. In some cases, the virtual heart developed an arrhythmia, and in others it did not. The result, a non-invasive way to gauge the risk of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia, was dubbed VARP, short for virtual-heart arrhythmia risk predictor, researchers said. The method allowed the researchers to factor in the geometry of the patient's heart, the way electrical waves move through it and the impact of scar tissue left by the earlier heart attack. "We demonstrated that VARP is better than any other arrhythmia prediction method that is out there," said Trayanova. "By accurately predicting which patients are at risk of sudden cardiac death, the VARP approach will provide the doctors with a tool to identify those patients who truly need the costly implantable device, and those for whom the device would not provide any life-saving benefits," she said. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The online world may be full of risky situations for teens, but allowing them to gradually build their own coping strategies may be a better strategy than forbidding internet use, scientists say. For the two-month study, researchers recruited 68 teens, ages 13- to 17- years old, to enter first-hand accounts of their online experiences in a web-based diary. The experiences were divided into four risk categories - information breaches, online harassment, sexual solicitations and exposure to explicit content, researchers said. The teens reported that they encountered 207 risky events - 119 reports of exposure to explicit content, 31 information breaches, 29 sexual solicitations and 28 incidents of online harassment, they said. However, in many cases, teens were able to resolve the issues on their own. While the media may continue to focus on cases of online risk that had tragic consequences, the diary entries showed that many teens routinely handle some risky situations on their own. "Focusing on the more positive interactions dealing with online risk flips this debate on its head and turns the conversation from one of parents trying to keep their teens safe to maybe there is more we can do to teach teens how to keep themselves safe," said Pamela Wisniewski, formerly from Pennsylvania State University in the US. "Teens, in fact, did not see much of a difference between online risks and the risks they encounter in real-life social settings," said Wisniewski, who now works at the University of Central Florida. "As adults we see these online situations as problems, as negative risk experiences, but teens see them as par-for-the-course experiences," she added. Researchers suggest that teens may be better off gradually acclimating to online risk and building resilience by overcoming lower risk situations, rather than avoiding exposure to risks, which is a more commonly recommended tactic today. Parents and caretakers can act as guides in the process, researchers said. "In the past, we tended to focus on the higher risk events, not the medium risk events, but I think there is a missed opportunity for learning some of the coping strategies that teens use in lower risk situations," said Wisniewski. "So, if they are exposed to a higher risk event, they may be able to exercise some of the skills they already learned," she said. Avoiding the internet is not a realistic option for most teens. According to a 2015 Pew Research Centre survey, 92 per cent of teens have access to the internet daily and 89 per cent have at least one active social media account, researchers said.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The government has proposed eight per cent hike in budget for space research during 2016-17, Lok Sabha was informed on Wednesday. The proposed budget stands at Rs 7,509.14 crore. Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Jitendra Singh made the remark while responding to queries pertaining to amount of money spent on space research and whether government mulls increasing the allocations. "The government proposes to increase the budget for space research to Rs 7,509.14 crore during 2016-17. This amount is about eight per cent increase compared to the revised estimate allocations made during 2015-16," Singh said. Answering another query, the minister said the government spent Rs 5,168.95 crore, Rs 5,823.45 crore and Rs 6,919.87 crore during 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. On being asked whether the government proposes to open new space research centre, Singh replied in negative. He also informed that the country has 24 space research centres at 15 locations including Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore and Ahmedabad.</text>

	<text>Miami: Experiments done on lab mice have revealed how the Zika virus travels through the bloodstream, multiplies in the placenta and invades the brain of the developing fetus, stunting growth or causing death, researchers said Wednesday. The study, published in the journal Cell, could help scientists better understand the mosquito-borne infection and develop vaccines to prevent it. "This is the first demonstration in an animal model of in utero transmission of Zika virus, and it shows some of the same outcomes we've been seeing in women and infants," said co-senior author Michael Diamond, a professor of medicine, molecular microbiology and pathology and immunology at Washington University in St. Louis. Mice were infected with a strain of Zika that was 97 percent similar to the kind circulating in Brazil, where thousands of babies are suspected of having been born with unusually small heads -- a condition known as microcephaly -- since last year. In one of the experiments, researchers used female pregnant mice that were genetically engineered to lack the ability fight off Zika. The virus killed most fetuses within a week, the study found. Offspring that survived had severely stunted growth. In another experiment using genetically normal mice, the fetuses did not die but showed impaired growth and neuron damage. The virus's genetic material persisted in fetal bodies and brains though day 16 of gestation, a critical period for brain development. In neither experiment did the mice develop microcephaly, but researchers said this could come down to biological differences between people and mice. "Unlike in humans, a significant amount of neurodevelopment in mice actually occurs after birth, especially in the cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain damaged in microcephaly," Diamond said. But researchers were particularly intrigued by the way Zika expanded inside the placenta, an organ that develops inside the uterus during pregnancy and nourishes the fetus. Levels of Zika virus in the mouse placentas were 1,000 times greater than in the blood of pregnant mice. "Most of the time, the placenta is an effective barrier between the mother and her fetus. But Zika is able to overcome it," said Indira Mysorekar, aco-senior author from Washington University School of Medicine. "We see the virus in the fetal blood vessel lining and then in circulation, and soon after, we see that it's able to go to the brain." Researchers say they hope their findings could be used to test experimental vaccines for effectiveness, and also therapeutics that may be able to stop the chain of transmission from mother to fetus.</text>

	<text>Washington D.C.: In a new study published on PLOS ONE website, it has been revealed that the Bene Israel community in the western part of India carries genetic proof of the Jewish roots. The community too has identified itself as Jewish. "Almost nothing is known about the Bene Israel community before the 18th century, when Cochin Jews and later Christian missionaries first came into contact with it," says researcher Yedael Waldman. "Beyond vague oral history and speculations, there has been no independent support for Bene Israel claims of Jewish ancestry, claims that have remained shrouded in legend," he added. "Human genetics now has the potential to not only improve human health but also help us understand human history," says another reasearcher Prof. Eran Halperin. According to their oral history, the Bene Israel people descended from 14 Jewish survivors of a shipwreck on India's Konkan shore. The exact timing of this event and the origin and identity of the Jewish visitors are unknown. Some date the event to around 2,000 years ago. Others estimate that it took place in 175 BCE. But others still believe their Jewish ancestors arrived as early as the 8th century BCE. The research team based their study on data from the Jewish HapMap project, an international effort led by Prof. Harry Ostrer of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, to determine the genetic history of worldwide Jewish diasporas. They used sophisticated genetic tools to conduct comprehensive genome-wide analyses on the genetic markers of 18 Bene Israel individuals.</text>

	<text>Boston: Scientists, including those of Indian-origin, have developed a new material that can temporarily tighten skin, smooth wrinkles, and may be used to deliver drugs to treat skin conditions such as eczema. The material, a silicone-based polymer that may be applied on the skin as a thin, imperceptible coating, mimics the mechanical and elastic properties of healthy, youthful skin. In tests with human subjects, the researchers found that the material was able to reshape "eye bags" under the lower eyelids and also enhance skin hydration. This type of "second skin" could also be adapted to provide long-lasting ultraviolet protection, researchers said. "It's an invisible layer that can provide a barrier, provide cosmetic improvement, and potentially deliver a drug locally to the area that's being treated," said Daniel Anderson, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As skin ages, it becomes less firm and less elastic - problems that can be exacerbated by sun exposure. This impairs skin's ability to protect against extreme temperatures, toxins, microorganisms, radiation, and injury. The researchers, including Alpesh Patel, formerly at US-based beauty company Living Proof, and Nithin Ramadurai from Olivo Laboratories, set out to develop a protective coating that could restore the properties of healthy skin, for both medical and cosmetic applications. They created a library of more than 100 possible polymers, all of which contained a chemical structure known as siloxane - a chain of alternating atoms of silicon and oxygen. These polymers can be assembled into a network arrangement known as a cross-linked polymer layer (XPL). The researchers then tested the materials in search of one that would best mimic the appearance, strength, and elasticity of healthy skin. The best-performing material has elastic properties very similar to those of skin. It easily returned to its original state after being stretched more than 250 per cent (natural skin can be elongated about 180 per cent). In laboratory tests, the novel XPL's elasticity was much better than that of two other types of wound dressings now used on skin - silicone gel sheets and polyurethane films. The researchers performed several studies in humans to test the material's safety and effectiveness. In one study, the XPL was applied to the under-eye area where "eye bags" often form as skin ages. The material applied a steady compressive force that tightened the skin, an effect that lasted for about 24 hours. In another study, the XPL was applied to forearm skin to test its elasticity. When the XPL-treated skin was distended with a suction cup, it returned to its original position faster than untreated skin. The researchers also tested the material's ability to prevent water loss from dry skin. Two hours after application, skin treated with the novel XPL suffered much less water loss than skin treated with a high-end commercial moisturiser. The research was published in the journal Nature Materials.</text>

	<text>TOKYO: After analyzing a 3D map of 3,000 galaxies that are 13 billion light years from Earth, an international team led by Japanese researchers has found that theoretical physicist Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity is still valid. Since it was discovered in the late 1990s that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, scientists have been trying to explain why. The mysterious dark energy could be driving acceleration, or Einstein's theory of general relativity, which says gravity warps space and time, could be breaking down. "We tested the theory of general relativity further than anyone else ever has. It's a privilege to be able to publish our results 100 years after Einstein proposed his theory," said project researcher Teppei Okumura from Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics (Kavli IPMU) at University of Tokyo. To test Einstein's theory, the team led by Okumura and colleagues, with researchers from Tohoku University and Kyoto University, used "Fast Sound Survey" data on more than 3,000 distant galaxies to analyze their velocities and clustering. The results indicated that even far into the universe, general relativity is valid, giving further support that the expansion of the universe could be explained by a cosmological constant as proposed by Einstein in his theory of general relativity. "Having started this project 12 years ago, it gives me great pleasure to finally see this result come out," added Karl Glazebrook, professor at Swinburne University of Technology who proposed the survey. No one has been able to analyse galaxies more than 10 billion light years away but the team managed to break this barrier thanks to the FMOS (Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph) on the Subaru Telescope which can analyse galaxies 12.4-14.7 billion light years away. The details of the study were published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan.</text>

	<text>THANE: The weather department has predicted nearly 25 percent more rainfall for Thane district following which the administration here has already stepped up disaster management plans to ensure any emergency is tackled efficiently. District collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar held a co-ordination meeting with corporations in Thane on Wednesday to get an idea of the disaster mitigation plans before the monsoons. He asked all civic bodies to complete survey of all dilapidated structures in their respective zones by May 25 to avoid any emergency situation during the incoming monsoon season. "A coordination team will be deputed at the district headquarters that will also seek help from cadets in times of emergencies. Adequate staff will be deployed to identify possible flooding situations in the district especially flood prone villages during July and August when the rains will be in full force," said Kalyankar. Corporations have been asked to clean up all drains passing through their jurisdictions and also survey all dilapidated buildings before May 25. The state has already set guidelines for identifying and taking action on such structures. The district witnessed two building collapses last monsoons, one at Thane and other at Thakurli that claimed several lives. Meanwhile, the TMC has started work on cleaning nullahs last week and has completed survey of dilapidated buildings in around three ward committees. Around 44 structures are believed to have been identified as extremely dangerous for stay.</text>

	<text>SRINAGAR: Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has revealed that he and his team-mates skipped dinner after their gut-wrenching one-run defeat against India in the recently concluded World T20. Mortaza, who is holidaying in Kashmir, interacted with the local youngsters. "We were very upset with that defeat. None of us had dinner that evening. Losing is a part of the game and we did not want to lose that match," Mortaza was quoted as saying by a local website, when a local boy asked about Bangladesh not being able to score two runs off the last three balls during their group league encounter against India. It was a chance encounter for the locals with the Bangladeshi captain as he stopped by at a village on Srinagar-Sonamarg road on Sunday. "On his way back to summer capital (Srinagar) from Sonamarg, he saw a few youngsters playing cricket at Kullan. Mortaza stopped the vehicle and met the players," the website report stated. The seamer gave some tips to the young players and even displayed his skills by bowling a few deliveries.</text>

	<text>The Asia Cup will be played for the first time in a Twenty20 format. Pakistan bowling legend Wasim Akram, who is in Bangladesh to do commentary for Star Sports, says he's looking forward to the India-Pakistan clash and the tournament. Excerpts from an interview: India and Pakistan will finally get to face each other in the Asia Cup... Yes, that'll be a good game to look forward to and given the way India are playing right now, they're clear favourites. The Asia Cup, this year, assumes a lot of significance particularly because of the Twenty20 format that it'll be played in. It was a very sensible decision on part of the Asian Cricket Council. Out of the last three World T20 champions, three are participating in this Asia Cup, so that quotient alone adds so much excitement to the tournament. Then, Bangladesh have been an unbeatable side at home. This edition has a lot of potential and will help teams pick their best combinations for World T20. The Indian pace bowling has been a struggling unit. Either injuries or lack of direction... The primary reason is that India has failed to guard its bowlers. First of all, there are just too many people that a bowler is talking to. The BCCI has to be very strict about it and clearly tell the bowlers that they can only go to a certain academy or a BCCI-appointed coach and over there they should interact only with specified coaches with regards to their bowling. The more you start taking advice from multiple people, the more likely you are to enter a state of confusion. I strongly feel that's exactly what happened with Irfan Pathan. the last six or seven years there've been so many Indian bowlers who, when they arrive at the international stage, bowl at 140-145 kmph and in a year or two, the pace just dips. How healthy a sign is it when bowlers try different things without the right guidance? I'm all for changing actions. But what's more important for me is that if a bowler's got pace and can swing the ball, then I won't mess with his action. Because that action has been part of the bowler's regimen for a while and the muscles have got accustomed to that action. If you change the action, you not only stand to lose pace but the swing too. You shortened your run-up after settling down at international level... Yes, I shortened my run up long after I had settled down in international cricket. 1987 to be precise. Please remember that there was someone like Imran Khan around when I did that. But let me tell you that it was me who realised it about my action than someone else telling me. I realised I was taking 25 strides to the crease and bowling at a certain pace or managing to swing the ball which I could do with just 20 strides. Mohd Shami is struggling with his fitness... I can say I have some idea of fast bowling (sic). When I came to know that Shami was making a comeback for the tour of Australia last month, I told one of my co-commentators, I think it was Harsha, 'You wait and watch, this guy will probably pull his hamstring'. That's because the pressure of bowling in a practice game or in the nets or in a domestic game is different and the pressure of bowling in an international match is different. You need to properly play a full season of first class cricket after a knee injury before international cricket. A fast bowler has got to keep thinking for himself... Exactly. You're bowling on a flat wicket. There are two settled batsmen at the crease. What do you do? Simple, use your brains...look at the conditions, look at the situation and apply your mind. How would you put it in Hindi or Urdu, chalaaki (cunningness?)...you have to fox the batsman. Does a format like Twenty20 allow you that space to think? If it's the last ball of a Twenty20 match, many times the bowler is mentally prepared that he's going to be hit for a four or a six. And yet, you see bowlers bowling the middle line or the middle and leg. For me, the last ball of an innings was the most important delivery of an innings. Has the bowler failed to innovate in cricket like the batsman has? First of all, reverse swing has completely gone out of the picture. Reverse swing is an art that has not been preserved. It's an art cultivated not just by the bowler but an entire team. It's not rocket science but nobody wants to apply mind to it. Nobody will hand you a 'prepared' ball. You just have to see if it's a dry square and after six-odd overs tell your team to give you (the bowler) a one-bounce throw. If the ball lands on the rough side, it'll rough up further and you see the signs of the ball reversing a bit, you give a shout to your teammates to 'look after the ball'. How do you then look after the ball? You just let the rough side be and keep shining the smoother side. Only one guy should shine the ball, not the whole team. Zaheer was the last of Indian bowlers who reached the next level? Zaheer Khan was the last Indian bowler who managed to create this balance. He became a very intelligent bowler over a period of time. He tried different things. He got a good hang of the reverse swing. He would hide the shining side of the ball, like I did, when he ran in to bowl. Nobody told Zaheer all this. He learnt this by himself. Umesh Yadav has good pace but doesn't seem to be doing things the right way... I always liked his action but I don't think he had any mentor in this team. When I was inexperienced, I needed someone at mid-on or mid-off to constantly keep talking to me. I'm lucky I had Imran around. Later, there was Waqar, then Shoaib and it was about constantly talking to each other. Unfortunately, the Indian bowlers have always missed out on that. When they get hit, they don't know what to do. They just end up fending for themselves. Are Indian bowlers missing out on the county experience? It's okay if the Indian players can't play Twenty20 in England. But missing out on the county experience is a pity. I played a full 10 years for Lancashire. My stint at Lancashire allowed me to adapt to various things as a bowler which I couldn't have learnt playing first-class cricket in Pakistan. You say Lancashire stint helped you more than anything else. Can you talk us through that experience? In Lancashire, I used to spend most of my time alone. I used to go to the ground, 'prepare' my own ball and try my hand at reverse swing for hours and hours alone. There used to be this Sussex batsman Gehan Mendis. I used to take him to the nets and make him face the bowling. All my teammates used to say, 'Are you crazy? You've got an entire season in front of you. Don't exhaust yourself'. And I would tell them, 'Mate, I'm just 21. You don't get tired at 21. You only improve.' Bowlers can bloom late in their careers, like Zaheer... Of course. Zaheer learnt it by himself and the confidence showed in his bowling. I did the same. That's what I'd like to tell the youngsters of today. Close your eyes and picture Malcolm Marshall. Personally, I grew up with a mental state of mind that I had to bowl like Joel Garner. I never knew what a gym was till very late. I just ran and ran and ran and bowled.</text>

	<text>MIRPUR: Pakistan failed to fire at the Asia Cup but skipper Shahid Afridi believes his side can make amends at the upcoming World T20. In a chat with TOI, Afridi spoke about his team's chances, the innings he played in the 2009 World T20 final at Lord's and more. Excerpts: How would you rate Pakistan's chances at the World T20? Look, we made too many mistakes in this competition. Our batting hasn't fired and you can't win matches if you lose quick wickets right at the start of play. The middle-order and our bowling did keep us in the hunt, especially in matches against Bangladesh and India, but it wasn't enough. I still believe we have the team to go the distance (in T20 World Cup). It is a format where our boys have done well. We will have to do something special to make a mark because we are in a tough group with the likes of India, Australia and New Zealand. Mohammad Amir's return has been a big boost... Amir has been sensational and bowled his heart out each time he was given the ball. As a skipper, I can't ask for more. There was huge pressure on him when he came back into the side, but he has handled himself well and justified his selection. Having been part of many India-Pakistan clashes over the years, where do you see your side falling short vis-a-vis India which has had an upper hand over you in recent years? I believe India have been able to raise their game in crucial junctures, which we haven't. In the last game against India, we failed to read the pitch and made too many errors that cost us the game. We fought hard and made it tough for them, but when you don't have runs on the board the bowlers can't do much. How much motivation do you derive from your exploits in 2009 at the World T20? Could you share any anecdotes from the knock you played in the final? It was a massive moment not just for the team, but for those at the stadium cheering us, and for the entire nation. On the day of the final, there were butterflies in my stomach. I was supremely confident, and somehow knew we would do well. We didn't have a daunting total to chase, and vividly recall the six I hit against Muttiah Muralitharan towards mid-wicket. Even today, whenever I have some free time I catch that innings of my mine on the internet. That win remains the proudest moment for me till date. How would rate Virat Kohli vis a vis Sachin Tendulkar? I have said this before too - no one should be compared to Sachin Tendulkar. He has been a great role model for millions of Indians and for those who follow the sport across the world. Virat has been a champion player too. He has been consistent over the years and his aggressive nature is great for the game. Both are fantastic cricketers and I wouldn't put one above other. In your opinion, who can be labelled as the best hitter in world cricket today? There are quite a few such as Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, Virat, Glenn Maxwell, David Warner, and of course MS Dhoni among others. On a given day, these players are extremely destructive.</text>

	<text>VIZIANAGARAM: Cheteshwar Pujara has been more of a perfectionist. Before every ball he faces, he makes it a point to check his grip and field placings. It has helped him so far in his career. After a lean patch during England and Australia tour in 2014, Pujara has bounced back strongly and played a major role in team India's twin Test series victory against Sri Lanka and South Africa. Pujara is now eying the Ranji Trophy title and a place in shorter formats in the national team. He has been working hard on various aspects of his game. Pujara spoke to TOI on various aspects. Excerpts from an interview Q: Is it difficult to digest when people say you can't play shorter formats... A: I think it's people's perception that I can't play the shorter formats. They start assuming things because I haven't played that many games for India in shorter formats. You can't say that I can't. I have just played three or four ODIs. If you look at other players, they have got more opportunities. It's a matter of time. With more runs in domestic format this season and possibly in the IPL, you never know things can change. I have spoken to big players Rahul (Dravid) Bhai and Sachin (Tendulkar) Paaji and they also told me that there's nothing wrong with my technique. They also believe that I can play the other formats of the game. I am working on few other shots which have already given me the results in domestic T20. Going ahead, if I have more shots it will be an advantage. Q: Can you elaborate what kind of shots? A: I don't want to disclose the shots because I don't want bowlers to have an idea about them. If I keep on working on different shots, it will create doubts in bowlers' mind. Look at AB De Villiers, he hits every shot from sweep to paddle sweep to reverse sweep to fast bowlers so the bowlers aren't sure what's coming their way. Dravid and Pujara during a practice session. (TOI Photo) Q: Your teammates Virat, Rohit and Ajinkya are playing orthodox shots even in Twenty20. Does it give you confidence that if they can do it, I can also do the same? A; Definitely. If you look at the ODI format, you don't need to accelerate as much as in T20. You can still take your time and once you are set you can play your shots. If you look at my Test innings, lots of the time I start slowly because you need to get set but once I am set I always accelerate and the strike rate is always on the higher side. Overall, in my Test innings the strike rate is always 55-60, which is really good for a normal batsman. If you compare my strike rate with any other batsman at the international level, it's better or at par. I don't want to compare myself with Virender Sehwag or Chris Gayle or AB De Villiers. They are in a different league. But if you compare with other batsmen like Kane Williamson, Joe Root, who are progressing or somebody like Virat, the strike rate is quite similar. At the end of the day, it's not all about strike rate in the Test format, it's about how you have contributed to the team's success and how you are willing to improve. At the international level, it's about improving all the time because at the level you face the different conditions and different challenges. As long as I am progressing, I am really happy. Q: Did you speak to Virender Sehwag about the approach in T20 when you shared dressing room with him in Kings XI Punjab set-up? A: Yes I did and he told me that you have all the shots in the book. It's all about expressing yourself in the middle and be fearless. He told me to work on few areas and that's what I'm doing in One-dayers and Twenty20. Q: You looked aggressive in Test series against South Africa. Was that a conscious effort? It comes naturally. You assess the situation. Sometimes you look to target a particular bowler where you can feel you can accelerate and put pressure on the opposition and score around 100 runs in a session. You analyse the situation and plan accordingly. Q: How difficult was your comeback against Sri Lanka? A: Comebacks are always difficult because there are so many things going on in your mind. Sometimes you feel you might not get another opportunity but when I was making my comeback I thought that the amount of runs I have made at the domestic level and even at the international level...I had more than 2000 runs under my belt. I felt that I needed to stay focussed and keep working on my game, keep improving the areas I needed to work on. When I went into bat in my comeback game I never thought about anything else. I just wanted to watch the ball and play according to the merit of the ball. Every cricketer goes through a phase they don't perform as they should have. The kind of starts I have got at the international level, the expectations were really high because I have scored double hundreds. Whenever I scored hundred those were big scores. So when I was scoring 70s and 80s, nobody was noticing that. That is the past now. I am batting well. I am back in form. I am looking good in the nets. I did well even in domestic T20s. Overall whatever areas I have worked on, it has come out well. I think I am capable of playing ODIs and T20 formats as well. I have worked on those aspects and it has paid off. Somebody was telling me I was fourth or fifth in the run-getters list in T20s. Q: How much that century was a relief for you? A: Somewhere down the line I knew I was capable of scoring runs at the international level and it can be each and every inning. Most of the time, the way I have approached my domestic cricket, every second or third innings, I have scored a hundred. So I believe, I could do the same at the international level. So when I scored hundred I was happy. I won't say I was relieved because at the international level you always want to keep improving because you can't be relaxed that I have scored hundred...I have secured my place. It's not about securing your place. It's always about contributing to the team's success. I bat at No.3 and it's lot of responsibility batting at that position. I need to make sure that team doesn't lose too many wickets early on and If I can get the partnership with another opener, then we have chance of scoring 350-400 runs and if you do that most of the time you wouldn't end up losing the game. Q: What kind of mindset is required when you are playing on those challenging wickets? A: When you play on such wickets you have to be positive. You have to accept that I got a good ball and I couldn't do much about it but you focus in the next innings, focus on the game, especially in the Test matches. If I haven't scored in the first innings, I still have a chance to make amends in the second. The kind of innings I played in Mohali, it was very crucial for us. You have to focus on each and every ball if you are playing on challenging wickets because you can't be relaxed that I am set now. If you are playing on challenging wicket an odd ball can turn or straighten and you end up getting out. So the concentration and focus is required on such wickets. Pressure is always something people talk. How important is to handle it and did you talk to Rahul Dravid on this issue? I had a chat with him during India 'A' series. First of all he told me that there's nothing wrong with my technique, which was a big relief mentally. He has been watching me since I made my Under-19 debut and when I was playing Ranji match against Karnataka. So he knew I am capable of scoring good runs. His advice was really crucial. You have to be really tough mentally at the international level. When you play at that level, there will be sledging and other things. There will be pressure on you by media or people. They want team to win each and every game, which is not very easy. So you still have to accept because there are a lot of emotions attached to it. I look at it in a positive way. When you win, it makes people happy. Recently, when I was travelling and India were playing last Twenty20 match in Australia, the people were glued to TV sets not realising they have a flight to catch. So we have a role to play and that part comes when you are strong mentally.</text>

	<text>CHENNAI: Pace legend Glenn McGrath was part of a world-beating Australian side. Even after his retirement, the Aussies have won the ODI World Cup once, but the T20 World Cup has eluded them so far. McGrath, who is currently in Chennai to train the pacers at the MRF Pace Foundation, spoke about Australia's chances in the forth coming T20 World Cup. Excerpts: Do you think the bowlers have developed new skills to rein in batsmen in T20s? There has been a remarkable change in the way the bowlers are looking to go about their job nowadays. The bowlers have learnt to have better control and the margin of error has reduced. What is safe total in a T20 game? Do you think the mindset of teams while chasing has completely changed? Yes, the current generation shows no fear in chasing big totals. The attitude has changed. Earlier, 200 was a defendable total in 50-0ver games and now 300 is not. With the wickets becoming batsmen friendly, chasing down a big target has become easier. Who, according to you, will be the favourites in the upcoming World T20? India are the favourites. They play the format well and the conditions favourable. They can go all the way. World T20 is the only title that has eluded Australia... It can happen anytime as Australia take their T20 games very seriously .Australia generally play well in Indian conditions and I am sure they'll play with a lot confidence this time. Have you seen India's Bumrah during the Australia series? What do you have to say about his unusual action? Yes, I feel that the batsmen will keep facing difficulties in handling Bumrah if he consistently bowls those yorkers. He has got an unusual action and batsmen will need time to adjust to it. Bumrah trained here two years back and has improved a lot. How do you evaluate Steven Smith's rise? I am a big fan of Smith. He is not the conventional cricketer. Technically he may not be as good as others but he gets you the results, which is more important. I love his attitude and he is a very tough guy to bowl to. Skills can only get a batsman to a certain level. Attitude can make you a great cricketer and Smith has plenty of it. Do you endorse Shane Warne's comment on Steve Waugh that he was a selfish captain? (Smiles) They are excellent players and both are good friends of mine. As a captain, you have to take some tough decisions. Steve has been a great captain and has led the team by example. But yes, people comment differently and it was Shane's personal opinion. I must thank Shane for helping me form a good partnership and help me take so many wickets. Just like batsmen, we bowlers too have to bowl in tandem and I am lucky to have enjoyed a great partnership with Warne.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: As an off-spinner, New Zealand's John Bracewell would not have turned too many heads in his heydays. But it is the 57-year-old's ability as a cricket coach that has left an impressive imprint on the sport. In his coaching experience of over 30 years, Bracewell first guided English county side Gloucestershire to multiple one-day trophies and then played a big role in shaping the new-look New Zealand outfit from 2007 onwards. He dubbed himself a 'mad scientist' because he was never afraid to innovate. Bracewell is now coaching the Ireland national team and his first assignment is to guide them through the qualifying rounds of the ICC World T20. Excerpts from an exclusive interview... Q. You have billed yourself as a 'mad scientist' for your techniques as a coach. Can you elaborate? That statement has to be taken in context. What I meant was that I threw innovative ideas at others like a 'mad scientist'. Take for example, during my second stint with Gloucestershire, I employed a 'power-hitting' coach Julian Wood for the first time because I understood it's importance in the T20 era. I have never been afraid as a coach to initiate innovativeness and never missed a chance to take a gamble. Q. How would you analyse you three stints as coach with Gloucestershire, New Zealand and now Ireland? They were all at different points of time when coaching methodology was very different. In my first stint with Gloucestershire, all I had was an analyst and support staff and it was the same with New Zealand. Ireland is a fresh experience as we have a young group of players with limited budget and resources. The aim here is to create a good team and hopefully ensure a full-member status. Q. Talking about limited resources, what more does Ireland need to develop as a team? The first thing we need in place is an 'A' programme which every full-member country has. In addition to it, we need personalised nets and training facility. The practice facilities in Dharamshala are just fantastic and way above anything we have back home in Ireland. Q. After Ireland's performances in the 2011 and 2015 50-over World Cup, Ireland are no longer surprise packages. Do you think this is a disadvantage? I expect this team to work like a unit. Someone like a Chris Gayle usually only wins a couple of games in a tournament. We need a couple of batters to click in a couple of games. There is genuine quality in the World T20 qualifiers and we are aware that we need to win three games to ensure qualification for the main event which is a tough ask. The addition of Boyd Rankin is very important because he has genuine pace. We have to remember that Boyd has been a Test cricketer - he has even taken part in an Ashes series. Q. In your stint with New Zealand, what was your philosophy in dealing with someone like Brendon McCullum? I have developed my coaching philosophy over a long time - over 30 years. Brendon (McCullum) is a very different player, the kind you get once in a generation. You have to give them a chance to spread their wings and that's what I did. See how Brendon spread his wings and dominated world cricket. Q. You played cricket in the company of legends like Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee. How would you sum up contribution of someone like Crowe to New Zealand cricket? I have the utmost respect for Martin. He and Richard were the two world-class cricketers in an otherwise working-class team. They set the benchmark for New Zealand cricket, professionalised it even. It was because of someone like Crowe that we were able to earn money from playing cricket. He has laid a platform from which every cricketer including McCullum has benefited.</text>

	<Heading>Let transgender students use bathroom of choice: US to schools</Heading>
	<time_cap>Reuters | May 14, 2016, 09.34 AM IST</time_cap>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The Obama administration told US public schools on Friday that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority. Conservatives pushed back against the administration's non-binding guidance to schools, the latest battleground in the issue of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton said the guidance "must be challenged." "If President Obama thinks he can bully Texas schools into allowing men to have open access to girls in bathrooms, he better prepare for yet another legal fight," Paxton, a Tea Party champion, said in a statement. Other Republican-led states joined calls to disregard the White House's directive and accused the administration of overstepping its role. In North Carolina, governor Pat McCrory labeled the move a "massive executive branch overreach" and called on federal courts and the US Congress to intercede, while Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said it was "offensive, intrusive and totally lacking in common sense." The US education and justice departments, in a letter, told school districts nationwide that while the guidance carries no legal weight, they must not discriminate against students, including based on their gender identity. The guidance contained an implicit threat that school districts defying the Obama administration's interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or be deprived of federal aid. The White House defended its actions, saying the guidance should not be viewed as a threat but instead as a set of "specific, tangible, real-world advice and suggestions" that many schools had sought and will welcome. "That's what we're looking for: solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in school," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing, adding that the idea was to prevent discrimination against a range of groups extending beyond the transgender community. The directive came as the Justice Department and North Carolina are battling in federal court over a North Carolina state law approved in March that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, while other states weigh similar measures. North Carolina's law was the first to ban people from restrooms in public buildings and schools not matching the sex on their birth certificate. Mississippi has enacted legislation similarly viewed as discriminatory by civil and gay rights groups, and Tennessee and Missouri considered similar measures. The letter to the schools from Washington said that, to get federal funding under existing rules, a school has to agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating a transgender student differently from other students of the same gender identity, officials said. The American Civil Liberties Union said the guidance would help make students "free to bring their whole selves to school." In a sign of what defiant states may face, the Justice Department this week asked a US district court in North Carolina to declare the state in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and order it to stop enforcing the ban. Americans are divided over which public restrooms should be used by transgender people, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, with 44 percent saying people should use them according to their biological sex and 39 percent saying they should be used according to the gender with which they identify. A group representing US school boards called the guidance "unsettled law." "A dispute about the intent of the federal law must ultimately be resolved by the courts and the Congress," the National School Boards Association said in a statement. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was less critical than many of his party in several television interviews, saying the issue should be left up to individual states. "Everybody has to be protected ... but it's a tiny, tiny portion of the population," Trump told Fox News.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Donald Trump has dominated the Twitter battle for the White House by insulting and belittling his rivals, but he has found a formidable social media opponent in the fiery senator and potential Democratic vice presidential pick Elizabeth Warren. While Hillary Clinton prefers to ignore the attacks of her Republican adversary Trump, who blasts the former secretary of state as "crooked," Warren has no qualms about wading into the fray. The first-term lawmaker from Massachusetts and former Harvard law professor has successfully harnessed social media, in particular Twitter, as a medium for punching out at The Donald. He parries, or counterpunches with 140-character-or-less blows of his own. She jabs him with bursts of ruthless tweets. The mud-slinging began in earnest on May 3, when Trump's rivals quit the race and he emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee. I'm going to fight my heart out to make sure @realDonaldTrump's toxic stew of hatred &amp; insecurity never reaches the White House.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 4, 2016 Warren is a liberal Democrat with a passionate following. Many supporters have urged her since 2014 to run for president, although she declined to enter this year's contest. In her anti-Trump Twitter storm she denounced the candidate as one who "incites supporters to violence, praises Putin," says he is "cool with being called an authoritarian," and "puts our servicemembers at risk by cheerleading illegal torture." .@realDonaldTrump incites supporters to violence, praises Putin, and is "cool with being called an authoritarian."  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 4, 2016 "What happens next will test the character for all of us -- Republican, Democrat, and Independent," she added. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 4, 2016 Trump, whose belligerent bluster has earned him 8.1 million Twitter followers -- Warren has a million -- has taken to branding his rivals with pithy but obnoxious labels like "Little Marco" Rubio and "Lyin' Ted" Cruz. He now trains his fire on the Democrats, labeling the White House contenders "Crooked Hillary" and "Crazy Bernie" Sanders. Recently he piled criticism on Warren, unveiling a new nickname. I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 6, 2016 Warren shot back with Trump-like swagger, and the war of words was on. "Goofy," @realDonaldTrump? For a guy with "the best words" that's a pretty lame nickname. Weak!  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016 Trump then dug up a tiff about Warren's ancestry, repeating conservative accusations that she does not have Native American blood as she has claimed, a controversy that arose during her successful 2012 Senate campaign. Warren retorted by calling the New York real estate tycoon "a bully who has a single play in his playbook -- offensive lies thrown at anyone who calls him out." Trump "spews insults and lies" in order to avoid honest discussion about issues that are important to Americans, she said. Whatever @realDonaldTrump says, we won't shut up. We won't back down. This election is too important, &amp; he won't step foot in White House.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016 Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2016 After a days-long truce, the attacks resumed before the bemused eyes of millions -- in a showdown resembling a reality show more than a presidential campaign. On Wednesday Trump struck first, unloading a string of crude tweets including one that assailed Warren's "phony Native American heritage" and said she "didn't have the guts" to run for president. Warren, who has yet to announce her support of either Clinton or Sanders, and has declined to say whether she would accept an offer to be Clinton's running mate, refused to let up. We get it, @realDonaldTrump: When a woman stands up to you, you're going to call her a basket case. Hormonal. Ugly.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 11, 2016 Warren has launched pointed, specific criticism of the billionaire's past business deals, his stance on Wall Street or the minimum wage, and accused him of "scamming students" who enrolled in his now-defunct Trump University. .@realDonaldTrump: Your policies are dangerous. Your words are reckless. Your record is embarrassing. And your free ride is over.  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 11, 2016</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The US is committed to maintaining its "important" and "vital" relationship with Pakistan, the Obama Administration said Saturday amid reports of strains in bilateral ties. "It is an important, vital relationship that we strongly believe in. Is it complicated at times? Absolutely it is. And do we see eye-to-eye on every issue with Pakistan? No, we don't," State Department spokesman, John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference. "But that's why the relationship matters so much because we have shared threats and shared concerns, shared interests in the region. And we're going to continue to work at it," he said. Kirby was responding to a question on the statement made by Prime Minister's Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz that his country's relationship with the United States has been under stress for the past three months. Kirby said he has not seen the statement. "I didn't see his comments. So I'm going to refrain from responding specifically to that sentiment," he said. Kirby did not agree when asked if the US-Pakistan ties are not at the best of times these days. "It is an important relationship that we continue to work at very, very seriously. We're going to remain committed to. And I would not share that characterization of it," Kirby said.</text>

	<text>A seaman whose quick actions aboard a lifeboat are credited with saving passengers during the Titanic's sinking will finally receive a headstone on his grave, nearly 75 years after his death. Titanic enthusiasts from around the world are expected to join members of Robert Hopkins' family at Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Saturday as a black granite headstone bearing his name is unveiled and blessed. Hopkins' body has rested in the unmarked grave since his death in 1943. His act of heroism on the night of April 14, 1912, has been long forgotten, except for those who closely study the Titanic's ill-fated maiden voyage in which 1,512 of the 2,225 passengers and crew died when the ship sank in the icy North Atlantic Ocean. The able seaman was asleep in his bunk when Titanic hit an iceberg. He was assigned to help load and launch lifeboats, which could only handle 1,178 people. First Officer William Murdoch, who was on the wheelhouse when the collision occurred, ordered Hopkins to board Lifeboat 13, which was carrying many third-class passengers, said Titanic International Society co-founder and President Charles Haas. Hopkins' boat was lowered below Lifeboat 15, which was descending. It looked as though Lifeboat 15 would land on top of Hopkins' boat. "Hopkins, from what we've seen, called up and told them to stop lowering. He and another crew member went to work with a pen knife to cut the ropes," Haas said. "If Hopkins had not done what he did, 13 and potentially 15, would have been lost." Afterhis rescue, Hopkins returned to sea and later became a longshoreman in Hoboken, across the Hudson River from the pier in lower Manhattan where Titanic was supposed to have docked, according to the Titanic International Society. When the society decided to hold this year's annual convention in Newark, it made arrangements to visit Holy Name Cemetery, where Hopkins and four other survivors including two who were aboard Lifeboat 13 are buried. The group mentioned that his grave was unmarked. "When I realized one was unmarked, I immediately offered to provide a headstone at no cost, with permission from Newark Archbishop John Myers," said Andrew P. Schafer, executive director of Catholic Cemeteries. The Titanic group tracked down Hopkins' four grandchildren, who had known as youngsters that their grandfather was a Titanic survivor. "My father told me his father did not talk much about it," said his granddaughter, Virginia Hopkins. The Brooklyn, New York, resident will be joined by her three brothers, their children and other relatives when the headstone is unveiled. "It's a great honour," she said.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Police are looking for three teens in the US who skipped school to live-stream themselves engaging in sex acts on Facebook to their classmates, a media report said. On January 14, 2016, four juvenile students viewed a livestream on the social media website using their cell phones during health class at 1 p.m. The students said the videos show a 14-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy engaging in sex acts, the report added. Police in Milwaukee city of the US are asking Facebook to hand over all the information it has on the account of a 14-year-old girl. From pictures, status history and videos to user information like name, email, and IP address, a report on CBS58.com said. Meanwhile, Milwaukee Public Schools released a statement saying in January, staff became aware of a video depicting inappropriate conduct that took place outside of school and off campus. "The school immediately notified proper authorities and cooperated with the investigation. We took appropriate disciplinary action against those involved, which would be in addition to any outside consequences they may face," the statement said. A Milwaukee County search warrant notes that the two juvenile girls in the video could be charged with "exposing a child to harmful material" while the 15-year-old boy that participated in the sexual acts was not listed as a suspect on the warrant. The video was viewed by students at Barack Obama School but was not filmed there. The two girls in the videos attend the school but according to the school principal, the two suspects skipped school after the first period, the report said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: US First Lady Michelle Obama stunned in Indian-American fashion designer Naeem Khan's creation on Friday at the state dinner hosted by US President Barack Obama in honour of leaders from Nordic countries. Michelle wore a blush-coloured gown by the New York based designer which featured a bodice, full skirt and one-shoulder detailing. Naeem Khan has been one of the favorite designers of Mrs Obama, as she first wore his creation to her first state dinner back in 2009. The state dinner is usually for one Head of State. However, the President honoured five countries this time, including Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Norway. "She looks great," Obama said complementing his wife as they welcomed the guests at the North Portico of the White House. "He stepped on my dress," quipped the US first lady. Popular Indian-American actor and comedian Aziz Ansari attended the dinner along with his mother Fatima Ansari. Celebrities like Miranda Kerr, Tracee Ellis Ross, Al Roker, Connie Britton, David Letterman and Will Ferrell were also present. This was Obama's 12th State Dinner after he hosted the inaugural one for the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November 2009.</text>

	<text>Donald Trump said on Friday that he doesn't believe voters have a right to see his tax returns, and insisted it's "none of your business" when pressed on what tax rate he himself pays  a question that tripped up Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. Trump made the comments in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America," as he continued to try to answer questions about his change in explanations over the last year about why he won't release the taxes. When the interviewer, George Stephanopoulos, asked Trump directly if he thought voters had a right to see his returns, something that presidential nominees have provided for roughly 40 years, the candidate replied, "I don't think they do." Trump added: "But I do say this, I will really gladly give them  not going to learn anything but it's under routine audit. When the audit ends I'll present them. That should be before the election. I hope it's before the election." When asked what effective tax rate he pays, Trump said: "It's none of your business. You'll see it when I release, but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible." Romney, who is also a businessman, delayed releasing many of his returns until September 2012, at which point they showed an effective tax rate that was much lower than most Americans pay. Trump has said in the last few years that Romney erred in waiting so long and should have done it sooner. Also during the interview, Stephanopoulos pointed out that the Internal Revenue Service has said being audited is not prohibitive in terms of individual choice to make tax returns public, and that President Richard M. Nixon did so when he was being audited. But Trump insisted that "people will learn nothing." "I put in financials, 100 pages worth of financials, that show that I built a company that's worth more than $10 billion," Trump said. "It shows cash. It shows cash flows. It shows everything. You learn very little from tax returns but nevertheless, when the audit is complete, I will release. I have no problem with it." He said he has no offshore accounts that would be discovered. Trump conceded that he released tax returns under audit over a decade ago when he was seeking a casino license, but said, "At the time it didn't make any difference to me, now it does." Democrats have treaded lightly on the issue of Trump's tax returns in the last week, as Hillary Clinton faces pressure to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs. Trump pointed to her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches in his interview with Stephanopoulos. But there is no tradition for releasing transcripts of paid speeches, whereas the tradition of presidential candidates releasing tax returns stretches back decades. And Trump has faced questions repeatedly about whether he is worth what he claims to be. "So you've got to ask yourself, why doesn't he want to release them?" Clinton said at a campaign event Wednesday. "Yeah, well, we're going to find out." She and her husband have released their taxes going back to 1977, when he first entered political life. At minimum for Trump, the returns would help establish his level of liquidity. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee claims to have enough money to keep lending his campaign funds if he chooses to. Trump's allies insist that comparing his taxes to Clinton's is unfair, since he has a private business. But he is not the first businessman ever to run for public office, and most have found ways to make their tax information available, even in redacted form. The good-government group Common Cause put out a statement calling on Trump to release the taxes, pointing out that he released under-audit versions in the early 2000s to gaming commissions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Trump has given different explanations for why he wouldn't release his taxes over the years. In 2011, when he contemplated running for president, Trump said he would release his tax returns when President Barack Obama released his birth certificate. Obama made the birth certificate public in April 2011, and Trump announced a few weeks later that he would not run for president. Last year, Trump said he was still considering whether to release the returns, but he made no mention of the audits until this year.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: India and the US have formed a Brain Trust aimed at deepening and strengthening cooperation between the best and brightest in the scientific community of the world's two largest democracies. The partnership between the Indian and American scientific community, researchers, academicians, businesses and entrepreneurs is a "win-win" for not only the two countries, but also the entire world, said Indian ambassador to the US Arun K Singh. "We find now a strategic convergence in our interest and we are working together in different areas," he said in his address at the inaugural dinner of the Indo-US Brain Trust here on Thursday. A partnership for research and development and scientific collaboration is essential to take this relationship to the next level, he said. "There is a huge potential there," he added. "Several major US companies have developed products in India, which their CEOs have said to me they could not have developed in the US because researchers and scientists here approach the problem from different perspective with different resource availability, they are targeting with different objective," Singh said. "Whereas in India the aim very often is to minimize the use of resources, keep the cost down, maximize the number of people that can be reached through the product and thereby you end up with something that is different and has relevance in a different context," he said. Applauding India's success, former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said India has now emerged as a model for other developing countries. "The idea is to create a platform- which partners scientific minds from both countries to explore and create timely solutions to pressing global challenges," said Ron Somers founder and CEO of India First Group welcoming the guests at the inaugural dinner. "The Indo-US Brain Trust must strive to create a shared platform for the US and Indian scientific communities to exchange, synergize, and deepen collaboration," he added. Dr Krishna K Banaudha, an Indian-American scientist and the brain behind the project, said Indo-US Brain Trust intends to assemble some of the finest minds and friends who, by their very actions and livelihoods, support a deepening of US-India collaboration in science, research, academia, entrepreneurship and innovation. "This group collectively represents the extraordinary partnership underway between the United States and India which is shaping a very bright future," he said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has disavowed racist comments by his former butler calling for President Obama to be hanged and shot for treason, even as the US Secret Service said it would investigate the matter. Anthony Senacal, 74, who served as Trump's personal aide for nearly two decades, has been unleashing a blizzard of racist and xenophobic comments on social media for several weeks now, but his latest posts ignited a firestorm on Thursday even as the Trump campaign moved swiftly to douse it, suggesting he is unhinged and is no longer in the billionaire's service. "Tony Senecal has not worked at Mar-a-Lago (a Trump home in Florida) for years, but nevertheless we totally and completely disavow the horrible statements made by him regarding the President," the Trump campaign said in a statement, adding that he is a "troubled" man. Troubled would be an understatement going by Senecal's rants that appear to have gotten progressively more rabid over time. "Just a short note to you on our pus headed `president' !!!! This character who I refer to as zero (0) should have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term !!!!!" he wrote in a post on Wednesday . "Instead he still remains in office doing everything he can to gut the America we all know and love!!!!!" In other posts, Senecal referred to Obama a "Kenyan fraud," and said the President should be "hung for treason." He also said Obama is a Muslim, and said Muslims are "invading our country," spouting the familiar fear-mongering among extreme rightwing elements in America. The former butler compounded it with even more provocative comments to a slavering media that called for "clarifications," saying Obama should be hung from the portico of the White House, which he called a "white mosque." Hatred for Muslims and blacks coursed out of his foul mouth to the extent he wanted some black majority cities in the US bombed. Senecal's unfiltered rants are part of a worsening discourse in an campaign that some pundits fear will be the most incendiary ever. All major players are said to be digging for dirt now and there is already enough muck and madness for the media to feast on, some involving the media itself. Friday's froth included exposes about how Trump often masqueraded as a spokesman named John Miller to promote himself to the media over the phone in the 1980s and 1990s. Disclosure of this con in the Washington Post on Friday resulted in an immediate backlash from Trump, who accused the paper's new owner, the online giant Amazon's Jeff Bezos, of using the publication to avoid taxes and protect the parent company's monopoly. Trump threatened to go after Bezos for anti-trust issues if he becomes president. Trump supporters continued their attacks on Hillary Clinton, digging up dirt on her investment banker son-in-law (Chelsea Clinton's husband) who allegedly lost clients millions of dollars after persuading them to invest in Greece. Another story related to the Clinton Foundation doling out money for an energy project to a "blonde bombshell" friend of the former President. And there are almost six more months to go for the election.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: A US journalist has kept his promise of literally 'eating his words' if Donald Trump clinches the Republican presidential nomination as the scribe consumed a nine-course meal featuring newsprint from his column. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank in October last year wrote a column predicting the demise of the 69-year-old billionaire's presidential ambitions. The headline of the column read, "Trump will lose, or I will eat this column." "Literally: The day Trump clinches the nomination I will eat the page on which this column is printed in Sunday's Post," Milbank wrote last year. "I have this confidence for the same reason (Mitt) Romney does: Americans are better than Trump," he had said. The Post writer, of course, was proven wrong earlier this month, when Trump became the Republican party's presumptive nominee after the Indiana primary. Milbank delivered on his headline's promise on Wednesday. The Washington Post carefully curated a nine-course meal to document the occasion including newspaper chilaquiles, dumplings, falafel, steaks, the way Trump likes them, and even a Trump Tower-inspired taco bowl. The dishes, prepared by the head chef at Washington's Del Campo restaurant, Victor Albisu, creatively incorporated newspaper pages into the recipes -- with some of the ink "mercifully well-ground" into the steak's chimichurri sauce, or sprinkled into the guacamole topping the taco bowl, or mixed into the chickpeas of the falafel, CBS News reported. To wash it all down, there were also some Trump wines. Milbank consumed it all on a live Facebook video stream. Later, Milbank said the experience "actually turned out not to be too bad at all." "It was not all that painful. And certainly not anywhere near as painful as it's going to be over the next six months," he told Facebook viewers. "I didn't think Trump was a flash in the pan. It was a showman who would - should not be taken seriously. I thought he definitely should be taken seriously. I thought the Republican voters ultimately would say we don't want this kind of guy representing us," Milbank was quoted as saying by National Public Radio. "And in the end, only 38 per cent did vote for Trump, but there never really was a mainstream viable alternative. So they wound up with Trump," he said. Trump, a New York-based real estate tycoon, joined politics about 10 months ago with political pundits giving him not much of a chance to make it this far.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: Democratic Party leaders are upping the pressure on Bernie Sanders to drop his presidential campaign, alarmed that his continued presence is undermining efforts to beat the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, and again win the White House. "I don't think they think of the downside of this," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a supporter of front-runner Hillary Clinton and broker of the post-primary peace between Clinton and then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. "It's actually harmful because she can't make that general-election pivot the way she should," Feinstein said. "Trump has made that pivot." The new concerns come after Sanders' recent wins over Clinton in Indiana and West Virginia. While those victories have provided his supporters a fresh sense of momentum heading into next week's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon, they did almost nothing to help Sanders cut into Clinton's nearly insurmountable lead in the delegates who will decide their party's nomination. Still Sanders soldiers on, frequently telling the thousands of supporters who attend his rallies that he still has a narrow path to the nomination. "Please do not moan to me about Hillary Clinton's problems," Sanders said in a recent interview with MSNBC. "It is a steep hill to climb, but we're going to fight for every last vote." Clinton, her aides and supporters have largely resisted calling on Sanders to drop out, noting that she fought her 2008 primary bid against Obama well into June. But now that Trump has locked up the Republican nomination, they fear the billionaire businessman is capitalizing on Sanders' decision to remain in the race by echoing his attacks and trying to appeal to the same independent, economically frustrated voters that back the Vermont senator. "I would just hope that he would understand that we need to begin consolidating our vote sooner rather than later," said Rep. Steve Israel, D-NY, a Clinton backer and former chief of efforts to elect Democrats to the House. "Democrats cannot wait too long." Though Clinton has for the past few weeks largely focused her rhetoric on Trump, campaign aides say the two-front effort hampers their ability to target both Sanders supporters and Republican-leaning independents that may be open to her candidacy. It also means she's spending time in primary states, rather than battlegrounds that will decide the general election. Clinton will return to Kentucky on Sunday, two days before the state's primary. She's sending high-level advocates to the state this weekend to rally voters, among them Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Reps. James Clyburn of South Carolina, G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas and Hakeem Jeffries and Joe Crowley of New York. While they can talk up Clinton, Sanders' determination to contest every state remaining has kept Obama and Vice President Joe Biden largely on the sidelines, benching two of her most powerful advocates. "It all sort of slows the takeoff of her general-election campaign," said Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a member of the party's liberal wing from a perennial battleground. Sanders' campaign saw its fundraising drop by about 40 percent last month and he's laid off hundreds of staffers. Biden said this week he "feels confident" that Clinton will be the nominee. Even Obama is pointing out the realities of the delegate math, which puts Clinton on track to capture the nomination early next month. Clinton has won 23 states to Sanders' 19, capturing 3 million more votes than her rival along the way. She has 94 percent of the delegates needed to win the nomination, which means she could lose all the remaining states and still emerge as the nominee as long as all her supporters among the party insiders known as superdelegates continue to back her. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a memo to donors this week that there is "no doubt" Clinton will be the Democratic nominee, describing her lead as "insurmountable." White House officials believe Obama has the ability to coax some die-hard Sanders' fans into the Clinton camp, particularly young people and liberals. But if he moves before Clinton officially captures the nomination, he risks angering those voters and undermining that effort. Clinton faces a similar calculus. While her international expertise could attract foreign policy-focused Republicans and suburban women, highlighting her record on those issues now might encourage Sanders to resurrect attacks on her vote in favor of the Iraq war. "When his rhetoric takes a sharper tone against her, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up," said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. "I know that can be used as ammunition." Clinton backers say there's plenty for Sanders to do in his old job  and a lot of good reasons for him to join forces. If Democrats regain the majority in the Senate, he'd likely become chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee. "We are looking forward to welcoming him back to the Senate," said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. Others note that Clinton has gone through this before and the party was able to unite after a tough primary in 2008. "She knows this is a long process. It's a marathon you run to the end," said Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. "On the Democratic side, we're attacking issues, not each other."</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The US is committed to maintaining its "important" and "vital" relationship with Pakistan, the Obama Administration said amid reports of strains in bilateral ties. "It is an important, vital relationship that we strongly believe in. Is it complicated at times? Absolutely it is. And do we see eye-to-eye on every issue with Pakistan? No, we don't," state department spokesman, John Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference. "But that's why the relationship matters so much because we have shared threats and shared concerns, shared interests in the region. And we're going to continue to work at it," he said. Kirby was responding to a question on the statement made by Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz that his country's relationship with the United States has been under stress for the past three months. Kirby said he has not seen the statement. "I didn't see his comments. So I'm going to refrain from responding specifically to that sentiment," he said. Kirby did not agree when asked if the US-Pakistan ties are not at the best of times these days. "It is an important relationship that we continue to work at very, very seriously. We're going to remain committed to. And I would not share that characterization of it," Kirby said.</text>

	<text>REDZIKOWO: The United States and Russia on Saturday accused each other of mounting an aggressive military presence in northern Europe, with Moscow vowing to "end threats" posed by a US missile shield near its border. The stepped-up war of words came as Poland on Saturday broke ground on the northern section of a US missile defence shield launched in Romania a day earlier, which Russia slammed as a serious security threat despite US assurances to the contrary. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday warned Washington that Moscow will consider measures to "end threats" from the US anti-missile systems in Europe but said it would not be engaged in a new arms race. "Now that these anti-missile elements have been installed, we will be forced to consider putting an end to the threats emerging in relation to Russia's security," Putin told defence officials in televised remarks. US President Barack Obama hit back hours later, warning Russia about its military build-up in northern Europe, as he hosted leaders from five Nordic countries at the White House. "We are united in our concern about Russia's growing aggressive military presence and posture in the Baltic-Nordic region," Obama said. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said last week that Moscow will set up three new divisions in the west and south of the country by the end of 2016 to counter Nato forces close to its border. Relations between Nato and Moscow have sharply deteriorated since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, sparking fears among other eastern European countries that they too could be targets of Russian aggression. Located in Redzikowo, northern Poland, and Deveselu in southern Romania, the two US missile interceptor stations are part of Nato's larger European shield, due to become fully operational by 2018. US and Nato officials insist the system is intended to counter the threat of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, particularly from so-called "rogue" states in the Middle East. But with the Redzikowo station just 250 kilometres from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, Moscow views the system as a security threat on its very doorstep. US Deputy Secretary of Defence Robert Work was on hand today for the start of construction on the Aegis Ashore-type missile defence facility in Redzikowo. It will include 24 land-based SM-3 missiles as well as anti-aircraft systems.</text>

	<text>The world's oldest living person, 116-year-old Susannah Mushatt Jones, died on Thursday in New York City, a research group said. Jones' death makes Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, a 116-year-old woman in Italy, the oldest living person, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Jones, who was born in the southern US state of Alabama in 1899, was the daughter of sharecroppers and granddaughter of slaves. After graduating from high school she moved north in 1922 to New Jersey and then New York, where she worked as a housekeeper and childcare provider, according to Guinness World Records and the Vandalia Senior Center in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, where she lived. Jones, who retired in 1965, had said that lots of sleep is the secret to her longevity and that she had never smoked or drank alcohol. The oldest verified person was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years and 164 days, the research group said.</text>

	<text>BHUBANESWAR: Farmers on Saturday distributed milk for free in the city and also poured it on the road in front of the state assembly as a mark of protest against the decision of Orissa State Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation Limited (OMFED) for curtailing the amount of its procurement by 30 per cent. The milk producers, under the banner of Odisha Dugdha Utpadak Sangram Samiti, staged dharna at the lower PMG near the assembly demanding an immediate solution to their problem. They also demanded the government to hike the minimum support price of milk from Rs 26.10 to Rs 30. Samiti president Janmejaya Jena said the Omfed has been deliberately denying the farmers since April 1 not to supply more milk to the plants. "Everything was fine before March 31, but what happened to Omfed suddenly to slash the procurement," he wondered. If Omfed has no capacity to market or process the milk, Jena said, the government should introduce milk in mid-day meal and Mamata scheme in the state to create its own market. "Milk, a healthy diet, will help in reduction of malnutrition from the state. Through this system, half of the milk procured by Omfed will directly go to school kids and pregnant women. The government can ensure nutrition to its children and also help the farmers in this way," he added. Resentment is brewing among the milk farmers across the state for Omfed's less procurement. The farmers of Jagatsinghpur and Puri had staged similar protests on April 4 and April 20. Later, farmers staged dharna at the lower PMG on May 6 on the issue. On Thursday, milk producers of Bargarh destroyed over 26,000 litre protesting the cooperative major's move.</text>

	<text>Hubballi: In the wake of severe drought, a number of blackbucks are said to have arrived on the outskirts of Hubballi, and have attracted wildlife photographers in large numbers to capture them in various moods and postures. Many blackbucks are straying into villages like Bandiwad, Shiraguppi, Kusugal, Gabburu, Noolvi, Adaragunchi and some nearby places on the city outskirts. They are wandering in the surrounding areas in search of water and fodder. Animal enthusiasts say they come to human habitats when they face scarcity of water, and are not getting sufficient fodder in forests and fields. They have appealed to the public to maintain harmony and respect the privacy of the bucks. But bucks straying into populated areas are being attacked by stray dogs. Some incidents have already taken place in the villages, but complaints have not been registered. Many wildlife photographers are now rushing to click rare pictures of blackbucks in the mornings and evenings, as it's a good opportunity to take their pictures from close range, as they wander in the fields. Dr Satish Hallikeri, a famous wildlife photographer of Hubballi, said blackbucks usually wander into human habitats in the evenings for safety. "The bucks are dependent on humans to protect themselves from wild animals in the forest, so they come into villages and towns," he added. "Earlier, we used to wait for many days the arrival of blackbucks, but now they are found in groups and we can take enough pictures. Wildlife photographers are getting good pictures of blackbucks and it's a good opportunity for us," said Dr Hallikeri, saying he has got good pictures of bucks in motion. He also appealed to the people of surrounding villages not to disturb the bucks, saying they are harmless and should not be harmed. Purushottam Rane, a wildlife photographer from Dharwad, said blackbucks are national property and should not be hunted or killed for money. 'Photographers should also maintain some distance while taking pictures and not disturb them," he added.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: There cannot be different standards to judge terrorism, India has conveyed to China which had blocked its attempt to designate Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Mohammed Masood Azhar as terrorist in a UN Security Council Committee, Lok Sabha was informed on Tuesday. In a written reply, Minister of State for Home Affairs Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary said China has placed a technical hold on India's application to designate Azhar as a terrorist in the UN Security Council Committee. He said the matter was taken up with China during the meeting of external affairs minister with Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi in Moscow on April 18, 2016 and during the visits of defence minister to China from April 17-20, and national security advisor to China from April 20-21. "It has clearly conveyed that there cannot be different standards to judge terrorism," said the minister. "India has forcefully taken with International community that while the Pakistan-based JeM was listed in UM (sic) Security Council Committee establish (sic) under UNSCR 1267/1989/2253 as far back as 2001 for its well known terror activities and links to the Al-Qaeda, the designation of the group's main leader, financer and motivator has been put on technical hold," he said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: China is deploying more troops on the border with India while modernizing its nuclear force and improving its strike capabilities, the Pentagon has said, even as the Obama administration challenged Beijing's assertion that New Delhi does not meet the criteria to be a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The state department, referring to Obama's statement in 2015, said India "meets missile technology control regime requirements and is ready for NSG membership". The shadow play between Washington, Beijing, and New Delhi was very much in evidence on Friday as the US defence establishment highlighted China's growing military strength in the region, ostensibly with an eye on courting India as a strategic counterweight. "We have noticed an increase in capability and force posture by the Chinese military in areas close to the border with India ," US deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia Abraham Denmark said during a news conference after Pentagon submitted its annual 2016 report to the US Congress on 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China'. "It's difficult to say how much of this is driven by internal considerations to maintain internal stability, and how much of it is an external consideration." But as far as Washington is concerned, he added, it would continue to enhance bilateral engagement with India "not in the China context but because India is an increasingly important player" by itself. "We are going to engage India because of its value," Denmark said. Beijing increasing military presence A series of reports and remarks from Washington amid continuing tensions with China is coming just ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit alongside India's own issues with Beijing, notably its use of Pakistan to needle India on issues such as terrorism and access to advanced nuclear technology. But in a report to the US Congress, the Pentagon warned of China's increasing military presence including bases in various parts of the world, in particular Pakistan  with which it has a "longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests". China's expanding international economic interests are increasing demands for the PLA Navy (PLAN) to operate in more distant seas to protect Chinese citizens, investments, and critical sea lines of communication, it said, adding, "China most likely will seek to establish additional naval logistics hubs in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and a precedent for hosting foreign militaries." READ ALSO: Indian, Chinese armies resolve to maintain peace in border meet The US navy itself is now working even more closely with the Indian Navy , outlining the emerging contours of efforts to dominate the sea lanes in the Indian Ocean through which some 60% of the world's energy trade passes. Meanwhile, Washington also endorsed India's claim for a membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group that the China-Pakistan axis has been thwarting . "I'd point you back to what the President said during his visit to India in 2015, where he reaffirmed that the US view was that India meets missile technology control regime requirements and is ready for NSG membership," State Department spokesman John Kirby said when asked about reports about Beijing and Islamabad joining hands to stall India's NSG membership. China has claimed that many members of the 48-nation NSG share its view that signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is an "important" standard for the group's expansion, an assertion that Washington does not agree with. The western world's support for India's membership is based in part on its sterling non-proliferation record, which Pakistan, as a rogue proliferator, and China as an illegal enabler, cannot match. All these issues are being thrashed out in private ahead of PM Modi's visit to Washington on June 7-8 in what promises to be one of the most consequential visits by an Indian leader to the US.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: The defence capabilities possessed by the US, Russia and India are among the main factors driving China to modernise its nuclear force and bolster its strategic strike capabilities, the Pentagon has said. In a report to Congress detailing China's nuclear power, Pentagon on Friday said the country was deploying new command, control and communications capabilities to its nuclear forces to improve control of multiple units in the field. China, it said, insists that the new generation of mobile missiles, with warheads consisting of multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) and penetration aids, are intended to ensure the viability of its strategic deterrent in the face of continued advances in the US and, to a lesser extent, Russian strategic ISR (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), precision strike, and missile defence capabilities. "Similarly, India's nuclear force is additional driver behind China's nuclear force modernisation," the Pentagon said in its report. Through the use of improved communication links, ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) units now have better access to battlefield information and uninterrupted communications connecting all command echelons, the report said. According to the Pentagon, China is working on a range of technologies to attempt to counter the US and other countries' ballistic missile defence systems, including manoeuvrable re-entry vehicles (MaRVs), MIRVs, decoys, chaff, jamming, and thermal shielding. China has acknowledged that it tested a hypersonic glide vehicle in 2014. The country's official media also cited numerous PLASAF (Peoples Liberation Army Second Artillery Force) training exercises featuring manoeuvre, camouflage, and launch operations under simulated combat conditions, which are intended to increase survivability, it said. Together with the increased mobility and survivability of the new generation of missiles, these technologies and training enhancements strengthen China's nuclear force and bolster its strategic strike capabilities. China's nuclear arsenal currently consists of approximately 75-100 ICBMs, including the silo-based CSS-4 Mod 2 (DF-5A) and Mod 3(DF-5B), the solid-fueled, road-mobile CSS-10 Mod 1 and Mod 2 (DF-31 and DF-31A), and the more-limited-range CSS-3 (DF-4). This force is complemented by road-mobile, solid-fueled CSS-5 Mod 6 (DF-21) MRBM for regional deterrence missions. Pentagon said China's nuclear weapons policy prioritises maintaining a nuclear force able to survive an attack and to respond with sufficient strength to inflict unacceptable damage on an enemy. "Further increases in the number of mobile ICBMs and the beginning of SSBN deterrence patrols will force the PLA to implement more sophisticated C2 systems and processes that safeguard the integrity of nuclear release authority for a larger, more dispersed force," it said. The Pentagon said China continues to produce the JIN-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), with four commissioned and another under construction. The JIN will eventually carry the CSS-NX-14 (JL-2) SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile) with an estimated range of 7,200 km. Together these will give the PLAN its first credible long-range sea-based nuclear capability. JIN SSBNs based at Hainan Island in the South China Sea would then be able to conduct nuclear deterrence patrols, it said.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Seeking to calm escalating tensions in the South China Sea , top generals from China and the US spoke by phone and said they were ready to work out an effective mechanism to prevent confrontation and maintain stability in the region. Chinese Chief of the General Staff Fang Fenghui told Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford in a video conference Thursday that China values freedom of navigation "more than any other country in the world" according to a statement posted on the Defense Ministry's website. While denying that Beijing was responsible for current tensions, Fang said China wanted to expand communication and cooperation with the US to prevent the issue impacting on the overall relationship. "The common ground and prospects for cooperation between China and the US far exceed our disagreements and contradictions," Fang was quoted as saying. China wants to take the big picture of China-US relations as the basis for approaching the South China Sea issue, Fang said. The conversation followed a sharp verbal exchange following a US destroyer's sail-by past China's largest man-made island in a move to exercise freedom of navigation. China said it deployed two navy fighter jets, one early warning aircraft and three ships to track and warn off the USS William P. Lawrence during as it sailed Wednesday within 22 kilometers of Fiery Cross Reef, the limit of what international law regards as an island's territorial sea. The reef which used to be submerged at high tide for all but two rocks is now an artificial island with a long airstrip, harbor and burgeoning above-ground infrastructure. It dwarfs all other features in the disputed area, was recently visited by China's military No. 2 and became prominent in the Chinese media when a famous singer of patriotic anthems entertained troops there.</text>

	<text>A video has surfaced on the cyberspace showing the British Queen criticizing Chinese officials as "very rude". The comments were made duringChinese president Xi Jinping's visit last year which was heralded by both governments as the "golden era" of bilateral relationship. "They were very rude to the ambassador," the Queen is heard saying in the video referring to the first woman British Ambassador to China, Barbara Woodward. Observers said the Queen's remarks would affect the relationship at a crucial time when Britain was considering whether to exit from European Union and might need enhanced investments from China. Relationship between the two countries have become intense in the past year with London describing it as a "Golden era" of ties. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry did not directly discuss the leaked video in reply to questions posed by journalists. But it suggested that the video may not affect the relationship. "President Xi's visit to the UK last year was a very successful one. Both sides have made great efforts for the success of the visit and both parties recognised that," Lu Kang, ministry spokesman said. The video shows the Queen being introduced to Metropolitan Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi. She is told that the commander had overseen security during president Xi's visit to the UK last October. D'Orsi: "I was the Gold Commander so I'm not sure whether you knew, but it was quite a testing time for..." Queen: "Oh, bad luck." D'Orsi: "It was at the point they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off, that I felt..." The Queen: "They were very rude to the ambassador." D'Orsi: "They were... it was very rude and undiplomatic I thought." The Queen: "Extraordinary". BBC quoted a Buckingham Palace spokesman saying, "We do not comment on the Queen's private conversations. "However, the Chinese State Visit was extremely successful and all parties worked closely to ensure it proceeded smoothly." Royal garden parties are filmed by the cameraman who covers the palace for UK broadcasters. British foreign secretary Philip Hammond said that "at times it got a bit stressful on both sides" but that state visits were big logistical challenges. Earlier, British prime minister David Cameron was overheard saying Afghanistan and Nigeria were "fantastically corrupt".</text>

	<text>LONDON: Queen Elizabeth II has been overheard on video calling Chinese officials "very rude" in a conversation with a senior police officer at a Buckingham Palace event. The comments, made Tuesday, were unusual because the 90-year-old monarch rarely comments publicly on political matters, and media accompanying her are asked not to eavesdrop on private conversations. The incident came hours after Prime Minister David Cameron was caught on microphone calling Nigeria and Afghanistan "fantastically corrupt." The queen's comments, recorded by the palace's official cameraman at a palace garden party and distributed to broadcasters, captured police Commander Lucy D'Orsi telling the queen that arranging the state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping in October had been a "testing time." Elizabeth responded: "They were very rude to the ambassador." In the video, an official introduced the queen to D'Orsi and explains that the officer was in charge of policing for the visit. The queen responded: "Oh! Bad luck." The official tells the queen that D'Orsi had been "seriously undermined by the Chinese" in the handling of the visit. When D'Orsi asked if the queen knew it had been a "testing time," the monarch interjected: "I did." The officer recalled a moment when Chinese officials walked out of a meeting with Barbara Woodward, British ambassador to China, in which the Chinese told the Brits the trip was off. "They walked out on both of us," D'Orsi said. "Extraordinary," the queen said. "It was very rude and undiplomatic I thought," D'Orsi said. Both the Metropolitan police and the palace refused to comment on what they described as private conversations. The palace stressed that Xi's visit had been "extremely successful." British officials laid on dollops of pomp and splendor  including a state banquet at the palace  during Xi's four-day state visit to nurture the U.K.'s developing economic relationship with China. The two countries signed more than 30 billion pounds ($46 billion) in trade agreements during the trip, and Cameron said Britain would be China's "partner of choice" in the West. Asked about the queen's reported remarks at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang declined to address them directly, but said Xi had made a "very successful visit" to Britain last year. "The working teams from both sides made huge efforts to make this possible. This effort has been highly recognized by both China and Britain," Lu said. Despite Lu's comments, China appeared to regard the reports as sensitive. Information about the queen's comments was difficult to find on China's heavily censored Internet and government monitors cut the signal of the British Broadcasting Company when it reported on the comments. British foreign secretary Philip Hammond said the visit "got a bit stressful on both sides" but had been "highly successful." He said that "our relationship with China is very strong and has been greatly strengthened by the success of that visit." This is not the first time British royals have been caught making undiplomatic remarks about the Chinese. Prince Charles branded Chinese diplomats "appalling old waxworks" in a private journal entry that had described the 1997 ceremony to hand Hong Kong back to Chinese rule. Charles, who is friends with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, did not attend a state banquet for Xi in October, but did hold private talks with the Chinese leader over tea. At another palace reception Tuesday, cameras recorded Cameron talking about an anti-corruption summit in London, which he will chair. "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain," Cameron told the monarch. "Nigeria and Afghanistan  possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world." Afghanistan's Ashraf Ghani and Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari are due to attend the London summit and each has contributed an essay on his efforts to tackle graft.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: The British media is riddled with "barbarians" who would benefit from a lesson in manners from China's ancient civilisation, a state-run newspaper said Thursday after Queen Elizabeth II called some Chinese officials "very rude". In a rare diplomatic gaffe, the British monarch was caught on camera at a Buckingham Palace garden party making unguarded comments about a state visit last year by President Xi Jinping that drummed up billions in Chinese investment. The remarks made headlines worldwide on Wednesday but initially they were largely censored in China, blacked out of BBC World transmissions, according to the British broadcaster. The Global Times newspaper, which is close to China's ruling Communist Party, blamed the British media for blowing the incident out of proportion and fawning over the footage as if it was "the most precious treasure". "The West in modern times has risen to the top and created a brilliant civilisation, but their media is full of reckless 'gossip fiends' who bare their fangs and brandish their claws and are very narcissistic, retaining the bad manners of 'barbarians'," it said in an editorial. "As they experience constant exposure to the 5,000 years of continuous Eastern civilisation, we believe they will make progress" when it comes to manners, it added in the Chinese-language piece, which was not published in English. London and Beijing have both proclaimed a new "golden era" of relations between the former imperial power -- whose forces repeatedly invaded China in the 19th century -- and the rising Asian giant, now the world's second-largest economy. Xi's trip in October saw a clutch of contracts announced, which Cameron said were worth almost $58 billion. At the time the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official mouthpiece, breathlessly portraying the visit as the start of a beautiful friendship. But in her recorded comments the Queen commiserated with a police commander for her "bad luck" in having to oversee security for Xi and his wife. Members of the Chinese delegation "were very rude to the ambassador", the monarch said, exclaiming: "Extraordinary!" A columnist at Chinese website "Today's Headlines" recalled visible mutual discomfort during the three-day sojourn, describing it as "thought-provoking awkwardness" and adding it "primarily arose out of cultural and political differences". On Chinese social media posters decried Britain's lack of awareness and understanding of Chinese ways, noting "an arrogance which makes them feel they needn't bother to learn". "Every country's customs are different, OK - not all people must cater to you," wrote a commenter on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Others were ashamed. "We're already embarrassed by talk about what our average people get up to abroad," said one. "Being embarrassed by our officials abroad is even worse." The British monarch never expresses overtly political views in public and is known for her discretion, never granting an interview in her 64-year reign. But her comments came as British Prime Minister David Cameron was recorded calling Nigeria and Afghanistan "possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world", heaping scrutiny on the tete-a-tetes of British leadership. "Even among Western countries, Britain is most frequently 'caught with its pants down' and 'exposing itself'," the Global Times editorial said. But it added that it would be "unthinkable" for British authorities to have deliberately leaked the royal footage, as "if they had deliberately done so, that would have been truly crude and rude". The paper shrugged off the Queen's comments themselves as "not a big deal", stating: "Chinese diplomats surely also scoff at British bureaucrats in private."</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Defending its move to block India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, China has claimed that several members of the 48-nation bloc shared its view that signing of the NPT was an "important" standard for the NSG's expansion. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that not only China but also a lot of other NSG members are of the view that Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the cornerstone for safeguarding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Asked about reports that China is pushing Pakistan's entry into NSG linking it to India's admission into the bloc, Lu said the NSG is an important part of NPT, which has been the consensus of the international community for long. Although India is not part of the NSG , Indian side recognises this consensus, he claimed. "All the multilateral non-proliferation export control regime including the NSG has regarded NPT as an important standard for the expansion of the NSG," he said. Avoiding any references to Pakistan , Lu said "apart from India, lot of other countries expressed their willingness to join. Then it raised the question to the international community - shall the non-NPT members also become part of the NSG?" he said. "The international community believes that there should be a side discussion in the NSG on this issue and decision should be made in accordance with relevant rules. China's position is not directed against any specific country but applies to all the non-NPT members," he said. India, Pakistan, Israel and South Sudan were among four UN member states which have not signed the NPT, the international pact aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Last month Pakistan prime minister's advisor on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz said that China has helped Pakistan to stall India's bid to get NSG membership.</text>

	<text>BEIJING/HONG KONG: A US navy warship sailed close to a disputed reef in the South China Sea on Tuesday, a US Department of Defense official said, prompting anger in Beijing which denounced the patrol as illegal and a threat to peace and stability. Guided missile destroyer the USS William P. Lawrence travelled within 12 nautical miles of Chinese-occupied Fiery Cross Reef, Defense Department spokesman Bill Urban said. The so-called freedom of navigation operation was undertaken to "challenge excessive maritime claims" by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam which were seeking to restrict navigation rights in the South China Sea, he said. "These excessive maritime claims are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention in that they purport to restrict the navigation rights that the United States and all states are entitled to exercise," Urban said in an emailed statement. Beijing and Washington have traded accusations that the other is militarising the South China Sea as China undertakes large-scale land reclamations and construction on disputed featues while the United States has increased its patrols and exercises in the region. Facilities on Fiery Cross Reef include a 3,000-metre (10,000-foot) runway and Washington is concerned China will use it to press its extensive territorial claims at the expense of weaker rivals. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the U.S. ship illegally entered Chinese waters and was tracked and warned. "This action by the US side threatened China's sovereignty and security interests, endangered the staff and facilities on the reef, and damaged regional peace and stability," he told a daily news briefing. SENSITIVE AREA China claims most of the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims. The Pentagon last month called on China to reaffirm it has no plans to deploy military aircraft in the disputed Spratly Islands after Beijing used a military plane to evacuate sick workers from Fiery Cross. "Fiery Cross is sensitive because it is presumed to be the future hub of Chinese military operations in the South China Sea, given its already extensive infrastructure, including its large and deep port and 3000-metre runway," said Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. "The timing is interesting, too. It is a show of US determination ahead of President Obama's trip to Vietnam later this month," Storey added. Speaking in Hanoi ahead of Obama's visit, Daniel Russel, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, said freedom of navigation operations were important for smaller nations. "If the world's most powerful navy cannot sail where international law permits, then what happens to the ships of navy of smaller countries?," Russel told reporters before news of the operation was made public. "If our warships can't exercise its legitimate rights under international law at sea, then what about the fishermen, what about the cargo ships? How will they prevent themselves from being blocked by stronger nations?" China has reacted with anger to previous US freedom of navigation operations, including the overflight of fighter planes near the disputed Scarborough Shoal last month, and when long-range US bombers flew near Chinese facilities under construction on Cuarteron Reef in the Spratlys last November. US naval officials believe China has plans to start reclamation and construction activities on Scarborough Shoal, which sits further north of the Spratlys within the Philippines claimed 200 nautical mile (370 km) exclusive economic zone. The move also comes as tough-talking city mayor Rodrigo Duterte looks set to take the Philippines' presidency. He has proposed multilateral talks on the South China Sea. Criticism of China over the South China Sea will rebound like a coiled spring, a Chinese diplomat said on Friday, as a US warship visited Shanghai against a backdrop of rising tension in the region.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: In a surprise move, China has elevated the rank of Tibet's Military Command which looks after the security along its border with India by putting it under the jurisdiction of PLA ground forces, suggesting it may "undertake some kind of military combat mission in future." "China raises Tibet Military Command's (TMC) power rank," state-run Global Times said in a frontpage report. "The TMC's political rank will be elevated to one level higher than its counterpart provincial-level military commands and will come under the leadership of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)," it reported citing another official newspaper the 'China Youth Daily.' "The promotion marks a new journey for the TMC command's construction," it said. The sudden "elevation" surprised many observers as the PLA in this year's reform brought most of the provincial military commands under the control of Central Military Commission's (CMC) new National Defence Mobilisation Department. CMC, the overall high command of the PLA, is directly headed by President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. "The TMC on the other hand, is under the leadership of the Chinese ground forces, which suggests that the command may undertake some kind of military combat mission in the future," the report quoted a "source close to the matter" as saying. There was no elaboration of what the "military combat mission" will be. Seasoned military observers termed the report confusing. Until last year, China had seven military area commands in Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou and Guangzhou. Of this Chengdu looked after security of India's eastern sector in the Tibet region including Arunachal Pradesh while Lanzhou in Xinjiang looked after partly the western sector, including Kashmir region and Pakistan. As per the new strategic zone plan, both Chengdu and Lanzhou gets integrated into strategic command region making it perhaps the biggest areas for Chinese military. TMC may perhaps get a four-star General instead of a Lt General, while Lanzhou where the combat forces are stationed is already led by a General. "Loosely put it, the report is very confusing. we need to more information to get a proper prospective," a senior military official told PTI. India-China borders largely enjoy peace and tranquillity, notwithstanding the dispute over the 3,488-km long border. They have set up mechanism at the ground and at the level of the government to address issues relating to the recurring transgressions by PLA troops in the areas claimed by India. The issue was broadly discussed during last month's visit of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar to China during which the two sides agreed to set up 'Hot Lines' between the militaries.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: A Chinese court is compensating a man with $400,000 for spending more than 20 years in prison for murder, on false charges. Chen Man, now in his early 50s, was given a suspended death sentence which in China is normally commuted to life imprisonment in November 1994 for killing in the southern island province of Hainan. After appeals in various courts of the country, going upto the highest court, he was finally acquitted and released in February due to "lack of evidence". The case is one of the stellar example of miscarriages of justice in China, where courts are tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party quite often resulting in forced confessions in which more than 99 percent of criminal defendants are found guilty. Hainan's provincial court, which upheld Chen's suspended death sentence in 1999, agreed Friday to pay him around 2.75 million yuan ($422,000) for loss of personal freedom and mental suffering, said state broadcaster China Central Television. Chen initially demanded more than 9.66 million yuan in compensation and for the court to make formal apologies in national and local media outlets. "I have to accept it," Chen told the Legal Evening News on Friday. "We have regrets. But we acknowledge it according to the State Compensation Law," he said, according to the report. China quite often clears the name of wrongfully executed or jailed convicts when others come forward to confess their crimes, or the supposed murder victim is found to be alive. Of those exonerated in recent years, Chen spent the longest in prison, the state media said. For others, the new verdicts arrive too late. A man named Hugjiltu was cleared of rape and murder in 2014, nearly two decades after he was convicted and executed at the age of 18 in the northern region of Inner Mongolia.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: The world's second-biggest economy trounced the United States in another aspect as Chinese companies inked the highest number of overseas deals so far this year. The number of deals, mostly purchase of foreign companies, since January amounted to $110.8 billion. In fact, Chinese firms surpassed their own full-year record in 2015 when they spent $106.8 billion on foreign acquisitions, according to UK-based data provider, Dealogic. They were engaged in 17 deals, each worth more than $1 billion, while the rest were of lesser value. Taking the cake was a $43 billion cash offer by China National Chemical Corp for purchase of Swiss pesticide and seed company Syngenta. The US has dominated the rankings in overseas acquisitions since 2007. Dealogic predicted that China will come ahead of the US at the end of 2016. The acquisition spree, which covers the United States, is partly driven by economic slowdown in China. the ongoing economic slowdown in China may be forcing Chinese companies to explore new avenues in overseas markets to sustain their growth, Abdul Erumban, senior economist with the Conference Board, told TOI. Chinese companies, many of whom are flush with funds, are finding it difficult to identify suitable investment destinations in their home country. Significantly, the anti-China tirade by US politicians has done little to hamper Chinese investments in that country. Financial compilers said that Chinese companies acquired 25 firms based in the United States and Canada last year, compared to just four in 2014 and nine in 2013. Analysts also said that Chinese investments overseas would more than double of the 2015 record because Chinese companies are targeting more than 1,000 foreign firms for acquisition in 2016. Last year, Chinese business groups took control of 598 companies, according to the financial compiler. Drawing the most attention is the wrangling involving Chinese conglomerate Anbang Insurance Group and Marriott International, which are battling to acquire the iconic Starwood Hotels and Resorts for nearly $14 billion. Anbang upped its offer on Monday, leaving the market waiting anxiously for Marriott's next move. Some analysts believe the Chinese government is directly orchestrating the buying spree by Chinese business groups. The Chinese government is also encouraging overseas investment in strategic sectors. This is evident in the fact that state-owned Chinese banks are extending loans in billions of dollars to the acquiring companies. One of the goals behind the drive is moving China's excess manufacturing capacity to Africa, Latin America, Europe and elsewhere where the capacity is needed. "The Chinese leadership has a knack of making foreign investments by Chinese companies look as if they are of mutual benefit; promises of Chinese investment and flows of capital have long been vehicles of Chinese foreign policy," the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin said in a recent study.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: China has reclaimed more than 3,200 acres of land in the southeastern South China Sea. But the country's focus has shifted to developing and weaponizing those man-made islands so it will have greater control over the maritime region without resorting to armed conflict, according to a new Pentagon report. In its most detailed assessment to date of China's island-building program, the defense department said three of the land features in the Spratly Islands now have nearly 10,000-foot runways and large ports in various stages of construction. And it has excavated deep channels, created and dredged harbors, and constructed communications, logistics and intelligence gathering facilities. The report argues that the accelerated building effort doesn't give China any new territorial rights. But it says the airfields, ship facilities, surveillance and weapons equipment will allow China to significantly enhance its long-term presence in the South China Sea. "This would improve China's ability to detect and challenge activities by rival claimants or third parties, widen the range of capabilities available to China, and reduce the time required to deploy them," according to the report released Friday. "China is using coercive tactics short of armed conflict, such as the use of law enforcement vessels to enforce maritime claims, to advance their interests in ways that are calculated to fall below the threshold of provoking conflict," the report adds. The 3,200 acres only represents China's reclamation in the Spratleys and doesn't include its building in the Paracels, further northwest, including the contested Woody Island, in its estimates. China has deployed anti-aircraft missiles to Woody Island. The Pentagon declined to release details on the amount of increased reclamation in the Paracels or to provide a more concrete estimate of the increase in building in the Spratly Islands. Chinese officials have defended the land reclamation by saying it is Beijing's territory, adding that the buildings and infrastructure are for public service use and to support fishermen. It accuses the Philippines, Vietnam and others of carrying out their own building work on other islands. The report also notes that China has continued to assert sovereignty over the East China Sea, including the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan. Vietnam, China and Taiwan all claim the Paracels, and the three along with the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei claim all or parts of the Spratlys. The US says it takes no side in the territorial disputes, but supports freedom of passage through the area, which is one of the world's busiest sea lanes. China's island building, the report concludes, is designed to walk right up to  but not cross  "the threshold of provoking the United States, its allies and partners, or others in the Asia-Pacific region into open conflict." More broadly, the report says that China is steadily increasing its role and power around the world, while continuing to modernize and build up its military and inventory of ships, missiles and aircraft. Specifically, it notes China's plans to build its first overseas military facility in Djibouti to help support naval operations in the region. The report also repeats assertions by defense secretary Ash Carter that continued provocation by China may only improve US relations in the Asia Pacific. "China's increasingly assertive efforts to advance its national sovereignty and territorial claims, its forceful rhetoric, and lack of transparency about its growing military capabilities and strategic decision-making continue to raise tensions and have caused countries in the region to enhance their ties to the United States," the report said. US officials have been increasingly concerned China's activities could be a prelude to enforcing a possible air defense identification zone over the South China Sea, similar to one it declared over disputed Japanese-held islands in the East China Sea in 2013. As noted in previous year's reports, China continues to target US government and Defense Department computer systems through cyber intrusions. The report said that during 2015, China used it's cyber capabilities to spy on the US and steal information from computer networks. "The information targeted could potentially be used to benefit China's defense industry, high-technology industries, and provide the CCP insights into US leadership perspectives on key China issues," the report said.</text>

	<text>WASHINGTON: China and Pakistan are closely coordinating moves to block India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). Beijing is using Pakistan's non-starter position with the NSG to block India's application in the name of parity, stating that it would either support NSG entry for both India and Pakistan, or none of them. Talking about the China - Pakistan grand strategy to stall India's admission into the NSG , well placed US sources who work with the NSG said that from all counts it does appear that China and Pakistan are coordinating closely to stop the Indian entry. The sources pointed to the fact that when India sought an information session with the NSG Participating Governments (PGs) at the recent NSG Consultative Group meeting on April 25 and 26, where it would have made a formal presentation to the NSG Group in support of its membership, Pakistan requested for a similar discussion slot with the NSG PGs. Sources said that even though Pakistan was fully aware that its request would be rejected, it made its application at the cue of China, in order for Beijing to look even-handed when it sought the rejection of both requests on grounds of parity. Providing an insight into the China-Pakistan plan to stall India, sources say that Pakistan is now going to write to all the NSG PGs about its wish to join the group. This is being done in anticipation of an application by India for NSG membership at the forthcoming plenary session of the group in June. The Pakistani application, added sources, is "just a decoy" for China to reject both applications on grounds of parity. China knows that Pakistan does not stand a chance at the NSG, and most of the states will reject Islamabad's application. By taking the lead in rejecting the Pakistani application along with that of India, China would like to project its position as "neutral" when in reality it is "working in tandem with Pakistan to stall India's application ". US sources are disappointed with the Chinese tactics of "using Pakistan's non credentials with the NSG to settle scores with India". Informed sources say that this strategy is not a secret and during Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain's visit to China in November 2015, China revealed its hand when it told President Hussain that if India is allowed to get NSG membership, China would ensure that Pakistan also joins the group. The Chinese government told President Hussain that "if India is allowed to join the NSG and Pakistan is deprived of NSG membership, Beijing will veto the move and block the Indian entry". Sources maintain that true to its word, China is following a plan that will enable it to use Pakistan's non-acceptance at the NSG to block India's acceptance. "It is both or none" is the Chinese plan to derail the Indian application, say sources. Chinese officials at the NSG level have been using the Pakistan card to stop India's entry into it while appearing to be even handed in China's relations with India. Well informed sources also point to comments made by Pakistan's former permanent representative to the United Nations Zamir Akram who virtually admitted the grand China - Pakistan plan to stall India's entry into the NSG when, he said, that India will not make it to the NSG despite US support since China was committed to both India and Pakistan joining the NSG at the same time, and would block any move for a unilateral admission of India. He added that chances of India gaining entry into the NSG are virtually nil. The former senior Pakistani official also made it known that Islamabad has "friends at the NSG" who won't let India enter the group. US sources have seen through China's game of "either both or none" in the NSG. They say that India's non-proliferation credentials can never be compared with Pakistan's, as Pakistan has a history of "selling Nuclear technology to rogue states like Libya". They point to the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, Dr A.Q. Khan, and his global nuclear trade. Added to this history, is the fear in the West that Pakistan's nuclear weapons, especially the tactical version that it is now in the process of developing, can easily find their way into the hands of terrorists, as Pakistan's nuclear command is extremely vulnerable to penetration by Islamic hardliners. Well-placed sources say that China is aware of this situation, and is mindful of the fact that Pakistan can never be considered for membership in any global nuclear club, but that won't stop China from using Pakistan as a "parity token to stop India which is fast emerging as China's competitor at a global level". By rejecting the applications of both Pakistan and India, China is telling New Delhi and the NSG governments that it is "neutral", when in fact it is working with Pakistan to reject India's application in the hope that there won't be an Indian reaction. US sources say China's grand plan is to "eat its cake and have it too", that is reject the Indian application to the NSG on the pretext of "neutrality" between India and Pakistan and then hope that the "neutrality" card will stop any Indian commercial blowback on China. Giving further insight into the plan, US sources say that China "would be naive to expect that there won't be an Indian reaction, and especially a commercial one, as China is mindful that India is fully qualified to join the NSG, and by playing the 'Pakistan parity card', China is only hurting its own interests with an upcoming economic power, India."</text>

	<text>BEIJING/HONG KONG: China scrambled fighter jets on Tuesday as a US navy ship sailed close to a disputed reef in the South China Sea, a patrol China denounced as an illegal threat to peace which only went to show its defence installations in the area were necessary. Guided missile destroyer the USS William P Lawrence travelled within 12 nautical miles of Chinese-occupied Fiery Cross Reef, US defence department spokesman, Bill Urban said. The so-called freedom of navigation operation was undertaken to "challenge excessive maritime claims" by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam which were seeking to restrict navigation rights in the South China Sea, Urban said. "These excessive maritime claims are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention in that they purport to restrict the navigation rights that the United States and all states are entitled to exercise," Urban said in an emailed statement. China and the United States have traded accusations of militarising the South China Sea as China undertakes large-scale land reclamations and construction on disputed features while the United States has increased its patrols and exercises. Facilities on Fiery Cross Reef include a 3,000-metre (10,000-foot) runway which the United States worries China will use it to press its extensive territorial claims at the expense of weaker rivals. China's defence ministry said two fighter jets were scrambled and three warships shadowed the US ship, telling it to leave. The US patrol "again proves that China's construction of defensive facilities on the relevant reefs in the Nansha Islands is completely reasonable and totally necessary", it said, using China's name for the Spratly Islands where much of its reclamation work is taking place. Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the US ship illegally entered Chinese waters. "This action by the US side threatened China's sovereignty and security interests, endangered the staff and facilities on the reef, and damaged regional peace and stability," he told a daily news briefing. Sensitive area China claims most of the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have overlapping claims. The Pentagon last month called on China to reaffirm it has no plans to deploy military aircraft in the Spratly Islands after China used a military plane to evacuate sick workers from Fiery Cross. "Fiery Cross is sensitive because it is presumed to be the future hub of Chinese military operations in the South China Sea, given its already extensive infrastructure, including its large and deep port and 3000-metre runway," said Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. "The timing is interesting, too. It is a show of US determination ahead of President Obama's trip to Vietnam later this month." Speaking in Vietnam, Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, said freedom of navigation operations were important for smaller nations. "If the world's most powerful navy cannot sail where international law permits, then what happens to the ships of navy of smaller countries?," Russel told reporters before news of the operation was made public. China has reacted with anger to previous US freedom of navigation operations, including the overflight of fighter planes near the disputed Scarborough Shoal last month, and when long-range US bombers flew near Chinese facilities under construction on Cuarteron Reef in the Spratlys last November. US naval officials believe China has plans to start reclamation and construction activities on Scarborough Shoal, which sits further north of the Spratlys within the Philippines claimed 200 nautical mile (370 km) exclusive economic zone. A tough-talking city mayor, Rodrigo Duterte, looks set to become president of the Philippines after an election on Monday. He has proposed multilateral talks on the South China Sea. A Chinese diplomat warned last week that criticism of China over the South China Sea would rebound like a coiled spring.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: A Chinese court has jailed two activists for taking part in small-scale pro-democracy protests after detaining them for nearly three years, their lawyer said Tuesday. Yuan Bing and Yuan Xiaohua were jailed for four years and three-and-a-half years respectively, on charges including "picking quarrels and making trouble", their attorney Lu Jingmei told AFP. A court in the central Chinese province of Hubei convicted them over a series of protests around the country in which they held signs in public places calling for freedom and democracy, Lu added. Their tour, dubbed "Enlightening China", saw them demonstrate, make speeches and meet activists in nine cities, according to China Human Rights Defenders, an overseas-based advocacy group. The two men, who are not related, were held in detention for 34 months before being put on trial, Lu said. China's President Xi Jinping has overseen a crackdown on dissent since coming to power in 2012, with hundreds of lawyers, activists and academics detained and dozens jailed. The charge of "picking quarrels" has increasingly been used by courts to jail activists over small-scale street protests. Beijing often says human rights have improved in China in recent decades, citing economic growth as an example.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: A Chinese transgender man said he was disappointed but will continue to fight for equality after a labour arbitration panel on Tuesday rejected his complaint that he was fired unfairly, in China's first transgender job discrimination case. The man, who uses the name Mr C to protect his parents' privacy, said the panel in the southwestern province of Guizhou granted his demand for about $62 in back wages but also ruled that his employer broke no law in dismissing him. "I am not satisfied with just the paid-back wages. What I want is respect, and respect from the whole of society for minorities like us," Mr C said in a phone interview shortly after the arbitration panel handed down its decision. "I am very disappointed about the result," he added. "This (arbitration) process has made me realize that discrimination against sexual orientation is far worse than I had expected, and I will continue to appeal to defend my rights." Mr C was hired in 2015 for a sales job with a local health services center but was let go eight days later, when the probation period ended. Mr C believed he was dismissed because he lives as a man even though he was born a woman. The arbitration panel rejected a voice recording in which the company's sales manager told Mr C that the way he dressed would negatively affect the firm, said Huang Sha, a lawyer for Mr C The panel ruled that the conversation "did not represent the company's true intent," citing the fact that the sales manager did not work in the personnel department. Instead, the panel accepted a performance evaluation produced by Ciming Health Exam Center that stated Mr C did not demonstrate adequate skills for the sales job, Huang said. "We think the evaluation is an excuse," the lawyer said, adding that the sales manager had previously acknowledged Mr C's abilities. Both Huang and Mr C said they plan to appeal the labour panel's decision at a local court. A woman who works for Ciming denied Tuesday that the company discriminated against Mr C She refused to provide her name or further details. China does not recognize many LGBT rights such as gay marriage and its laws do not protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: Taiwan's new government will be to blame for any crisis with China that erupts once it assumes office, Beijing said on Wednesday, heaping on the pressure ahead of the inauguration of a new president from a pro-independence party. China and self-ruled Taiwan underwent a rapprochement under the outgoing government which was run by China-friendly Nationalists, but ties have begun to strain with their successors, the independence-leaning Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Tsai and the DPP won presidential and parliamentary elections by a landslide in January, in part on rising anti-China sentiment. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to take the island which it considers a breakaway province, particularly if it makes moves toward independence. Tsai, who assumes office on May 20, has said she will maintain the status quo, but has never conceded to a key bilateral agreement referencing the "one China" principle, which has angered Beijing. Under the "1992 consensus" with the Nationalists, Taiwan and China agreed there is only one China, with each having their own interpretation of what that means. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan at the end of the civil war with the Communists in 1949. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said it was clear who was "destroying bridges" and trying to change the status quo. "If there are those who are unclear on this point, or are offering encouragement from the wings, this is really not a sensible act," Ma told a briefing live on state television. "We must repeat, if there is deadlock across the Taiwan Strait, or if there is a crisis, the responsibility will be on the heads of those who change the status quo." China has been pressuring Taiwan since the January election, forcibly repatriating Taiwanese fraud suspects from Kenya and Malaysia and establishing diplomatic ties with a former Taiwanese ally in Africa, Gambia. On Sunday, the incoming Taiwanese government accused China of "political interference" after Beijing cast doubt over the island keeping its observer status at the World Health Organisation. Ma said Taiwan's previous participation had been predicated on acceptance of the "one China" principle, something recognised by the United Nations, of which the WHO is a part. "With a challenge to the one China principle which has the recognition of the international community, the relevant arrangements will be hard to continue," he said. Taiwan has attended the annual gathering of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO, since 2009 as an observer.</text>

	<text>BEIJING: As many as 53 people were killed and 16 others listed missing in natural disasters across China last month which affected more than 5.6 million people and caused direct economic losses of about $550 million. The disasters included drought, earthquakes, floods, forest fires, gales and hail, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday, citing a Ministry of Civil Affairs statement released on Friday. They caused about 3.6 billion yuan (about $550 million) in direct economic losses, it said. More than 53,000 people had to be relocated, 28,000 of whom needed emergency assistance, while about 6,000 houses collapsed, mostly in southern regions hit by floods, the report said. Overall damage was generally less than in the same period last year, during which 68 people were killed.</text>

	<text>New Delhi: The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday that air quality had improved in the first week of the odd-even phase 2 but then deteriorated possibly due to meteorological factors, crop fires in the neighbouring states and landfill fires in the city. DPCC submitted its findings in a detailed report based on the data from four automatic stations and 74 other locations as well as industrial areas in the capital. The bench asked Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and all other parties to file their reports on the odd-even scheme between April 15 and 30 by Friday. The tribunal asked the Delhi government if the drive was worth investing in. "Wouldn't it be better if the money spent on the scheme was utilised for something else?" Earlier, too, NGT told the government to explain why it was not emphasising on pollution sources like dust and burning waste the way it had been focusing on the odd-even scheme. DPCC divided their monitoring of four automatic stations at RK Puram, Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar into four phasesApril 6 to 14, April 15 to 21, April 22 to 30 and May 1to 6, covering the days before and after the road rationing scheme. The average PM2.5 concentration before odd-even ranged from 31 to 276 micrograms per cubic metres (g/ m3) while the wind speed varied between 0.95 and 3.23 metres per second (m/s). Between April 15 and 21, the range was 43 to 205 g/m3 and the wind speed 0.78-3.08m/s. But in the second week, PM2.5 ranged from 53 to 328 g/m3 while the wind speed had reduced to 0.721.68m/s. However, just after the odd-even 2, the PM2.5 level fell between 29 and 262 g/m3. If one considers the averages for the week, it was 89g/m3 before the odd-even 2, but spiked to 111in the first week and further to 154 in the second week. The DPCC data for PM10 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reflect similar trends. "The analysis of the data shows the total period was highly influenced by metrological parameters like wind speed, wind direction, ambi ent temperature and others," the DPCC report said. It is observed that "local and trans-state movement of pollutants also influenced the air quality of Delhi during odd-even. The probable factors are crop residue burning in Haryana and Punjab, local fires and landfill fires in Delhi". DPCC's monitoring of 74 locations in central Delhi and border areas, and on Inner Ring Road and Outer Ring Road showed a marginal decrease in PM2.5 levels in central Delhi and on Inner Ring Road compared to the other two areas in the first week but April 22 onwards, a jump was seen at all locations that dropped only in the first week of May.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Environmentalists on Friday sounded caution over the latest WHO report, which showed that Delhi was not the most polluted city as per 2013-14 data, saying it does not give the right picture. Greenpeace India campaigner Sunil Dahiya said the 2014 WHO report, under which Delhi earned the tag of being the most polluted city, was based on data of 2013 from six monitoring stations while the new report records data from 10 stations. "If anybody is saying that there is improvement in Delhi's air quality, then it will be wrong as you are taking the data for the same year but at more places," Dahiya said. Referring to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's statement "congratulating" people over the findings of the report, Sunita Narain of Centre for Science and Environment said people rush to take credits "where it's not due." "This data is comparing 2012 to 2014. This is not of the current chief minister's period," she said, noting that the data was two-year old. Dahiya also said there could have been no major improvement as there were no major steps taken by Centre or Delhi government during the 2013-14 period based on which WHO compiled its data. He said claiming that air pollution situation in Delhi has improved would be wrong as the base years for both the WHO reports, 2016 and 2014, were almost similar "so the question of improvement does not arise as it was the same air quality at the same place with more stations." Emphasizing that the current situation may be "different", CSE's Anumita Roychowdhury said,"....The pollution is not getting worse but the levels are still very high. Yes, the current situation can be different." According to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report 2016 based on data collected between 2008 and 2013, and in case of Delhi based on 2013-14, the national capital was the 11th most-polluted city while four other Indian cities - Gwalior (2), Allahabad (3), Patna (6) and Raipur (7) - figured in the top seven cities with worst air pollution</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday gave its approval to move official amendments in the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management And Planning Authority (CAMPA) Bill, 2015. The CAMPA Bill is meant to promote afforestation and regeneration activities to compensate for forest land diverted to non-forest uses, by regulating and managing $5.3 billion (almost Rs.350 billion) collected over years. The government in a statement said this legislation will ensure efficient and transparent utilisation of "unspent amount" of Rs.40,000 crore under the ad hoc CAMPA. This unspent amount, submitted at banks, generates approximately Rs.6,000 crore per annum as "compensatory levies" and "interest". "Utilisation of these amounts will facilitate timely execution of appropriate measures to mitigate impact of diversion of forest land, for which these amounts have been realised," the government said in a statement. "Apart from mitigating the impact of diversion of forest land, utilisation of these amounts will result in creation of productive assets and generation of huge employment opportunities in the rural areas, especially the backward tribal areas." The Narendra Modi government in April 2015 approved the bill for introduction in parliament. However, it was rejected in theRajya Sabha, where the government is in minority. The cabinet decision to amend the CAMPA Bill provisions came just two days before India is to officially sign the COP-21 Global Climate Agreement at New York City on April 22. The bill was also included in a report issued by Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, listing it as India's action after the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Tuesday unanimously passed the much awaited Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Bill, 2015 that aims to ensure expeditious utilization of accumulated unspent amounts to the tune of around Rs 40,000 crore for increasing forest cover in India. The amount has been lying idle with an ad-hoc central body for over 10 years. The Bill is likely to be passed by the Rajya Sabha next week. The proposed legislation will also ensure expeditious and efficient utilization of Rs 6000 crore per annum, accrued as compensatory levies and interest. The utilisation of these amounts (mostly by states) will facilitate timely execution of measures to mitigate impact of diversion of forest land in the country. It will also result in creation of productive assets and generation of huge employment opportunities in the rural and tribal areas. "India in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (submitted to the UN body on climate change as part of the Paris Agreement) has committed to create 2.5 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink. The (passing of the) Bill will be a great enabler", said Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar after passing of the Bill in Lok Sabha. Calling it a "historical legislation", Javadekar said the passing of the Bill would give a major boost to the country's efforts to increase its forest cover. Any user agency which diverts forest land for non-forest purpose is, at present, required to deposit prescribed amount to an ad-hoc central government body. This amount is supposed to be utilized to mitigate impact of diversion of the forest land. However, the amount to the tune of Rs 40,000 crore (as on date)  accumulated over the past 10 years with the ad hoc body, Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)  remains unspent. The purpose of the proposed legislation is, therefore, to provide safety, security and transparency in utilization of these amounts, which are currently kept in different nationalised banks at the behest of the ad-hoc body. The proposed legislation is aimed at setting up the National Compensatory Afforestation Fund at centre and the State Compensatory Afforestation Fund in respective states. Majority of the collected fund will be spent by the states for afforestation and other related works including forest regeneration and wildlife protection. The Bill also provides for setting up a national authority at centre and state-level authority in respective states to monitor the utilisation of the funds. The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in May last year. After introducing the Bill in Lok Sabha, the government had referred it to a parliamentary standing committee on the opposition's demand. The committee had on February 26 submitted its report to the Parliament, suggesting certain amendments in the Bill. Since the government accepted most of the suggestions of the standing committee, it did not face any opposition to the Bill in Lok Sabha. The legislation will extend to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir.</text>

	<text>MANGALURU: A beach sleepover party organized last weekend to celebrate the academic success of two CA students at Panambur has the potential to become the next big tourism idea. Panambur beach has the highest average daily footfalls in Karnataka. The beach, managed by Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project (PBTDP), doesn't need additional marketing, for its clean and sandy shores have proved to be its USP. A brainchild of Giridhar Kamath, the sleepover was primarily intended to celebrate the success of his daughter Malavika and friend Latha clearing the CA exams. In fact, while in college, Giridhar used to frequent the beach with friends and indulge in star-gazing. Those memories came back when he with his friends from the Youth Hostels Association of India, Team Mangalore and other like minded people, pulled out all stops to organize this maiden sleepover. A group of around 200 family friends landed at the beach around 8pm on Saturday fo games, music, group acting spot interviews, poetry session, impromptu talent display and a campfire. A cool sea breeze added to the fun and frolic of the gathering from al age-groups. Of these, around 40 stayed back for the sleep over, pitching tents or just using bedsheets as they indulged in star-gazing on a full moon night. Chill and mosquitoes can be a problem though. Yatish Baikampady, CEO, PBTDP, who played an integral part in organizing this sleepover, told TOI that it could well spell the revival of a night beach safari that the authorities toyed with two years ago. "The only hitch is the constantly changing direction of sea breeze could leave those coming for the sleepover open to stifling humidity, chill and mosquito bites," he said. "We took turns sleeping in the tents or out in the open using bed sheets. Stray dogs and mosquitoes ensured we had a sleepless night," said Gayathri Bhat, a medical professional. Nonetheless, this impromptu idea will spur PBTDP to come up with a fullfledged night beach safari during winter and spring, he added.</text>

	<text>SYDNEY: As many as 70 crocodile heads were found dumped and left to rot in a freezer in a small town in northern Australia, media reported on Tuesday. A group of children found the freezer that had been left behind a local shop at a small town called Humpty Doo, 40 km southeast of Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), reported Xinhua. Authorities said at least 50 crocodile heads - but as many as 70 - had been stuffed inside the freezer. NT national parks and wildlife officers have joined the investigation. Crocodiles are considered a protected species in Australia and anyone convicted of killing the animal faces a fine of $55,779 or five years in jail. A limited number of permits are issued each year for local hunters to kill or remove crocodiles that pose a danger to the community. Crocodile skin is incredibly valuable in the global fashion industry.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: As many as 175 countries, including India, China and the US, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, to coincide with 'International Mother Earth Day'. This was the first day of the signing ceremony of the historic global deal. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar signed the agreement on behalf of India. The agreement aims to take multiple measures to save the world from disastrous consequences of climate change and was adopted by 195 countries in Paris on December 12, 2015. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and some heads of state and government, including French President Francois Hollande addressed the gathering. Also on the list of speakers was Mahindra Group chairman and managing director Anand Mahindra, as a representative of the business and corporate world. That such a large number of countries signed the agreement in a single day is significant. The previous record for the most countries to sign an international agreement on one day was set in 1982, when 119 countries signed the 'Law of the Sea Convention'. The agreement will be open for signature for one year - till April 21, 2017. However, merely signing the agreement will not make it operational. At least 55 countries, that account for an estimated 55 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions will have to ratify the agreement before it enters into force. Only 15 countries - mostly small island nations - on Friday submitted their instruments of ratification, indicating a long road ahead before the Paris Agreement becomes operational. France, the first country that signed the agreement on Friday, promised to ratify it by this summer, while the biggest polluter, China, announced to do it before the G20 summit in September in Hangzhou. China's move may encourage other G20 members, including the US and India, to quickly join the agreement by ratifying it. US secretary of state John Kerry, while addressing the gathering, announced that his country is looking to join the agreement this year. India has so far not indicated when it would ratify it. Many big countries are likely to wait for the US, as it had not ratified the Kyoto Protocol (the first global agreement to fight the menace of climate change) despite signing it in 1998. Since the US goes to Presidential elections in November, it is expected that the country's ratification may revolve around politics, as Republicans had never been enthusiastic of such a deal in the past. Since the Paris Agreement is neither a treaty nor a binding protocol, the Democrats' US government won't need to go to the Republican-dominated Senate for its ratification. Though a Kyoto Protocol-like situation is not expected this time, many countries do not appear to be sure whether the Republicans, if they come to power, would support such global action to cut emissions and take other measures, including financial support to developing countries, by contributing money to the Green Climate Fund. Under Article 21 of the Agreement, the Paris accord will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) deposit their "instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession" with the depositary at UN headquarters. The Paris deal is the most ambitious climate change agreement in history. It established a long term, durable global framework to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions where 195 countries will work together to put the world on a path to keeping global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius. These countries had also agreed to pursue efforts to limit the increase in temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. All the countries have, for the first time, committed to put forward successive and ambitious 'nationally determined' climate targets and report on their progress towards them using a rigorous and standardized process of review.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Giving a major fillip to its Ganga rejuvenation efforts, the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) - a central body to implement the government's Namami Gange scheme - has approved projects worth Rs 2446 crore for development of 'ghats' and crematoriums at various places along the river in four states and along its tributary Yamuna in Delhi. The projects will be implemented along the river stretch from Haridwar to Uttarakhand border, Garhmukteshwar in Uttar Pradesh, Buxar, Hajipur and Sonepur in Bihar, Sahibganj, Rajmahal and Kanhaiya 'ghat' in Jharkhand. "These projects have been carved to improve the facilities of 'ghats' and crematoria for reduction of pollution into the river. All the projects will be implemented under centrally sponsored scheme of Namami Gange. The central government will bear 100% costs", said an official statement. All these projects were approved by the Empowered Steering Committee (ESC) of the NGRBA on Tuesday. The ESC is chaired by secretary, ministry of water resources and has members from the ministries of environment and forests, finance, urban development and power and representatives from state governments of the five Ganga Basin states -- Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. The project is also meant for afforestation along the banks of river Ganga. However, additional fund of Rs 2294 crore for afforestation under 'Forestry Intervention in River Ganga' scheme of the Centre will be approved later. The ESC on Tuesday also appraised the 'Detailed Project Report' (DPR) on the 'Forestry Intervention in River Ganga'. The project will focus on augmenting water flow along with abating the pollutants in river Ganga through appropriate forestry intervention along the banks of river Ganga. The major project components are implementation of forestry interventions in five states, strengthening knowledge management and national capacity for forestry interventions and conservation of rivers and scaling up and replication of successful models of forestry interventions and riverscape. Seeking to rejuvenate the river Ganga through massive plantation exercise, the Centre had in March released the DPR on forestry intervention for the river which will see the five states to plant trees on 83,946 sq km of identified diverse forest areas over the next five years. The project, which is to be implemented during 2016-21 in its first phase with an estimated cost of over Rs 2,294 crore, will help in absorbing water and dealing with soil erosion. As many as 40 types of plants with high water retention capacity, including several shrubs of medicinal value, have been identified for this purpose. The plantation drive will be funded by the Centre under its 'Namami Gange' programme. The same model will later be replicated elsewhere in the country for water conservation through tree plantation drive. Experts believe that the plantation of trees, like walnut and oak, having high water retention capacity will increase the river's water level and enhance its flow in the long run. Plantation along the river and all over the available stretches of land in the Ganga basin is a key component of the 'Namami Gange' programme which was launched last year as a comprehensive approach to rejuvenate the river.</text>

	<text>BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh forest department is considering a proposal to fell over 550 trees to make way for a tiger safari in its Pench national park, known as home to 'Mowgli', a fictional character and protagonist in English writer Rudyard Kipling's 'The Jungle Book'. The forest department has started working on a project to create tiger safari in the park straddling Seoni and Chhindwara districts of the state. It has been proposed to erect a boundary wall which would require pruning of shrubs and felling of 556 trees, according to an order issued by Pench national park's authorities. However, the plan has got stuck for want of permission of Delhi-based National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The decision to cut 556 has, however, been criticised by wildlife activists who termed it as a violation of rules. "We are against the creation of tiger safari inside Pench national park. There has been continuous cases of tiger deaths in Madhya Pradesh. The state government instead of taking steps towards protection of tigers is trying to reduce the green cover and increasing people's activities. The NTCA must reject this plan," said Ajay Dubey, on whose petition Supreme Court had in 2010 banned tourism inside tiger reserves. Pench national park or tiger reserve is known world over as home to 'Mowgli'  a man-cub said to have been spotted there. The park, sprawling over 758 square kms, is located on the southern boundary of Madhya Pradesh, bordering Maharashtra. It has 299 sq kms core area of Indira Priyadarshini Pench national park and the Mowgli Pench Sanctuary. The remaining 464 sq km is the buffer area. There are six tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh  Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Panna, Bori-Satpura, Sanjay-Dubri and Pench  which have about 257 big cats. While the tiger population in the country was estimated at 1,706 in 2010, it had risen to 2,226 in 2014. Madhya Pradesh ranks third  after Karnataka and Uttarakhand  in tiger population in the country.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: As majority of the countries signed the Paris Agreement last month, everyone is waiting for its ratification by big players like the US, China, India, Brazil and the EU. Amid hope of its early implementation, the French ambassador for climate change negotiations, Laurence Tubiana, said France will ratify it in June and hoped that the global agreement to take action to face the challenges of climate change would come into force way before 2020. In an email interview to TOI, she explained how it is now important for the world to take the promised actions to limit the global average temperature increase below 2 degree Celsius or below 1.5 degree Celsius, if possible, quickly. She also spoke about importance of public-private initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance and Mission Innovation in which India has played a leading role. Excerpts: What will be the next step after signing the Paris Agreement when the road to its ratification still looks tough in view of the US Presidential election? Last month in New York, 175 countries signed the Paris Agreement. This is a new world record: the highest number of signatures in one day for any international agreement, not just on the environment. After the adoption of the Agreement in Paris on December 12 last year, it sent another very powerful signal about the international community's strong resolve to limit the global average temperature increase below 2 degree Celsius or 1.5 degree Celsius if possible, transition to a zero-emission and climate-resilient economy, and achieve sustainable and just development. The next step is ratification. For the agreement to enter into force, we need it to be ratified by at least 55 countries representing 55% of global GHG emissions. Several countries have already ratified the Paris Agreement, including many small islands and developing states, which in my view is a very important symbol. And several others, representing 39% of global GHG emissions, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Philippines, the US and 10 countries from Africa, have expressed their intention to ratify this year. This has built momentum for the early entry into force of the agreement, which I am sure will happen way before 2020. When will France\EU ratify the Paris Agreement? France will ratify the Paris Agreement by the end of this parliamentary session, in June. It is very important for us, as the Presidency of COP21, to be part of the first acting countries. For the EU as a whole, it will inevitably take a bit longer, because it needs to agree on the details of the burden-sharing agreement among its member States before it can ratify it. The slow speed of the EU institutional processes can be frustrating at times. But on the other hand, it is important that there is a serious domestic debate about the implications of the Paris Agreement, and that we take time to build consensus at the national and regional levels. Because this is what is most important for the effective and sustained implementation of the Paris Agreement. How can the developed nations win the trust of their developing counterparts without their pre-2020 action? Increased pre-2020 action is indeed essential to keep open the option of limiting the global average temperature increase below 2C, or even lower, to 1.5C. Developed countries have an important role to play in this regard, particularly by mobilizing the 100 billion USD of climate finance per year by 2020, which will enable developing countries to raise the level of ambition of their mitigation and adaptation actions further. For developed countries that are party to the Kyoto Protocol, the ratification of the Doha amendment on the second commitment period of the KP is also an important matter. But all countries should think about ways in which their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) can be revised, including pre-2020, because, collectively, they are insufficient to put us on a plausible path to 2C or 1.5C. The facilitation dialogue in 2018 will play an important role in this regard, and that's why it would be really beneficial if countries came to it with a national strategy for mid-century low-emission development consistent with the temperature goal and sustainable development objectives. For countries to be able to increase the level of ambition of their emission reduction targets, the cost of technologies will have to decrease further, as well as the cost of capital. That's why public-private initiatives, in which India has played a leading role, such as the International Solar Alliance and Mission Innovation, are so crucial. What would be the role of the UNFCCC in the overall implementation of the Paris Agreement? The global framework agreement we adopted in Paris was a great success, a truly historic success. But Paris was only a turning point, and now the hard work begins: the actual implementation of the Paris Agreement; but also raising ambition even further, to make sure we limit the temperature increase below 2C, or 1.5C if possible, because the current set of nationally determined contributions are not sufficient yet. The facilitative dialogue in 2018 will play an important role in this regard, as along with the global stock-take - for both actions and support - after that. We need to shift from negotiation mode to cooperation mode. This is the main challenge looking ahead. We need to tap into the potential for international cooperation on policy, finance and technology. We need to transform NDCs into policy and investment plans, and make sure they are supported when needed. The UNFCCC Secretariat will have to adapt to this new phase, as well as continue its role of facilitating the negotiation process itself. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is looking for some kind of taxation regime to deal with the emission in aviation sector. What is your take on it from the French or the EU perspective? The ICAO issue is indeed an important and a tricky one. Emissions from the international aviation sector are already significant, and rising fast. There is no way we can address the climate change and sustainable development challenges without addressing the source of these emissions, which are excluded from the scope of the Paris Agreement. The airline industry is, in many respects, a global industry, and emissions from this sector cannot easily be attributed to a particular country. But in the meantime, there are important national circumstances to be taken into account when addressing this issue, including the fact that all countries are not at the same level of development. But the industry showed the way by committing to limit its emissions to the 2020 level. So governments must now follow up, and find a way that works for all. Not just to offset the emissions from the sector, but to actually reduce them through the development of new technologies. If we managed to agree on a global climate agreement, I see no reason why we cannot address this much more limited issue. But we must do it this year, otherwise the window of opportunity will close. But the prospects for reaching an agreement are rather good.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Pointing out how the work of Ganga rejuvenation is getting delayed due to multiplicity of implementing authorities, the parliamentary Committee on Estimates - chaired by the BJP Lok Sabha member Murli Manohar Joshi - on Wednesday suggested setting up an apex body, headed by the Prime Minister, for better coordination and implementation of all the schemes of the cleaning of the country's national river in a time-bound manner. The Committee suggested that the apex body should also be backed by a legislative framework with statutory power to take decisions on all aspects of river rejuvenation projects -- whether it is land acquisition for sewage treatment plants, maintaining uninterrupted flow of the river or regulation of water withdrawal for industrial, agriculture and domestic use. Speaking on the report of the Committee on Estimates (2015-16), Joshi also flagged as to how construction of dams has become a major stumbling block to the river cleaning exercise as it had affected the natural flow (ecological flow having self-cleaning properties) of the river and suggested that the government should not go ahead with any hydro-power project till the Supreme Court takes a call on the issue. "Damming of the river is quite harmful. It is accepted world over that the dams are damaging the rivers", Joshi said. He also expressed his reservation to the government's ambitious plan of inter-linking of rivers and suggested extreme caution while going ahead with the plan. Joshi, former Union minister, said rivers can be inter-linked on small scale but it is not "practical" to go for large-scale interlinking at the national level. Claiming that thousands of kilowatts of power will be required to run pump sets to lift water from one end to another, he said, "It will require power and money. We are short of power as it is...how will water cross the Malwa plateau? Imagine the number of pumping sets required". He said, had it been practical, then nature itself would have done it. "The rivers would have been inter-connected. But it is not.....Different rivers flow\located in different environments (topographical regions)...So, one should be very careful while pursuing the inter-linking plan " Joshi, however, clarified that river inter-linking is not one of the subjects of the Estimates Committee. The government has identified 30 projects of inter-linking of rivers across the country. However, only three links -- Ken-Betwa, Damanganga-Pinjal and Par-Tapi-Narmada - have been taken up for implementation. Though all necessary works have been completed for linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, the actual works on the ground have not yet started due to absence of certain environmental clearances. Speaking about the apex body on Ganga rejuvenation, Joshi said the Committee noted that the gigantic task of river cleaning cannot be accomplished through a piecemeal and fragmented approach. Specifying need for making effective amendments in various environmental laws, the Committee, having 30 MPs as its members from different political parties, recommended that the ministry of water resources should take appropriate action expeditiously so that a "strong, comprehensive and credible legislative framework is put in place envisaging, among others, the creation of an empowered overarching authority to deal with all aspects of Ganga rejuvenation and for maintaining the pristine purity of the Ganga it is revered for". Joshi said the Committee submitted its report to the Parliament with its recommendation on Wednesday. "Now, it is for the government to act upon it", he said.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Union minister Maneka Gandhi has sought education loans on concessional rates for girl children in an effort to promote their education. The women and child development minister has made the request in a letter to HRD minister Smriti Irani and finance minister Arun Jaitley. The WCD ministry, in conjunction with the HRD and health ministries, runs the NDA's flagship 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme which aims at ending female foeticide and promoting the education of girls. In her note to Irani, Maneka wrote, "When it comes to sending children for higher education, parents often distinguish between girls and boys... The girls often get denied the privilege of higher education or specialised courses only because parents do not wish to take a loan for their daughter's education." She added that while other interventions were being looked at, a "small incentive" could be a concessional rate of interest on education loans.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: In what could possibly be a rare example of passing a bill by both Houses of Parliament the same day, both Rajya Sabha andLok Sabha passed the Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University Bill on Wednesday. Even President Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent to it the same day  making it a rarest of the rare case in Parliamentary history. The legislation, meant for upgrading the existing Rajendra Agriculture University (RAU), Pusa, Samastipur in Bihar as a central university, gave the state its first central agriculture university. "The central agriculture university is a big gift for the people of Bihar. It has fulfilled their long pending demand", said the Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. Bihar, happens to be the minister's home state, recently also got the Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Motihari. Singh told TOI: "It is honour to the state which got two central universities, including one central agriculture university, in the name of two great men  Mahatma Gandhi and Rajendra Prasad". The legislation, a historical one for Bihar, will also be remembered as one of the rare Bills which could not only be passed by both houses of Parliament on the same day but also got the President's assent the same day. "Passing of a bill by both Houses of the Parliament on the same day can be done by waiving of rules (like giving minimum time to members of other House to vet it through prior notice). After all, House is the master of the Bill. If a House decides to take up a particular bill the same day, it can take it up", said PDT Achary, constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general. Asked by TOI to recall any other Bill which might have been passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the same day, Achary said though couple of Bills might have been passed in similar situation in the past, he could not recall any such case at least in recent past. The Bill was first passed by the Rajya Sabha and hours later, the Lok Sabha also approved it unanimously without any discussion on Wednesday. Since the Lok Sabha was to adjourn sine die on Wednesday itself, the minister was keen to get it approved. The bill was introduced in the Upper House in December last year. According to new legislation, the headquarters of the university will remain in Pusa, Bihar. It will have powers to establish campuses at such other places within its jurisdiction as it may deem fit provided the university should integrate the existing campus and other associated facilities of the RAU.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: For the first time, college and university students will have a say in evaluation of teachers as the Smriti Irani-led HRD ministry has decided to bring fundamental changes in the way the performance of those in the teaching profession is assessed. The process of changing the present criteria of Academic Performance Indicators (API) scores, which relied heavily on co-curricular activities and research in the evaluation of teachers has been initiated and a notification will be issued soon, officials said. "As per the new norms, students who have an attendance of 75 per cent will be able to give feedback of their teachers. The predominant weightage in evaluating teachers has been given to their teaching, learning and evaluating capacity," a senior HRD ministry official said. Explaining the reason for bringing this change, the official said that under the previous criteria of API scores, a 30 per cent weightage was given to co-curricular activities and another 30 per cent to research. Many teachers' bodies have agitated against the API system which was introduced in 2010 as it was often perceived to be not fair. "The result of making research an essential component on the basis of which a teacher would be assessed and promoted, was that a lot of substandard in not very significant journals took place. Moreover teachers who focused more on teaching than say on extracurricular activities like refereeing a basketball match sometimes found themselves at a disadvantage," another HRD official said. In several colleges, including many in rural areas, the adequate support for research is not there, officials said. We have reduced the rigidity of the previous system and decided that co-curricular activities and research would be measured separately as well as together and there will be no capping in research. Activities like presentation of paper on various subjects will also be given weightage. "The main focus of the changes that we are bringing in this criteria is that a teacher's performance should be linked with - how well does he teach," a senior HRD official said.</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: Team India director Ravi Shastri harped on team effort as the hosts prepared in earnest for the World T20 championship. "We don't talk about individuals. No individual can win you a big tournament... For that to happen, seven-eight individuals need to perform consistently," he said on Wednesday , the eve of the team's first warm-up match against the West Indies at Eden Gardens. "Virat (Kohli) is in outstanding form, and so is Rohit (Sharma)... MS (Dhoni) has done well lower down the order, Yuvraj (Singh) has struck form, Shikhar (Dhawan) has had his moments," Shastri said while spelling out individual brilliance which has contributed to the team's phenomenal run this year in the shortest format of the game. Shastri felt it was good to have most of the big players in form going into the mega event. "We have got into a good habit of winning games. You might get the odd hiccup on the way . But it's important to maintain a level of consistency and treat every game as an important game," Shastri said, pointing out the importance of warm-up games before the tournament. After the West Indies game, India will play another practice tie, against South Africa in Mumbai on Saturday, before launching their WT20 campaign against New Zealand in Nagpur. Shastri believes the Indian team has now the right blend of youth and experience. "Any good side needs balance between youth and experience. If you look at history, the world No. 1 sides would always have experience and youth. The youngsters bring energy to the table and keep the seniors on their toes while they too want to emulate the seniors," he explained. The former India captain is actually happy to have a `good' headache of not being able to fit in players like Ajinkya Rahane and Harbhajan Singh in the playing XI regularly . "That's the criteria of a good team -its bench strength," Shastri pointed out. "Players like Harbhajan and Rahane can get into any team in the world. So it's a good problem to have," he quipped. Shastri was all praise for Kohli, who is in the midst of a fabulous run. "Every time he bats, you can see passion written all over. You can see his body language, he just loves the big stage. He wants to compete against the best in the world," the former India captain said. He took a dig at critics calling for skipper MS Dhoni's head. "I've said long back that he (Dhoni) is the best. What else is left for him to be achieved... but there will still be people who want him to retire. This is normal in our country. You go after your champions," he lamented.</text>

	<text>The Indian women's hockey team will return to the Olympics after a long gap of 36 years having qualified for next year's Rio Games, courtesy England making it to the final of the EuroHockey Championships. The team spoke with Rohit E David on the challenges they'll face in Rio and their preparations for the Olympics. Now that the team has got a Rio berth, how will it prepare for the big event? Monika, Midfielder: We were adamant this year that we will qualify for the Olympics and we have achieved that. This achievement brings with it a bigger responsibility and we are aware that we have to stand up to it. The challenge ahead will not be easy as all top teams will be featuring in the Olympic Games and we know we have to take the level of our game higher and for this we are ready to work hard and be focused each day for the next whole year. Sunita Lakra, Defender: We have to be focused on the challenge ahead and not let the pressure to get the better of us. We have already started working on our strategies and we have to work on them basis the opponents during the Olympics. Lilima Minz, Midfielder: We have one year's time till the Olympics and we will work on our grey areas. We know we have a tough road ahead. I think we need to work on our defense for the Rio Olympics. We don't want our opposition to penetrate our circle freely. With the help of coaches like Mathias Ahrens, Helen Mary and CR. Kumar we are working thoroughly on our defense. Namita Toppo, Defender: We will analyse every minute of the game and build strategies accordingly so that we do not make mistakes during the tournament. Team coordination will also be our focus as that will be the key. We need to have enough confidence as a team and this will come with rigorous practice sessions. We will keep in mind the strengths of individuals and plan our game accordingly so that it helps us achieve our goal. Is there anything you feel the team needs before the Rio Games? Monika: While each one us is dedicated from here we will need to be more dedicated towards our goal. have to be open and ready to play from different positions. This will be helpful as incase there is a scenario that we have to step into someone else's shoes we know our role instantly. Vandana Katariya, Forward: The need of the hour is practice and practice every day. Even playing more tournaments will help us understand where do we lack and how best to work on the grey areas. Sushila Chandu, Defender: We need to work on our fitness and prepare mentally to absorb the pressure. We will work on concreting on our defence and creating goal scoring opportunities. European teams are physically dominant over the Asian contenders. With Mathias Ahrens, our chief coach, the team is concentrating on the overall fitness. We are trying to pace up our moves and stamina so that we can play the whole 60 minutes with the same speed. Ritu Rani, Midfielder: It's not every day that we get to play the Olympics and now that we have earned this opportunity we have to make it count. For me I will strive to better my play and make myself stronger which will help handle the pressure situations. We need to practice harder and work on our delivery as a unit. What we need is the support of the nation and their belief that we can make it happen. Do you feel that in India more importance is given to the men's team? Monika: That depends on how you take the situation. We have always associated hockey, football and cricket as a men's game and hence this feeling that they are giving more importance. While it is not so because had that been the scenario we would not have got so many opportunities to play and feature in international tournaments. Poonam Rani, Forward: I never felt any difference. Both the teams get equal importance among people. Those who love hockey, they come to see our matches too. Vandana: Yes the men's team has an edge because of their recent feats but I don't think they are given more importance. What are some of the differences you have noticed between men and women team that should be bridged? Monika: There is no difference between the teams. We are given equal opportunities like them. I think we could have a few more tournaments, which will help us better ourselves as we face this new challenge. Sushila: Both the teams are getting proper attention from Hockey India. We are getting the same facilities as the men's team. Right from coaching staff, support staff, accommodation during preparation camps all are same. Deep Grace Ekka, Defender: The men's team has superior defending skills and I feel that we should learn from them. While playing, they cover the whole ground which is very helpful to keep the ball possession and which we need to learn and inculcate. The men's team have got a hockey league, do you feel that women's hockey league is the need of the hour? Lilima: Yes. Players from all over the world participate in these leagues and which gives one a huge platform to play alongside the best players. Also leagues even give you young players who then make it to international arena. Rajani Etimarpu, Goalkeeper: I would be glad to have any good opportunity that comes to me as it will help me grow and a League of course would be a big platform. Savita, Goalkeeper: Definitely, various sports leagues in India have enhanced the game and people are moving beyond cricket. And with no doubts even the men's team has benefited from the Hockey India League which has not only allowed the players to play on an international platform but also have helped them to learn the International game style. The women's team will also love to play in such a league which will help us to develop our skills in a much healthier way. Sunita: Yes it is. A league anywhere allows the players to have a bigger environment to learn from. Whom would you prefer - an Indian or foreign coach and why? Monika: We practice under both. We have Mathias Ahrens as Chief Coach, Roelant Oltmans as High Performance Director, CR Kumar as the Coach, so you can see that there is no dearth of experience from where we can learn and grow. I think very few teams would have this kind of back end support and we are lucky. Vandana: It is the coach that matters and the value that he or she adds. So discriminating between a foreign and an Indian coach will not be right. Sushila: It hardly matters. Nationality has nothing to do with the coach. It's all about how our team grasps what the coach is teaching and how the team is responding to the style of play that the coach expects from us. Namita: Both Indian and foreign coaches have their own set of lessons to teach. Both are an asset for us with their experiences and uniqueness which comes to us as a gift from them. While the foreign coaches have new techniques which can be tried to improve our game, the Indian coaches understand our mind and comfort level and how these techniques can be implemented keeping the same in mind. Rajani: Both Indian as well as foreign coaches have their own style of training us and presently we are learning different aspects from both which has helped us improve our game. Savita: I personally prefer Indian coaches as he would have a better understanding of the Indian game style. But learning from Roelant Oltmans, Mathias Ahrens and in the past Neil Hawgood have helped us learn better techniques hence their presence has been a boon for us. How did you start playing hockey? Lilima: I started playing hockey in my hostel in Odisha. After successfully getting selected in trials, I realised I had a bright future in hockey and that's what acted as a driving force to my dreams. Managing studies and sport at the same time was a problem for me. Namita: That was a sudden decision. Everyone in my family insisted me to play hockey and when I got selected in the trials, since then there was no looking back. Rani Rampal, Forward: I started my hockey career from Shahbad. As it is very famous for hockey, I had developed a liking for the sport from that place itself. Many players have evolved from Shahbad and I always wanted to experience that fame and feeling of pride and so chose hockey. Monika: My initial interest in hockey was developed by my friends. They often used to talk about this game and this developed a curiosity in me to know more about the game. What were some of the challenges you faced as a hockey player? Monika: My only concern was the financial factor. Being a sport whose equipments are expensive, it was difficult for me to get the best equipment for undergoing training. Also health supplements were expensive so monetary problem was the main concern for me when I started to play. Vandana: My parents at a point of time didn't support me to play hockey and asked me to stop playing. It was my dedication towards the game that dug the courage inside me and motivated me to play hockey. Rani: The biggest challenge I faced while playing hockey is being a girl. A female is not given that preference and this is what created a hurdle in my decision to choose hockey as a profession. Also, making my family believe that hockey is the career I am looking forward to was most challenging. Even financial constraint was a challenge to a girl like me who is not that financially strong. Whom do you look up to as a hockey player? Monika: My inspirations are the senior players who took our nation to the Rio Olympics. They are my idols and I learn a lot from them. Vandana: My coach in Haridwar and Lucknow were my prime inspiration during my early years. There support and hard work has paid today that we are playing for our country. Sunita: My inspiration is the captain of the India national men's team- Sardar Singh. Savita: I'm really motivated by PR Sreejesh (goalkeeper, men's hockey team). He has helped me to understand the art of goal keeping in a better way. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>The surging Los Angeles Clippers shrugged off the absence of forward Blake Griffin and center DeAndre Jordan by easing to a 104-90 victory over the Miami Heat at Staples Center on Wednesday. Backup center Cole Aldrich, who started in place of Jordan, scored 19 points and grabbed seven rebounds, while point guard Chris Paul had 15 points, 12 assists and six rebounds, sparking the Clippers to their 10th consecutive victory. Forward Paul Pierce and guard Jamal Crawford scored 15 points apiece for Los Angeles (26-13) with the former also collecting nine rebounds. Griffin missed his ninth contest with a partially torn left quad tendon but Jordan's absence was a surprise before the game when it was revealed he had pneumonia. His withdrawal ended Jordan's NBA-leading consecutive games streak at 360. Guard Gerald Green scored 19 points to lead the Heat, who lost their third in a row. Dwyane Wade finished with 16 points and eight rebounds, while forward Chris Bosh had 11 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for Miami (22-17). Heat guard Goran Dragic missed the contest with a calf injury. Initially, Miami did not seem to miss a beat without Dragic, leading by as much as 16 in the first half before Los Angeles cut the deficit to single digits. A 9-3 run to close the half allowed the Clippers to pull within 52-45 at the break. Los Angeles rallied despite shooting only 39.2 percent to 52.5 percent for the Heat. However, 11 turnovers by the Heat to only three for the Clippers in the first half did not help their cause. Overall, the Clippers shot 42.6 percent to 44.3 percent for Miami. Los Angeles drained 11-of-25 (44 percent) from three-point range to 9-of-24 (37.5 percent) for the Heat. In the third quarter, the Clippers opened with a 24-5 spurt, which included a 13-0 run, for a 69-57 advantage after an Aldrich hook shot with 6:11 left. Los Angeles led 79-69 heading into the final period after they out-scored the Heat 34-17 in the third. A 10-2 run to kick off the fourth quarter blew the game open for the Clippers.</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: The captains of India, Sri Lanka, Ireland and Bangladesh women's cricket teams flashed their best smiles as they posed with the ICC World T20 Trophy. Then came the introductions. When the stylish Bangladesh skipper was introduced by the moderator as "Ayasha Rahman", there were no raised eyebrows. But the young Bangladeshi, with heavily-kohled eyes, spoke up."I'm not Ayasha Rahman," she said, her eyes darkening, "My name is Jahanara Alam." That's something that slipped between bat and pad, but that's women's cricket. Few know the players, fewer still watch them play. They may not play to the gallery , but they play because they are passionate. It is this passion that will be on display when the 10 women's teams play in the World T20, starting with a warm-up game between India and Ireland on Thursday. Three-time champions and holders Australia may have lost back-to-back home series against India and New Zealand, yet they are tipped to take back the trophy . Having said that, the aura of invincibility around the Australia team has faded. Add to that the exposure to competitive T20 that players from West Indies, New Zealand, England and South Africa have got in the Women's Big Bash League, and the Australians will have a task on hand. But India skipper Mithali Raj, who led the team to a series win against Australia in January this year, still believes the team from Down Under will be tough to beat. "Last edition's champions Australia will be tough contenders. Though we have beaten them in Australian conditions, the World Cup is a different scenario," she said. Sri Lanka's Sashikala Siriwardene agreed on Meg Lanning's team being the hot favourites but Ireland captain Isobel Joyce put her money on New Zealand, led by the formidable Suzie Bates. Jahanara, on the other hand, believes the hosts are serious title contenders. "I support India. For my team no team is tough. If we believe we can do, we can do. But I will pick India."</text>

	<text>RANCHI: People say absence makes the heart grow fonder. On the eve of the second qualifier here on Friday, it was found that not only the love for IPL was greater this year among the fans, getting the chance to watch a qualifier has injected more enthusiasm. Missing out on league matches has turned to be boon. Not only the fans, CSK management is also happy to get IPL engagements back to their captain's hometown. Asked if the familiar surrounding at captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's backyard will hold any advantage, CSK coach Stephen Felming said, "I hope so. We played a lot last year here obviously and it was key part of that season and some emotional connection because of skipper's home town. So we are hoping it will be good for us. "But we know it's not all. When it comes down to competitive matches, I guess it's just the improvement from the side to make sure we do the job, it doesn't matter what surroundings you are in. If you don't play well enough you won't get the goodies. So we got to play well." Interestingly the fact that tickets are sold out may not guarantee a fullhouse. Some had booked the tickets hoping they will get to see Mumbai Indians and thus, former stars Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Jonty Rhodes, who have retired as players, here. "Watching Dhoni vs Virat will be a treat for us. Dhoni didn't play in last match (India vs Sri Lanka ODI in November) here. We will get to see him tomorrow. But I wanted to see Mumbai here because of Sachin, Jonty and Ponting. They don't play now, so this was the chance to see these greats of the game here. Unfortunately we missed the chance. Many of my friends and acquaintances had booked tickets anticipating Mumbai Indians would play here," Pratap Kumar from Chutia said. However, Mumbai or no Mumbai, a cracker of a match awaits Ranchi in the sweltering heat with a promise to send the mercury higher.</text>

	<text>The celebrations said it all. When Vijay CC defended their TNCA elite first division title against Jolly Rovers for the second successive year at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here last month, the players were understandably ecstatic. The match provided a ringside view of the competitive nature with which the league has been contested for years. "It was a highclass match which went down to the wire. Both teams were in it till the very last minute and I believe that's what the league encounters are all about," pointed out R Prasanna, skipper of Vijay CC. Each game has seen its share of top performers - both from the state and outside. The presence of non-Tamil Nadu cricketers in numerous teams has played its part in raising the overall standard of the league. "Someone like Piyush Chawla, who has played for India, knows what it takes to excel in the game. He plays mentor to our bowlers and that has obviously benefited the local players in the team. Players from outside have a huge role to play," says Jolly Rovers skipper Hemant Kumar. The bigger question is - what brings these players to Chennai? For any nonstate cricketer, playing in the TNCA league provides a competitive environment where they test their cricketing skills and also enjoy a host of other benefits. "There is a strong corporate backing for the clubs who feature in this league. The likes of Sanmar Group, India Cements, MRF and numerous corporates support teams, which is a huge advantage. These firms ensure job opportunities which can be a big boost for cricketers who can then concentrate on performing on the field," says Chawla, who is on the payrolls of Chemplast. Rajasthan's Robin Bist, a regular face in Jolly Rovers, feels the high-class infrastructure too has its role to play in the league in attracting talent from outside. "Jolly Rovers has its own ground to train and that's the case with most of the teams which play in the first division league. Not many leagues across India can boast of such high-class infrastructure," he says. Haryana's Jayant Yadav, who turned up for Jolly Rovers, felt the TNCA league acted as an ideal preparation ground ahead of the domestic season. "It is vital to have practice matches when you are beginning the season. Since most parts of the country witness rains in the months of July and August, playing at the TNCA division league is an advantage since the weather is clear here. That's not all. Most clubs have state cricketers regularly featuring in their ranks, and bowling to them, this automatically notches up the level of the game," points out Yadav. Bharath Reddy, who has been part of Jolly Rovers for long, feels the non-state cricketers have brought a new dimension to the league circuit. "It helps them to understand what the league is all about. For the local lads - it is a classic case of seeing where they stand when they either bowl or face these players who come from outside," says the former Indian cricketer. They may arrive here not being fully versed with the conditions, but non-state players have over the years gone on to make a mark on the ground here.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Banned from all cricket-related activities in India by a Supreme Court committee headed by former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha, Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra had his heart in his mouth in 2013 when Delhi Police started probing him, but he ultimately left the Capital smiling. The special cell of Delhi Police, which unearthed the 'spot-fixing' racket and stumbled upon franchise owners/officials indulging in betting, questioned Kundra, got confirmation of his betting from his business partner Umesh Goenka but didn't book him. For the special cell, it was tricky to book Kundra under the Gambling Act as there was no "solid evidence", then commissioner of police Neeraj Kumar, who spearheaded the IPL cleaning campaign, had said. Kumar went on to say that Kundra "had confessed to placing bets on his team" and that "he had lost a lot of money on bets". Delhi Police had claimed that Kundra placed bets through Umesh Goenka. During his questioning, Kundra reportedly told the police that "being a British national, he was unaware of the fact that betting was illegal in India". Delhi Police didn't want to get involved in 'betting' cases as their Mumbai counterparts were probing these at the time with the arrest of Vindu Dara Singh and Gurunath Meiyappan. Instead, the Delhi anti-terror sleuths shot off a letter to Rajasthan Police about possible involvement of Kundra in betting, leaving the ball in their court. Neeraj Kumar, who is now part of BCCI's anti-corruption unit, had said, "We don't have evidence against Raj Kundra, so can't arrest him." In fact, the special cell had found while examining Goenka that even Kundra's wife Shilpa Shetty had placed a bet of Rs 1 lakh during one of the matches in IPL 6. These allegations were never brought by Delhi Police on record. Sources said Delhi Police's investigation report and statements were used by the Justice R M Lodha committee while giving its verdict on Tuesday. Reacting on his suspension, Kundra said on Wednesday that he was "wronged", while terming it as "unfair" that the whole team was "harshly treated" for the actions of one individual. "Today is a very depressing and sad day for me as my integrity has been questioned and my support in this investigation seems to have backfired. While I have great respect for the Supreme Court and the judicial system, unfortunately, in this case, I cannot but feel that I have been wronged," Kundra said in a statement.</text>

	<text>MUMBAI: Indian grandmaster Aravindh Chithambaram emerged as the winner in the open category of the Asian Junior Chess Championship being held in New Delhi on Wednesday. In a thrilling final round, overnight sole leader GM S L Narayanan drew with International Master Mousavi Seyed Khalil. This helped Chithambaram to catch up with Narayanan after defeating Nima Javanbakht of Iran. Both players were tied at seven points but direct encounter tie-break helped Chithambaram to clinch the title, while Naryanan had to be satisfied with the runner-up position. Harsha Bharathakoti completed the all-Indian podium finish after defeating International Master Mosadeghpour Masoud of Iran. In the girls section, it was Mongolia's Uurinntuya Uurtsaikh who clinched the title but not without much drama. Uurtsaikh pulled off an emphatic victory over top seed R Vaishali to lift the winner's trophy, while Nandhidhaa P V finished runner-up after defeating overnight joint leader K Priyanka. Vaishali did not find a place on the podium as Ivana Maria Furtado won the bronze medal by securing final round win over Bala Kannamma P. In the blitz discipline, Naryanan won the gold medal while Arjun Kalyan and Chithambaram secured silver and bronze medals respectively. Vaishali secured the yellow metal in girl's category, while Varshini finished second and Kannamma won bronze. Deputy chief minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia, gave away the prizes to the children.

	<text>NEW DELHI: Rahul Dravid could be seen wearing a coach or a mentor's cap in the upcoming IPL season. The legendary batsman, who was associated with the suspended Rajasthan Royals franchise till last year, is in talks with Delhi Daredevils who have let go the services of Gary Kirsten this year. It is learnt that Dravid is not averse to the idea of joining an IPL franchise after having finished a long season with the India `A' and India Under-19 teams. According to sources, talks between Dravid and Daredevils have reached an advanced stage. "Dravid is keen to take up the role of a mentor but he is reluctant to be full-time coach. He has had a long season starting with the India 'A' team in June and he just got free after the ICC U-19 World Cup last week. He wants to spend more time with his family as well," a source close to the development told TOI adding that the only point of contention from Dravid's end is the amount of time he will be able to give to the franchise. While Daredevils management didn't want to commit on his name, it did concede that Dravid was an option. A decision is likely to be taken in a fortnight. "Things are in a speculative stage. We have a few other names going around as well. Dravid is definitely one of them. At this point, it's difficult to commit as the owners of the team are not in the country. Once they return, a final call will be taken," a senior Daredevils official told TOI. There is a theory going around that Dravid and the core of former Rajasthan Royals management helped Daredevils put together a revamped team this year. The team has a fair sprinkling of Rajasthan like Karun Nair and Sanju Samson who have been bought for high prices along with South African Chris Morris. There are three players in Rishabh Pant, Khaleel Ahmed and Mahipal Lomror from the India U-19 team which played in the World Cup in Bangladesh. Khaleel was apparently hand-picked by Zaheer Khan who doubles up as player and bowling coach at Daredevils. "Zaheer has identified Khaleel as one with potential and he can be worked on during his stay with the franchise. Pant was being followed for six months since he played the U-19 challenger tour nament," the DD official revealed. Under Dravid's captaincy, Royals made it to the last four of IPL twice. He also led the team to the final of the Champions League T20 in 2013.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK: Jerome Valcke denies "fabricated and outrageous" allegations that led to his suspension as FIFA secretary general, his US-based lawyer said in a statement on Thursday. "Jerome Valcke unequivocally denies the fabricated and outrageous accusations by Benny Alon of alleged wrongdoing in connection with the sale of World Cup tickets," a statement from New York attorney Barry Berke said. Valcke, 54, had been accused of taking kickbacks by Alon over a deal with FIFA to sell tickets for the 2014 World Cup. However his laywer's statement said Valcke "never received or agreed to accept any money or anything else of value from Alon." "As has been reported, FIFA entered into an agreement with Alon's company, JB Sports Marketing," the statement said. "That agreement and FIFA's subsequent business dealings with Alon were vetted and approved by FIFA and its legal counsel."</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Two years ago, the Delhi Police special cell was listening into a few calls being made from Pakistan to Dubai. They had little idea that they were on the verge of unearthing one of the biggest rackets in Indian cricket. On March 26, 2013, one of the callers (923333206****) mentioned words like "league", "over" and "rates". The cops, especially the then commissioner of police Neeraj Kumar, got suspicious as the underworld men were discussing cricket in such detail and decided to dig further. It turned out that as many as three players of Rajasthan Royals were involved in something called "spot fixing", the new way to fix matches in intervals. The mammoth operation involving the police agencies of Mumbai and Rajasthan as also the Enforcement Directorate led to the arrest of over 50 people in different states, including players, their agents/managers and bookies. READ ALSO: Rs 200 fine, one month prison for Meiyappan? The Delhi Police had put some numbers on surveillance in a different case when they stumbled upon the conversation in question. Around 9.32pm on the aforementioned date, a Pakistan-based caller spoke to someone in Dubai for 108 seconds. Delhi Police, with the help of intelligence agencies and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), got the caller's voice examined through layered voice analysis tests and found it to be that of none other than Dawood Ibrahim. Dawood was using code words in the calls with his aide, later identified as Javed Chautani. Later, a Delhi bookie, Ramesh Vyas, also got a call from the same number. READ ALSO: Raj Kundra almost got off the hook Delhi Police then began intercepting the calls of some other bookies, including Ashwini Aggarwal alias Tinku Mandi and Ramesh Vyas, and eventually unearthed the tweaked and latest version of match fixing  spot fixing. This method involves fixing parts of the match  say, players being asked to give away a pre-determined number of runs in a given over  to affect the verdict. The first instance of spot fixing was established on May 5 in a Pune Warriors versus Rajasthan Royals match. On May 9, inspector Badrish Dutt of the special cell registered an FIR in this connection. A day later, Dutt was found dead along with his girlfriend in his Gurgaon flat in what is believed to be a murder-suicide.

Six days later, pacer S Sreesanth and two other Rajasthan Royals, bowlers Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan, were arrested from Mumbai in a clandestine operation by a Delhi special cell team. Even though the Delhi Police came across some more big names from the cricketing world while examining accused persons, and senior officers muttered names in off-the-record briefings, they were never probed for lack of solid evidence. READ ALSO: Judges topple Kings, Royals The operation shocked the entire nation and the special cell went on to arrest more than 30 people. Several controversies have erupted since then, but the case it seems, reached its logical end on Tuesday when former CJI R M Lodha banned Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years for their alleged misconduct.

	<text>NEW DELHI: Indian boxing star Vijender Singh's maiden title bout, scheduled to be held here, has been postponed by a month to July but the trailblazing pugilist on Saturday said he will not take any break from training as it would upset his rhythm. Vijender, who beat Poland's Andrzej Soldra via Technical Knockout in Bolton on Friday night to register his sixth successive win, was originally scheduled to fight for the WBO Asia title on June 11 here. However, the big event has been pushed back by a month due to logistical reasons. "I am really looking forward to the India bout, it is going to be a huge moment for me to step inside the ring in front of my home fans. And that is why I am not going to take any break from training because I want to be at my best. It is technically not good either to take a break as the body has to remain in rhythm," Vijender told PTI in a telephonic chat from Manchester. The opponent for that much-anticipated contest is yet to be finalised. Vijender said after spending a week in India, he would head back to Manchester. "Even while I am in India, there won't be a proper break, I would be training daily because I cannot be completely away from training. I would be celebrating my wedding anniversary on May 17 there before I come back to Manchester to continue my preparation for the India bout," Vijender said. "I would have loved to train at home for this bout but facilities are better in Manchester, so I will have to head back," he added. Reflecting on last night's bout, the 30-year-old Haryana lad said Soldra was more accurate than his previous opponents. "He connected better, certainly, but I relied on power. I was looking for that one powerful blow which would knock him off. I managed to strike that in the third round when he lost his balance," he said. "Even in the recent Amir Khan vs Saul Canelo Alvarez fight, Amir was doing fine for some time but Canelo knocked him off with a solid one eventually. This is what I did as well," he explained. Asked about the powerful right jabs that have been instrumental in his victories so far, Vijender said, "I don't use it early. It's for that final assault after softening them (rivals) up with combinations."</text>

	<text>Regardless of the fact that India is out of the World Cup, India's World T20 campaign has been a Virat Kohli show. Even as India lost the semi-final to the West Indies, Virat's performances earned him laurels from pundits and fans alike. While Virat fever gripped India, one neighbourhood in West Delhi has a more personal interest in the Indian vice-captain's performance. Meera Bagh, where Virat grew up and learnt to play cricket the way he does, turns into 'Virat Vihar' every time India plays. 'Woh ab India ka Virat hai' As we take an auto from the Janakpuri East Metro station to Meera Bagh on the evening of the semi-final, we ask the autowallah if he knows that Virat Kohli used to stay here once. He replies, "Humein nahi pata tha ki woh yahin rehte thay. Lekin bahut achha laga sunke ki woh yahaan ke rehne waale hain. Virender Sehwag bhi toh yahin paas ke Na jafgarh ilake ke hain. Virat ke liye toh kya hi bolein. Ab woh sirf Meera Bagh ke Vi rat thodi na hain, poore desh ke Virat hain." Crowd outside the Kohli house at 'Virat Vihar' The Kohlis used to live at A-43, Meera Bagh, before moving to Gurgaon last July. Even though the family doesn't live there anymore, the house still bears the Kohli nameplate and neighbours say that Virat's brother and mother visit the house every now and then. The house, something of a landmark in the locality, still manages to draw a few curious 'tourists', particularly on days when India is playing. Most people in Meera Bagh have a Virat anecdote to share. A guard at the A-block en trance tells us, "Pehle toh bahut log aate thay poochne ki Virat Kohli ka ghar kaunsa hai. Ab unke jaane ke baad thoda kam hua hai, par phir bhi match ke time ek-do log aaj bhi aa jaate hain." A crowd of 10-12 youngsters had gathered outside A-43 as India's innings gathered pace on the day of the semifinal and Virat started to hit those boundaries. Pankaj, the guard at Virat's building, says that the crowd used to be much bigger when the family stayed there. "Ab toh ginti ke hi log hain. Pehle toh itne aate thay ki dhakka maar ke hatana padta tha. Har match ke time yahan 50-100 logon ki bheed jama ho jaati thi," he says. Listening to the match score on a pocket radio, he adds, "Yeh colony toh famous hi Virat Kohli ki wajah se hai, sab 'Virat Vihar' bolte hain." Residents recall that after the 2011 World Cup victory, there was a sea of people outside the house to congratulate the family. Kuldeep Malik, a resident, says, "When India won the 2011 World Cup, there was a loudspeaker blaring from Virat's house about the win and there was a huge crowd outside his residence. The RWA had put up a big screen in the park also." 'Haar-jeet nahi, humko Virat ki batting se matlab hai' As India ended its innings, there were fireworks all around Meera Bagh. For the residents, it was more of a celebration of Virat's innings than India's score. "Humko haarjeet se matlab nahi. Apna Kohli achha khela hai, wahi kaafi hai," a boy standing outside Virat's residence says. Rahul Sharma, a driver standing nearby, adds, "Woh WhatsApp forward toh dekha hi hai na? Poore team ko Baahubali ki tarah utha rakha hai Virat ne. Hum ko uski batting se matlab hai bas." AK Bedi, a neighbour, says, "When the family was here, there was a buzz when he used to return after playing some series. Even Anushka (Sharma) visited the house a few times, the next door neighbours tell us." Sunita Bedi, his wife, adds, "Inna sona khela Virat ne. Aur log bhi utna achha khel lete toh jeet jaate." Even though India lost the match, for the residents of Meera Bagh, Virat was still the star. Sahiba Juneja, a university student who stays on the second floor of A-43, says, "I met him three years back.We hadn't moved here yet, but I had come to see our house. When my friends got to know that I stay in the same build ing as Virat, they were like, 'Please milwa do. Please get us his autograph.' Now all the hoopla has reduced and the autograph re quests have also stopped ever since the family moved to Gurgaon."</text>

	<text>Kevin Durant turned the conversation back to the court and away from his impending free agency with a final-second jump shot that lifted the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 117-114 victory over Orlando Magic on Wednesday. With daily reports focusing on Durant's possible departure from Oklahoma City following this season, the All-Star forward provided a timely reminder that his loyalty at this moment remains with the Thunder. Oklahoma City and Orlando were locked at 114-114 when Durant pulled off a nifty cross-over dribble and fired a three-pointer that found the bottom of the basket with less than a second remaining. Prior to fending off Magic defenders, Durant had spent much of his time shaking off questions about potential new suitors. "It's out of my control. Guys are going to write stories about what they want to write about (and where I could go)," Durant told reporters prior to scoring 37 points in Wednesday's game. "(The free agency talk) is ramped up a bit. I just try to stay locked in to where I am." Durant, 27, has spent his entire career with the Thunder franchise dating back to their days in Seattle before they moved to Oklahoma City in 2008. But after failing to win an NBA title alongside running mate Russell Westbrook, speculation has mounted that Durant could ply his trade elsewhere and there are no shortage of rumoured suitors for the four-time league scoring champion. He has been linked to the Washington Wizards, Los Angeles Lakers, and most recently, the defending champion Golden State Warriors, in various stories swirling around him. "It's just a part of this (free agency) process," Durant said. "When the time comes we'll talk about it. Right now I'm 100 percent locked in to helping (the Thunder) be the best we can be."</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: The city is ready for the razzmatazz but will the gods play along? The question haunted organizers, Bollywood stars, fans and cricketers on the eve of the grand IPL-8 inaugural ceremony at Salt Lake Stadium. With Nor'westers lashing the city for the second day running, everyone is keeping their fingers crossed for a rain-free spell on Tuesday evening. That though would be nothing short of a miracle. The Met office has predicted another thunderstorm on Tuesday evening, prompting fears of a washout. Tickets for the high-decibel evening  starring among others Hrithik Roshan, Anushka Sharma, Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Frahan Akhtar  sold out within hours of counters opening . READ ALSO: Hrithik, Shahid to perform in IPL 8 opening ceremony "Tuesday will see the formation of another cluster of thunderclouds. Therefore, there is every chance of rain," said Devendra Pradhan, deputy director general Indian Meteorological Department. If the rain arrives towards afternoon or early evening, organizers of the glitzy jamboree could still hope to salvage the show. But a late-evening thunderstorm may just kill the programme that includes floor projections, lazer shows and explosive dance routines. According to the Met, the cyclonic circulation over Gangetic West Bengal currently extends up to a kilometer above sea level and is bringing in copious quantities of moisture, triggering cloud formation. Strong winds are turning these into thundershowers, the intensity of the downpour depending on the height of the cloud and volume of moisture within. Such a thundershower struck the city on Monday evening accompanied by hail in some areas. A cluster of tall cumulonimbus clouds extending up to 18 km had resulted in heavy rain in Kolkata on Sunday. The height of the cloud was lower at 13 km on Monday. Though this cloud cluster will dissipate on Monday night, the cyclonic circulation will remain active and hence moisture incursion is expected to continue. As a result, rain clouds will again gather on Tuesday with the possibility of another thundershower towards afternoon or early evening. The only hope is that the intensity and duration of the rain could be less than what the city experienced on Sunday. "I am keeping my fingers crossed for fair weather on both Tuesday and Wednesday. Not just the inaugural event, I also hope to catch the opener between KKR and Mumbai Indians. I do hope rain does not play spoilsport," said Aryan Bagaria of Bangur Avenue. Rain apart, there are traffic concerns, too, for fans travelling to Salt Lake Stadium. A rally by Left Front on Tuesday afternoon is likely to choke traffic in the city centre. The rally from Mahajati Sadan to Esplanade will start at 3.30 pm and will have participants walking from vantage points like Sealdah and Howrah, creating massive congestion.</text>

	<text>KARACHI: Facing criticism for Pakistan's dismal show in the ICC World Twenty20, Shahid Afridi today stepped down as captain of the team but will continue to play in the shortest format of the game. The Afridi-led Pakistan failed to make it to the semifinals of the World Twenty20 in India, where his comments also drew the ire of former players. The 36-year-old all-rounder and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had hinted that World T20 could well be be his last as skipper. "Today, I wish to inform my fans in Pakistan and all over the world that I am relinquishing the captaincy of the T20 Pakistani team of my own volition," Afridi said in a statement, released on his twitter account. "On this day, I thank Allah (SWT) for His Kindness and Mercy which enabled me to discharge my leadership duties, to the best of my abilities for the sake of honour and prestige of my motherland. For me it was a great honour to lead my country in all three formats of the game," Afridi wrote in his statement. Afridi, however, asserted that he will be available for selection as a player in the team even though PCB Chairman Shaharyar Khan has made it clear that the all-rounder is no longer a surety in the side. "My profound thanks to the PCB and its Chairman Shaharyar Khan who gave me the honour to lead the national team. I would also like to inform that InshaAllah I intend to continue to play the game for my country and league cricket etc. and request my fans for kindly keep praying and supporting for my best future performances for Pakistan (as a player); and in all other arenas of the game, world over." The mercurial cricketer played 27 Tests for Pakistan before retiring from the format in 2010 with 1716 runs and 48 wickets. In 398 ODIs, he has 8064 runs and 395 wickets, while 98 T20 International appearances have fetched him 1405 runs and 97 wickets. Afridi found himself mired in controversies during Pakistan's World T20 campaign. First, he drew flak in Pakistan for stating that he and his players were loved more in India than back home. Later, Pakistan lost three of their four group stage games, including a high-voltage clash against arch-foes India, to bow out of the tournament. Amid the dismal on-field run, Afridi stirred up another controversy by specifically thanking Kashmiris for cheering his team in Mohali. The remark was criticised by the BCCI with Board Secretary Anurag Thakur saying that the cricketer should avoid making political statements. Post the World T20 debacle, Afridi had sought forgiveness from the people of his country for failing to live upto their expectations. "I don't care what other people say about me but I am answerable to you (people of Pakistan). I, Shahid Afridi, seeks forgiveness from the people of Pakistan for not living upto the expectations that you had from this team and me," Afridi had said in a brief video message on his Twitter page.</text>

	<text>NEW YORK/ZURICH: Major soccer sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for the immediate resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the most significant move by companies supporting the sport since a bribery and corruption scandal erupted at world football's governing body last May. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) , McDonald's (MCD.N), Visa (V.N), and Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), companies that have long linked their brand names to soccer, on Friday demanded Blatter step down immediately in a strong push for change at the organization. Blatter earlier announced he would resign in February next year. The sponsor statements, all using similar language, came just a week after Swiss authorities said they were opening a criminal investigation into Blatter, the 79-year-old Swiss national who has lead FIFA for the past 17 years. AB InBev said it has been "actively engaged" in the FIFA reform process as part of a group of sponsors. "Every day that passes, the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish," Coca Cola said. "FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach." Visa and McDonald's joined the call for Blatter to step aside. "The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership," McDonald's said in an emailed statement. Blatter responded by saying he would not resign, setting the stage for a battle over who should take the helm in the next few months before February when elections are set for a new FIFA president. In a statement from his U.S. lawyer Richard Cullen, Blatter said he believed leaving office would not be in FIFA's best interest or advance the needed reforms of the organization. Scandals surrounding global soccer exploded in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on U.S. charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery schemes that dated back decades. Last Friday, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General said it opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. It was the first time that authorities investigating corruption in the world's most popular sport had pointed the finger directly at Blatter. He has denied wrongdoing and his U.S. attorney said he was cooperating with the Swiss probe. FIFA's awarding of the 2018 and 2022 competitions to Russia and Qatar is one of the strands under scrutiny from U.S. and Swiss authorities investigating corruption in the organization, a worry for tournament sponsors including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Visa. "One of the things consumers are looking for in brands today is for them to be responsible," said Trevor Wade from the brand consultancy firm Landor. She said the moves by the sponsors was a way to take a public stand about something they think matters to customers. It is an unprecedented decision by companies that have largely stood back as developments in the case unfolded in recent months, said Jaimie Fuller a co-founder of campaign group #NewFifaNow. "The drastic nature of this call stresses the extreme problems faced by FIFA," Fuller said, "and should show everybody how the sports governing body is teetering on the abyss."</text>

	<text>LOS ANGELES: Former tennis world No.1 Maria Sharapova said on Monday that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she has been taking the last 10 years for health issues. The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, tested positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1. "I received a letter from the ITF (International Tennis Federation) saying that I had failed a drug test at the Australian Open ... and I take full responsibility for it," Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel. "For the past 10 years, I have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor ... and it also has another name of meldonium, which I did not know. "It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance." Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. The stunning news came a day after Sharapova's management team said she was going to make a "major announcement," which had many speculating that she was going to announce her retirement from professional tennis. "I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down. I have been playing since the age of four a sport that I love so deeply," said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. "I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game." Sharapova, who has struggled with a series of injuries in recent years, has not competed since she lost to Serena Williams in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January. "I was first given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues I was having back in 2006," said Sharapova, who according to Forbes earned $29.5 million in 2015. "I was getting sick a lot. I was getting the flu every couple of months. I had irregular EKG results. "I had a deficiency in magnesium and a family history of diabetes, and there were signs of diabetes. That is one of the medications, along with others, that I received." Read this story in Telugu</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Lodha Panel verdict which has recommended suspensions to IPL franchises Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, the BCCI announced the formation of a working committee during their meeting in Mumbai on Sunday. The six-member committee, decided by IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla will study the impact of the sentence and make recommendations to the Government Council after a time period of six weeks. IPL Chairman Rajeev Shukla said the members of the group would be finalised by Monday. "House has entrusted me with the responsibility to make a small group that will take six weeks to submit a report as to how we implement the order and way forward for IPL. How to conduct IPL, how many teams and all stakeholders CAC members, sponsors, broadcasters, state associations, legal experts that report will come to GC and it will go WC which will take decision," Shukla said. "Members will be announced tomorrow [Monday]. We have decided to implement Justice Lodha verdict in spirit and decided to work accordingly. All stakeholders have given their opinion, everybody is of the view that the show must go on. And I reiterate that IPL 9 will be bigger and greater," he asserted. Shukla refused to reveal the details of the meeting and took at shot at former BCCI President Shashank Manohar for his demand of terminating the two franchises. "We cannot divulge the deliberations of the meeting. A sub-group has been constituted which will recommend what needs to be done. A Supreme Court-appointed committee has deliberated on it (the IPL scandal) and after it has given its verdict, I don't think there is scope for anybody else to comment," he said. The Council met in order to deliberate the order passed by the Lodha Committee and came up with the following minutes (according to BCCI's Press release) -: - BCCI respects the verdict of the Lodha Commission and will abide by their decisions, in totality. - The members recognised that there is an urgent need to understand the impact of this decision and the wider ramifications for BCCI in detail, so as to uphold the paramountcy of the game in our country. - The IPL GC hence authorised the Chairman, Shri Rajeev Shukla, to constitute a working group which will study this verdict, in consultation with all our key advisors and explore all the possible measures to be adopted, with an objective to protect the interests of all the stakeholders involved. - This group will work within a time bound period of 6 weeks and report their recommendations to the IPL GC, which will deliberate and share their views with the working committee of the BCCI, for further action.

	<text>KUNSHAN (China): After clinching a historic bronze medal in the last edition, the Indian women's team, led by Saina Nehwal , will eye another good show but it will be an uphill task for the depleted men's team at the Thomas and Uber Cup badminton tournament starting on Sunday. Indian women had reached the quarterfinal for the first time at the 2010 Uber Cup in Kuala Lumpur but it was only in 2014 in New Delhi when they clinched their maiden bronze after going down 2-3 to five-time champions Japan in their maiden semifinals appearance. Indian women's team have been clubbed with 2014 runners-up Japan, Australia and Germany and once again the onus will be on Rio-bound shuttlers Saina and P V Sindhu to earn them wins in the two singles. The choice of the third singles player will be among Ruthvika Shivani Gadde, Tanvi Lad and P C Thulasi. In a format comprising of three singles and two doubles, once again it will be 2010 Commonwealth Games champions Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa -- both have booked their Rio berth -- who will carry the responsibility. Besides, there will be N Sikki Reddy and K Maneesha for the second doubles. Indian women will face Australia in their campaign opener on Monday, before taking on Germany and the formidable Japan in the next two days respectively. In Thomas Cup competition, Ajay Jayaram will spearhead the Indian challenge while World No. 12 K Srikanth gave it a miss and H S Prannoy was left nursing a foot injury. In their absence, the onus will be on B Sai Praneeth , national champion Sameer Verma and his elder brother Sourabh to step up and take responsibility in the three singles. In the doubles, Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy, who became the first Indian men's doubles pair to qualify for the Olympics, will lead the challenge. Besides them, Akshay Dewalkar, young R Satwik Sai Raj of Andhra Pradesh and Mumbai's Chirag Shetty would complete the line-up. India has been clubbed in Group B alongwith Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong and though it seems like a relatively easy draw, the absence of top players will hurt India's chances to progress to the knockout stage in what is only their eighth appearance in the prestigious event. "Srikanth and Prannoy's absence will be a setback, but Sameer and Sai have had some encouraging results of late and hopefully we can step up to the task and get some good wins," Jayaram told PTI. Indian men will open their campaign against Thailand on Sunday and then square off against Hong Kong and Indonesia on Tuesday and Wednesday. "We are definitely in a tough group and getting through to the quarters is going to be an uphill task. All 3 group stage ties will be crucial. However, I believe that if we can get off to a good start by getting the better of Thailand it will be good moral boost," said Jayaram. "It's hard to pick out any particular match that we will rely on as it is a well balanced team and every member will play a crucial role in getting the team through." Since its inception in 1948-49, the Thomas Cup has been won by only four nations: Malaya/Malaysia, Indonesia, China and Japan while the Indian team failed to reach the knockout stage till 2006. In 2006, it was the men's team which broke the jinx by reaching the quarterfinals. In 2010, India lost to Indonesia 0-3 in the quarterfinals. In the last edition, India could not go beyond the group stage.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI/Kolkata: The BCCI brass went into a huddle on Wednesday following the suspension of the owners of two IPL franchises, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings, and considered various options before it, including one in which the board itself runs these two teams but only after putting them under the charge of veteran cricketers of unimpeachable credibility and working out a mechanism to give them full autonomy. This would be to ensure that no conflict of interest issues arise from the BCCI being the organizer of IPL and the owner of two teams. This option, among the three reported by TOI on Wednesday, seemed to have gained steam at a meeting between board president Jagmohan Dalmiya and board member and IPL commissioner Rajeev Shukla in Kolkata on Wednesday, sources told TOI. The eminent cricketers being considered for running the two teams included former Indian captains Sourav Ganguly, Sunil Gavaskar and Rahul Dravid, the sources said. The board members also considered the option of bringing in two new franchisees as there is a legal commitment to the broadcaster to run the tournament with a minimum of eight teams. A special sub-committee has been set up to handle the situation arising from CSK and RR's suspension and it was told by the members to consider the possibility of the two teams getting a reprieve when they go in appeal before the Supreme Court. The latter possibility has lent weight to the option of the BCCI running these two teams. In case the franchisees win a reprieve, and two new teams are created in the meantime, the board would be suddenly faced with a tournament of 10 teams for which it is not prepared. But if it decides to run these two teams as interim management, it can merely hand them over to the original franchise owners if and when that situation arises. The board taking over the two suspended teams as a temporary arrangement also has the merit of not needing any fresh auctions for players of the two franchises and therefore avoiding the uncertainty and disruption that the other options would inevitably entail for the players. In such an eventuality, the current CSK and RR squads would simply continue under a new management except for any players that may be traded in the IPL trading window later this year. Panel of experts The BCCI is mulling the formation of a panel of experts to study the Lodha committee report and suggest ways to implement its recommendations, Shukla told reporters at a press conference in Kolkata. "We are looking at all options and pick the one that suits us best...The BCCI will keep in mind interests of all parties involved in IPL."</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: The T20 format is said to be a batsman's game and the pitches generally tend to be batting friendly, but things haven't quite gone to script in WT20 so far. Most of the pitches provided for the tournament towards the end of a long Indian season have been as unpredictable as the format itself. Barring the Wankhede pitch in Mumbai and Pakistan's first match at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, none of the other surfaces have been belters facilitating hectic stroke-making. Both of India's matches have been played on turners, though the weather had plenty to do with the fact that the ball deviated, stopped and gripped at the Eden when Pakistan batted first on a moist strip, and could only post 118-5 in a rain-hit 18-over game. As India take on Bangladesh in a crucial encounter in Bengaluru on Wednesday, a win is a must but the margin of victory will also play a key role, given the fact that MS Dhoni and his men suffered a thumping defeat to New Zealand in Nagpur. With a net run rate of -0.895 after two games, a big win is what India will look forward to. The pitch at the M Chinnaswamy stadium has usually aligned with batsmen, and the same was expected on Sunday in Sri Lanka's contest with West Indies. But the pitch turned out to be sluggish and offered a fair amount of turn. According to people in the know, India too can expect the same at Virat Kohli's IPL 'home' ground. West Indies' lead attacker on the night, Andre Fletcher, was surprised by the way the surface played. Fletcher, who scored an unbeaten 64-ball 84, had his rough moments against the spinners, but made batting look easy otherwise. He later said: "The ball started spinning a lot. It was a bit difficult, as the ball got older. The (Sri Lankan) spinners bowled very well. Once you give yourself a chance on this wicket, you can make up in the end." As the victorious Windies prepared to leave for their next match against South Africa in Nagpur, Fletcher added, "We won't be playing any more games here, so the other teams will have to look at the pitch and see what they can do." Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews wasn't really surprised with the surface and felt the pitches were quite in tune with the weather. "In India generally, there has been no mercy for the bowlers. But this time, we see the spinners coming on pretty quickly and they are coming into play quite often. These are Asian conditions - whether you play in Sri Lanka, India or Bangladesh, this time of the year it will be the same kind of wickets. Mumbai is a different story. Mumbai has a little bit of bounce and pace. But in all other parts of India, it's quite slow and low. Especially in this season, the wickets are much drier. It is a challenge that we have to face. All batsmen need to face the challenge and the bowlers also need the chance (to flourish) on these types of wickets," he explained. India may start overwhelming favourites against Bangladesh, but will have plenty to tackle beyond the opposition.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: One of the key players for Dabang Mumbai, young Indian forward Nikkin Thimmaiah today said he is excited to rub shoulders with renowned German striker Florian Fuchs in the Hockey Indian League (HIL) next season. On cloud nine after fetching USD 67000 during the HIL player's auction, Thimmaiah said he is overwhelmed by the response shown by the franchises. "The price is really unexpected and it was an emotional moment for me as it made me realise that my work is getting recognised," said the Bengaluru-lad, who is remembered for his hat-trick against Australia in the 2015 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, where the striker helped his team to register a 4-2 win in the 3rd/4th Classification Match. "I had wonderful days with Uttar Pradesh Wizards and I am thankful to the franchisee and coaching staff to give me ample opportunities to showcase my talent," said Thimmaiah. As part of Dabang Mumbai, the 24-year-old from Karnataka, who had been a key player of UP Wizards for last two seasons, will now share the dressing room with Gurmail Singh, Danish Mujtaba, Harmanpreet Singh along with Australian midfielder Matthew Swann and Irish goal-keeper David Harte, besides Fuchs, in the upcoming editions. "I am very happy to see the world's best forward Florian Fuchs of Germany in my team and privilege to play with him for the next two seasons," said the talented striker. "I am very lucky to be in the same team as Florian Fuchs, Matthew Swann, David Harte, Gurmail Singh, Danish Mujtaba and Harmanpreet Singh. "I am looking forward to the upcoming season. What is the most exciting is the new regulation. It is yet to be seen who will take the most advantage of this," Thimmaiah added. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>Kobe Bryant scored eight points in what is expected to be his final NBA game in Oakland but it was not enough to prevent the Golden State Warriors from beating the Los Angeles Lakers 116-98 for their 37th consecutive home win on Thursday. Point guard Stephen Curry bombed in 24 of his game-high 26 points on three-pointers, helping the Warriors (37-3) record a seventh straight home victory over the hapless Lakers (9-32). The Oakland fans treated Bryant like one of their own, however, rather than the one that got away in the 1996 draft, during a lengthy pre-game introduction. The Warriors selected North Carolina State center Todd Fuller 11th overall 20 years ago, two spots before Charlotte took Bryant and dealt him to the Lakers. He responded with a poor shooting night, though, going just 4-for-15, but he did find time for six rebounds, three assists, two steals and a blocked shot in 27 minutes. Bryant's eight points were far less than the 27.1 average he accumulated in his first 32 visits to the San Francisco Bay Area. He managed only two points in the third quarter while the Warriors were extending a three-point halftime advantage to 86-72 going into the fourth. Curry had a hoop and two assists in a 13-2, quarter-closing run as the Warriors won for the third time this season in games that immediately followed a loss. Golden State fell 112-110 at Denver on Wednesday. Curry finished 9-for-18 from the field overall and 8-for-16 on three-pointers. Reserves Shaun Livingston (17) and Leandro Barbosa (15) combined for 32 points for the Warriors, who improved to 19-0 at home this season. Power forward Draymond Green, who was rested for Wednesday's loss, had team highs in rebounds (nine), assists (five) and steals (three) to go with seven points. Golden State made half its shots in the game and 13 of its 33 three-point attempts. Los Angeles shot 44.4 percent from the floor, 4-for-24 from outside the arc. Point guard Jordan Clarkson had 22 points and backcourt mate Lou Williams added 21 for the Lakers, who were coming off a home win over New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday. The Lakers also got 14 points apiece off the bench from point guard D'Angelo Russell and power forward Julius Randle. Bryant was much more effective on the defensive end than on offense, limiting Warriors shooting guard Klay Thompson to 12 points on 4-for-14 shooting.</text>

	<text>COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's test opener Kaushal Silva was taken to hospital on Sunday after being hit on the head by a cricket ball while fielding in a domestic match. Sri Lanka Cricket said that Silva was struck during a match in Pallekele. His scans were clear, but he was flown to a hospital in the capital Colombo for further tests and observation, the cricket body added. Silva has played 24 test matches for Sri Lanka and scored 1,404 runs at an average of 31. ``Kaushal was fielding at short leg when he got hit,'' espncricinfo.com quoted national team manager Charith Senanayake as saying. According to Senanayake, Sri Lanka vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal ``swept right onto the back of Kaushal's head. He did take evasive action, but still the ball hit him.'' The website said Silva was wearing a helmet with additional padding, a design introduced for player safety after the death of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes after being struck by a ball on the head in November 2014. Sunday's match was part of Sri Lanka's preparations for its tour of England next month, with the first of three tests starting at Headingley on May 19.</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: It's not often that a team goes into a major tournament without any specific areas of concern. Team India are in that enviable position as they prepare for the World T20 championship with the first of two warm-up games, against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, here on Thursday evening. Having won back-to-back T20 series against Australia and Sri Lanka, followed by their sixth Asia Cup triumph with an all-win record last Sunday, the Men in Blue will look to maintain their remarkable momentum and consistency. India have a settled unit with all the batsmen among runs and youngsters Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya bowling well in tandem with veteran Ashish Nehra. On Thursday, though, the focus will be on Mohammed Shami, who was ruled out of the Asia Cup with a knee injury. The nippy right-arm medium-pacer's match exposure since last year's World Cup has been limited to a couple of domestic T20 matches for Bengal and a few club games.Yet, the team management has not given up hope and is trying to get him ready before India's tournament opener, against New Zealand in Nagpur on March 15. Team direc tor Ravi Shastri made it amply clear that the pacer is very much in India's scheme of things. "He will be playing tomorrow and we will have a look at how he goes," he said on Wednesday. Mahendra Singh Dhoni did say recently that it will be difficult to accommodate Shami in the playing XI, given the form of the quick bowlers. But the skipper and other members of the think tank will be wary of possible injury issues which could rule out any member of the regular playing XI anytime. Thus, it will be a big boost for Team India if Shami is declared fit for the tournament. "He will have to prove his fitness and the physio is working with him," Dhoni had said. The Bengal pacer bowled for more than half an hour at nets during the team's practice session at Eden on Wednesday afternoon. He took it easy to start with, before bowling from his full run-up and at his usual pace not long after. He shared one of the nets with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pandya, as the trio bowled to Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli. He dislodged Rohit's off stump once as Shastri watched from behind. He tried the yorker a few times, which was appreciated by Kohli. Nehra left the ground with an ice pack wrapped around his right knee. There was no official word on his fitness, and it remains to be seen whether the left-arm pacer plays on Thursday. The West Indies squad did have a weeklong camp in Dubai, but the two warm-up games here (the second one will be against Australia on Sunday) will give them the chance to finalise the combination for their opener, against England. Most of the players in this Caribbean side play T20 across the world in different leagues and have the potential to create a flutter if they can gel as a unit. Skipper Darren Sammy will look to do just that in the warm-up ties before going into the tournament proper.</text>

	<text>CHANGZHOU (CHINA): India started their campaign at the seventh women's Junior Asia Cup on a resounding note by humiliating DPR Korea by 13-0 here today. Without wasting much time, India's Preeti Dubey opened the scoring in the 11th minute before Jaspreet Kaur successfully converted a penalty corner in the 20th minute to take a 2-0 lead. India kept up the pressure and scored the third goal through a field effort from Navneet Kaur in the 24th minute. Captain Rani Rampal then scored a field goal in the 28th to make the scoreline 4-0 in favour of the Indians. Lily penetrated the opponents defence and smacked the fifth goal for India in the 31st minute followed by another field goal by Punam Barla as India went into halftime with a comfortable 6-0 lead. The Indians continued in the same vein in the second half and pumped in as many as seven more goals. Rani scored three more field goals in the 43rd, 44th and 46th minutes to register a hat-trick and hand India a 9-0 lead. Lilima Minz scored a brilliant field goal in the 51st minute before the Indians added three more goals to their account in the 52nd, 64th and 70th minutes respectively. The ongoing tournament is a qualification event for the FIH Junior World Cup (Women) 2016. India will next play Singapore tomorrow. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>KOLKATA: City's tennis aficionados will get a rare opportunity to witness the game's stars in action when Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Sania Mirza and the legendary Martina Navratilova play an exhibition match here on Wednesday. Titled 'Masters Kolkata', the event is part of the International Premier Tennis League's exhibition tour and the players next travel to Hyderabad and New Delhi on consecutive days ahead of the season of the franchise-based tournament beginning in Kobe on December 2. The build-up tour has its founder and Indian tennis legend Bhupathi teaming up with his former mixed doubles partner and current doubles World No 1 Sania in a rare engagement against Paes, who will play alongside the most successful women's tennis player of all time, Navratilova. Paes and Navratilova had won the mixed doubles title at the 2003 Australian Open and Wimbledon. The exhibition match will also see Bhupathi reuniting with Sania, with whom he had won two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles - Australian Open in 2009 and French Open in 2012. "Season 1 of IPTL brought Indian tennis fans closer to tennis akin to Grand Slam action like never before. Yet, not everyone was able to experience that action up close and personal. The understanding and familiarity between the four of us has resulted in Grand Slam finals appearances and titles won. This will only contribute to the quality of competitive tennis being played on this tour," Bhupathi said. On how the promo tour lines up with his vision for the IPTL, which will begin its second edition on December 2 in Japan, Bhupathi said, "The response from season 1 was overwhelming and season 2 can only exceed expectations. The addition of a new franchise and stars like Rafael Nadal and Leander joining the ranks will surely make for some wonderful tennis on the cards. "Ultimately it is about connecting tennis fans in India and Asia with some of the world's best across the singles and doubles format. This exhibition tour is simply a taster of what to expect from IPTL Season 2," Bhupathi added. It will also be a nostalgia of sorts for the city's tennis fans who relished the three editions of the Sunfeast Open from 2005-07 at the same venue of Netaji Indoor. The event did not take place thereafter as the WTA tier III event became an ITF event.</text>

	<text>SANTIAGO: Chile wrecked Lionel Messi's dream of a first international title with a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over Argentina to end their 99-year wait for a Copa America crown on Saturday. Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez struck the winning spot-kick for Chile, as the hosts clinched a 4-1 shoot-out victory when the game ended goalless after extra time. Sanchez chipped the decisive penalty down the middle past Sergio Romero to spark wild celebrations in front of a 45,000 capacity crowd at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago. Chile took control of the shoot-out when Gonzalo Higuain blazed his penalty over the bar before Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo saved Ever Banega's spot-kick. Argentina captain Messi, aiming to inspire the South American giants to a first international title in 22 years, could only look on distraught as Chile celebrated. The four-time world footballer of the year had repeatedly spoken of his desperation to win a title with Argentina after winning everything at club level with Barcelona. But the 28-year-old superstar was to suffer more disappointment, only 12 months after enduring another agonising extra-time defeat in last year's World Cup final against Germany in Brazil. Chile's win was their first ever victory over Argentina in the Copa America. "It is a dream come true. We have worked so hard for this," said Chile star Arturo Vidal. The midfielder said Chile had been determined to win the Copa America after exiting the World Cup last year on penalties. "We talked about it in Brazil that we were going to win the Copa America," Sanchez said. "This is really a great generation, we deserve this." Chile's Alexis Sanchez holds the Copa America trophy as he celebrates with his teammates following their victory over Argentina in their Copa America 2015 final soccer match at the National Stadium in Santiago. (Reuters photo) Chile's Argentina-born coach Jorge Sampaoli said his side had deserved to win. "We had to play a great game against one of the world's best teams for the quality of players," Sampaoli said. "We should have won in 90 minutes, but ended up getting justice." Argentina's players meanwhile were left pondering another heartbreaking loss. Midfielder Javier Mascherano has now played in three losing Argentina teams in Copa America finals, and was also a member of the team beaten in the World Cup final. "Three Copa America finals, three defeats; I can't explain the losing streak," a dejected Mascherano said. "We just didn't seem to have that little bit of luck that you sometimes need to have to win in finals. Is it karma? I don't know." Argentina coach Gerardo Martino meanwhile lamented his side's failure to take chances. "They were very clear chances that should have changed the outcome of the game," Martino said. Earlier, Chile had begun the final at a ferocious pace before Argentina gradually managed to gain a foothold in the game. While Chile pressed forward relentlessly and launched a series of forays into Argentinian territory, it was the tournament favourites who had the better chances in the first half. Argentina almost grabbed an opener in the 20th minute when Sergio Aguero met a Messi free-kick with a close range header that Bravo parried away. On the stroke of half-time Argentina probed again and Javier Pastore set up Ezequiel Lavezzi whose shot was blocked by Bravo. The second half followed a similar pattern, with clear-cut chances thin on the ground as defences remained on top. Sanchez went close for Chile on 82 minutes but hooked his volley just wide of the post. Argentina almost snatched a dramatic victory in the dying seconds with a well-worked move that began after Messi skipped clear of the Chile defence and released Lavezzi on the left flank. Lavezzi found Higuain - on for Aguero - at the far post but the Napoli striker couldn't finish from a tight angle and shot into the side netting as Chile escaped. In extra-time Sanchez almost punished a rare slip by Mascherano but shot over the bar. Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>Scrapping of the Special Area Games programme cut short the careers of Siddi athletes, many of whom were forced to look for alternative jobs. After years, plans of a relaunch have made the community hopeful again I won battles with demons who haunted our village; I fought with my parents, who were initially apprehensive of sending me to a city to pursue athletics. In my journey of becoming an international athlete, I fought as much on the track as I did off it, but in the end the system failed us. It stirred our passion and then sucked out our energy." As she sat in her modest South Western Railway quarters in Hubballi, Kamala Siddi's smile lit up the room, but the pain in her voice was hard to miss. Silence punctuated her sentences when the former international athlete spoke of shattered dreams, unconquered medals and a career cut short by government apathy. She's is among the many athletes from the Siddi community who were touted as India's Olympic hopefuls in the 1980s and 1990s, but were left to pick up the pieces of their lives after the government's ambitious Special Area Games programme was scrapped without notice. With the Sports Authority of India preparing to relaunch it, the community is hoping the government isn't making promises they can't keep. Again. Looking back at her career which started by running between Manchikeri and Chikotti villages in Yallapur taluk, Hubballi, Kamala said, "As children we were often told stories of ghosts in the forest between my village and school in neighbouring Chikotti. Out of fear, I sprinted to my school everyday, covering a distance of 1km. That fuelled my love for running." The turning point came in 1989 when Kamala was picked for the second batch of the SAG scheme. After a month of training in Delhi, the group of 40 campers was pruned to 20 and sent to Bengaluru for training. "Initially, it was smooth sailing. We were introduced to a new life in a city where we saw equipment and sportswear for the first time. We embraced it all with the hope of a bright future. But that faded with time," rued Kamala, who represented the country in 100m hurdles, long jump and high jump at events like the SAF Games. After serving as a constable in the Karnataka police department, Kamala quit in 1993 to join the South Western Railway, where she is the chief office superintendent in the electricity department. Kamala, who continued to run even after she embraced motherhood, finally gave up in 2003, but regrets the course of her career. "I didn't want to quit. I dreamt of being an Olympian, but without support it remained a dream. What makes it worse is that I knew I had the talent to make it to the sporting extravaganza. I hope no athlete ever goes through our pain. There is no bigger tragedy than the death of a dream," said Kamala, her eyes brimming with tears. Despite all the darkness, Kamala sees hope when she talks about her daughters Pratiksha, 12, and Nimiksha, 10, who coyly flank their mother as she talks about winning a gold, two silvers and a bronze at the 1994 World Police Games in Melbourne. "I want my daughters to realize my Olympic dreams but also want them to be well-educated because it's important to balance both," she said. A stone's throw away lives Siddi athlete Louis Ishant Brigi, who was among the first batch recruits. Brigi, a long and triple jumper has been through the grind of the system, and is not overly keen about his two sons taking after him. "I want my kids to concentrate on studies first. But I won't discourage them from taking up sport," he said. With the new scheme on the anvil, Brigi is willing to help. "When they started dropping athletes from camps, I quit the scheme before I was left in the lurch. I moved to Gujarat for 10 years from 1993; it was a tough life because of lack of planning on the government's part. About 10 of us were lucky to have jobs but the others returned to villages to become labourers and farmers. But I want to put all that behind and if they want, I'll be happy to coach at the new centre," he said. Olympic legend Emil Zatopek once said, "An athlete must run with hope in his heart and dreams in his head". This 400-year-old community is again living a dream with the hope of producing an Olympian.

	<text>SAO PAULO: Triple Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton put talk of his party lifestyle and fatigue to one side on Friday with the fastest lap in first practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix. The Briton, who had delayed his arrival in Brazil due to a fever and after a car accident in Monaco in the early hours of Tuesday morning, was more than half a second faster than Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton, who has never won in Brazil in eight attempts, was the only driver below the one minute 14 seconds mark with a best time of 1:13.543 on medium tyres at the anti-clockwise Interlagos circuit. It was the first time he had been fastest in a first practice session since Monza in September. Rosberg, last year's Brazilian GP winner who arrived in Sao Paulo fresh from his success in Mexico, was second fastest with a best effort of 1:14.062 ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, using the latest specification Renault engine, was fourth. With both titles already decided, Hamilton having won his third world crown in Texas last month, teams used the session to work on developments for next season with aerodynamic sensors prominent on bodywork. Mercedes drew a lot of interest for a prominent bulge on the nose that was rumoured to be an 'S Duct', a device helping to channel air from under the car to the top surface of the front section. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who was fifth fastest, had an off late in the session when his rare brakes locked into turn four and he tracked across the mud and gravel without further incident. Lotus reserve Jolyon Palmer, who will be one of the team's race drivers next year, was involved in the morning's other moment of near drama when his car was released from the garage into the path of McLaren's Jenson Button, who braked. Hamilton's return to form came after a day of headlines about his party lifestyle with the 30-year-old Briton -- whose helmet this weekend carries a tribute to his late boyhood idol Ayrton Senna -- recognising he had been overdoing things. "It was a result of heavy partying and not much rest for a week and a half," the Briton told reporters. "I am a bit run down. I have been non-stop and trying to fit training in at the same time and not getting a lot of sleep."</text>

	<text>The Buddh International Circuit resembled a giant carnival as trucks, singers, dancers, and thousands of fans thronged the arena for a truck racing event, a vibrant event in which Indian and international truck racers competed on the track. A number of stars visited the track to soak in the action and wish luck to the truckers. Cricketer Virender Sehwag interacted with the Indian drivers before the race, and said, "It's a sport of focus and risk and I am happy to see that Indian participants are here as well. This is not just entertaining but draws huge crowds as well." Narain Karthikeyan, the first Indian to race in Formula One, also made a comeback to the Buddh International Circuit, albeit as a spectator. "It's great that they have brought Indian drivers this time. The atmosphere is great and I love the buzz around here," he said. The cultural performances drew applause as a number of stars performed on makeshift stages atop trucks in the middle of the race track. The opening ceremony saw artistes displaying Oriental, Brazilian as well as ethnic Indian dance forms. Neeti Mohan kicked off the show by singing some of her hits, getting a capacity crowd in the grandstand to sing along. Rapper Badshah brought the house down with tracks like DJ Wale Babu and Chull. An energetic song and dance routine by singer Garima Yajnik capped the evening. Talking about the event, Neeti said, "I've never performed at something like this. The energy was crazy and the atmosphere electric. I wasn't expecting something of this scale, but this was tremendous." There was plenty of racing action as well. For the first time, the event featured Indian drivers, with the aim of taking Indian truck racing to the world. Twelve Indian drivers competed in two eight-lap races, with Jagat Singh and Nagarjuna winning their respective races. Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy gave away the awards to the winners. The race also saw participation from 12 international truck racers in a 20-lap final feature race. In the absence of defending champion Stuart Oliver, British racer David Jenkins pipped the duo of Richard Collett and Graham Powell to win the third season of the championship. Numerous collisions between Collett and Powell on the final laps helped Jenkins win his first title in India. Crashes and collisions were not uncommon in the event - Mat Summerfield, a hot favourite, lost seven places after his truck spun on a corner. Rohan, a racing enthusiast, said, "This was the perfect event because there was something for everyone. My girlfriend came here for the performance, and I came for the racing. Can't wait to be back here next year!"</text>

	<text>Bengaluru: Sunil Chhetri is a man who hates to lose  whether it is while leading the national football team and Bengaluru FC on the field, or while playing wagers with his teammates on his PlayStation. On Monday, however, Chhetri had a daunting task ahead of him that would challenge that trait  to win a point against the queen of Indian badminton, Saina Nehwal. "I hope she takes it easy," Chhetri said, as he sauntered in to the Karnataka Badminton Association courts. Saina had just finished cooling down after her morning practice session, but was more than happy to oblige the Indian captain for a quick sparring game. Chhetri, surprisingly, had all the right moves for a footballer who dabbled in badminton. In February this year, he had teamed up with Tarun Kona to take on India's top doubles stars Ashwini Ponnappa and Jwala Gutta and left onlookers impressed. This time too, Chhetri didn't disappoint. Beginning slowly with long rallies, the 30-year-old began leaping into smashes and powerful returns to unsettle his Hyderabadi opponent. Saina, however, stood rooted to her spot, calmly returning each shot with a smile. "It's not turning out as I thought," Chhetri huffed. But finally, the BFC striker did get a breakthrough, launching into a stray shot from Saina to finish with a venomous cross-court return. Chhetri let out a cry of triumph and a smiling Saina looked a bit ruffled. "Aapne toh shuttle hi tod diya (You've broken the shuttle)," the 24-year-old quipped. What followed was something that Chhetri probably had coming for him. The world No. 4 showed a glimpse of her real game, raining down smashes after smashes on Chhetri as the Blues skipper bravely stood his ground. "The last one went right through me," he said, as Saina's thundering shots whizzed past him. Chhetri finally called it quits, shook hands, congratulated Saina and handed her a personalized Bengaluru FC home jersey. "We are proud to have you as part of the BFC family. You must come to watch our matches and support us," he told the shuttler. Saina was in awe of Chhetri's talent in the sport. "I never expected he would play so well actually. He has good wristwork and nice smashes, mainly because he's powerful player. Obviously it will help both of us if we keep playing like this together, because both our games involves a lot of running," she said. So will this new association get her hooked to football? "I'm not a big fan of football. If I had to pick a favourite player, I'd say Cristiano Ronaldo because he looks good (laughs). But now after getting this beautiful jersey, I'll try my best to keep track of BFC's progress and support them. It feels great to be part of the team," said Saina.</text>

	<text>WROCLAW (Poland): India's compound archer Abhishek Verma will look to avenge his Asian Games gold medal loss when he clash with Esameli Ebadi of Iran at the Archery World Cup Stage 3 here tomorrow. Verma had to settle for a silver after losing the men's compound archery individual final of 2014 Incheon Asian Games against Ebadi. "My rank may be low but I'm taking on experienced archers with confidence. I've realised that the key to success it to remain happy. A perfect score will come automatically if you're happy. And I'm looking forward to the match tomorrow," the world no. 18 said. Verma said his motto would be to not think about the rival archer. "If I think about the other archer, I lose," Verma said. "If I win, I'll be grinning." Follow TOI Sports on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt; @TOISportsNews</text>

	<text>JAIPUR: After a woman and a man went missing from Jhalawar district headquarters on April 15, police arrested two youth, Wakar Khan, 22, and Aslam Ali, 25, residents of Kota cantonment. The two youth, both relatives of the man who is absconding, were charged under Sections 107 (abetment) and 151 (continuing assembly of five after being commanded to disperse) of IPC. Relatives of the youth say police has only been harassing the family of the absconding man since they have failed to trace the missing couple. The woman's father had lodged a complaint with the police in Khanpur, Jhalawar district. Relatives say the two arrested youth were held in confinement for about five days before formal charges were made. On Friday, the two were released on bail, but promptly arrested again. Firoz Khan, a relative of one of the two arrested men, told TOI, "The police officer is not even answering my calls any more. I do not know why they have been arrested on the very day they were released on bail. The woman had been married before, and has now left her husband and gone with another man." Harish Choudhary, SHO of Khanpur, told TOI that the couple had not been traced. He said the two youth were now held in judicial custody, as the woman's husband had approached the court and named these two men in the case. "The two youth had been talking with the woman over the phone. We have strong reason to suspect that the two abetted the elopement. We are attempting to track down the couple and suspect these men could give us clues," Choudhary said. The families of the youth, however, say they had little to do with the couple besides being distantly related to the man.</text>

	<text>JAIPUR: Villagers of Jaleli Champawata in Jodhpur district found two deer dead on Saturday morning. One of the animals had bullet wounds. The tracks of the animals showed that they had run at least about four km despite the wounds. Ram Niwas, who leads a group called the Bishnoi Tiger Force, a group of youth from the Bishnoi community who volunteer to protect wildlife, said he received a call on his mobile phone from students headed to college in the morning. He said he reached the spot in half-an-hour despite being 50 km away, but was surprised to find that wildlife staff, located about 15 km of the spot, had not yet arrived. Ram Niwas said local wildlife authorities seemed unclear whether the matter should be taken up by officials attached to the wildlife wing in the area or territorial wildlife staff. The Bishnoi volunteers took the carcasses of the deer to the office of the district collector. District forest officer Mahender Singh said a post-mortem examination has been conducted, and the report is expected on Monday. Singh told TOI, "One of the animals was shot. There were no bullet wounds on the other one. The local Bishnois have been protecting the animals in the area for generations, so we now have good presence of wildlife here even in revenue and agricultural lands. The herbivore population has been rising as there are no predators. These deer fall under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, and killing them is punishable with seven years in jail."</text>

	<text>Alwar: Once scavengers, discrimination and humiliation is not new to these women. But what gives them a new lease of life is being accepted in the mainstream of the society and to be a part of a group along with Brahmins. For the erstwhile women scavengers of Alwar and Tonk, Thursday was something they did not expect in their lives. The group, along with Brahmin priests and Sanskrit scholars, took a holy dip in the Kshipra river at Ujjain during the ongoing Kumbh Mela.Thus, cleansing the dirt of untouchability from their minds. "Discrimination is not uncommon to us. There was a time when people would curse us and rush for a bath to cleanse themselves if they unknowingly happened to touch us.From those social practices by upper castes to this transformed mindset when two opposite sections taking a holy dip together is beyond imagination," said an enlightened Usha Tomar, a resident of Alwar. About 200 women who had earlier worked as manual scavengers took the holy dip along with widows from Vrindavan and the priests, amidst chanting of hymns and prayers. This was the first time that such an initiative had been pushed forward for promoting equality in society by erasing the barriers of caste and practices of untouchability.The idea was the brainchild of Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh Sanitation Movement, an NGO.</text>

	<text>Vadodara: Two dogs suffered burn injuries after an unidentified man hurled bottles of acid at them in Kalupura Brahman Faliya area of Fatehpura on Thursday morning. The incident took place when the dog catchers went to release the canines after vaccinating and sterilizing them. When the complainant Vinod Makwana approached the police to register FIR, the cops refused as he could not identify the attacker. The van and staff were from one of the organizations Hyderabad-based Vet Society for Animal Welfare and Rural Development (VSAWRD) that has been tasked with vaccinating and sterilizing the stray dogs by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). "After sterilization, the stray dogs are released at the same place from where they are caught. The man who was selling acid on his bicycle approached us and told us not to release the dog. When we retorted, he threw acid on us," said Makwana. There were four persons and seven dogs in the van. VMC officials said that the accused threw a bottle of acid on the staff. However, they managed to escape unhurt and got into the van. The man later followed them and hurled another bottle on the van. "Acid from the second bottle went through the grill and two dogs suffered injuries. After the police asked us to wait for a day to file an FIR, we gave a written application about the incident," said Dr Vijay Panchal, market superintendent from the health department of VMC. The programme is being conducted by city-based Vadodara Society for Prevention of cruelty to Animals (VSPCA) and VSAWRD in the city. The process was started after conducting a dog census in the city that revealed that there were an estimated 44,018 stray dogs.</text>

	<Heading>Great Indian tradition of debate alive and well: Wendy Doniger</Heading>

	<text>Indologist Wendy Doniger is the author of seminal books on Hinduism and mythology. She will be speaking at Times Lit Fest-Delhi this weekend. She tells Nalin Mehta that protests by writers can be effective, book bans don't work and that Hinduism's great tradition of debate is alive and well. Do you agree with the writers and film-makers who returned their awards to protest against rising intolerance in India? As someone whose book was withdrawn under a Congress government, do you think this is actually the case? Well, of course, my book was not banned, under any government; a lawsuit was brought by a group of private individuals against me and my publisher, and the publisher agreed to stop publishing the book in India. In fact, the book, the Hindus: An Alternative History, has now been republished by another publisher and is freely available. This seems to me to mean that protests really can be effective; the international protest against Penguin's action in withdrawing the book was inspiring, and ultimately bore fruit. So, too, I believe that the writers' and filmmakers' protests have rallied many of India's intellectuals to stand up against the rising intolerance of dissident views. Do book-bans ever work? I don't know if it's possible to generalize; some banned books may indeed have disappeared. But I can speak with confidence about my own case: the publicity generated by the attempt to keep it out of print made it a best seller, always available both in paper copies (in brown paper wrappers) and in (illegal) PDFs, and now again in a new paperback edition. Are Hinduism's traditions of samvaad under increasing threat? This is the real danger, I think. The open-mindedness and tolerance that has been the pride of India for centuries is seriously threatened by the legal actions and physical violence that have been directed against individuals whose words and actions were unacceptable to a narrow and narrow-minded band of Hindutva adherents. But recent developments give me new hope that the great Indian tradition of debate is alive and well. First the return of the awards by writers and film-makers, and now the emergence of a group of 46 scholars, Indian historians, who have announced their determination to engage in serious discussions about historiography with what they characterize as the "leftist" school of Indian history. I would love to be a part of such a serious discussion about genuine issues, a welcome change from the irresponsible and unscholarly attacks that those who oppose Hindutva historiography have been subjected to in the past. I see this as real progress toward a genuine intellectual encounter and I welcome it. Do you think the traditions of dissent and debate inherent within Hinduism are essentially inimical to Hindutva? I certainly do. Hindutva insists on a single, monolithic, unified Hinduism, and does not tolerate any vision or discussion of Hinduism that includes other aspects of the culture. There can therefore be no debate within Hindutva, since there is only one acceptable argument. Such a view by definition excludes most of Hinduism, including the interaction of contrasting views. An important example is the recent persecution of people-primarily but not only Muslims-who eat beef. The Hindutva assumption is that no Hindus eat beef, whereas in reality some Hindus do and other Hindus do not - the issue of beef, and cows, has a complex and tricky history in India. I was recently misquoted on this subject by a professor who claimed, on the basis of remarks that he says he overheard at an academic dinner party in my honor, that I believed that Partition might have been averted had Gandhi not been so reverent to cows. This is of course nonsense, and not what I was saying; the situation is far more complex than that. But Gandhi was indeed a supporter of the Cow Protection Society, despite rather than because of the anti-Muslim agendas that it had then and still has now. And those agendas contributed to the ultimate failure of his sincere efforts to work with Jinnah to integrate Muslims and Hindus and to avoid Partition. Complexities of this sort, which require an open mind and a sophisticated understanding of history, are simply ignored by advocates of Hindutva. The idea of samvaada is negotiation and nuance, which are destroyed by reductionist caricatures of anyone's views. Your latest book, 'The Mare's Trap' extols the Kamasutra as a landmark of Sanskrit secular literature. Why do you think so? The Kamasutra is certainly one of the earliest and most enduring Indian texts of a secular nature. Its scientific attitude to debate in general, and debate about the life of a cultivated urban-dweller in particular, is a model of scholarly writing. Argument is an intrinsic part of it; major points are debated, pro and con, until the author states what he thinks is the best view. The Kamasutra ignores caste entirely, and its attitude toward women is stunningly liberated, ignoring many of the more restrictive attitudes of traditional dharma. It is an amazingly modern book.</text>

	<text>Working professionals in India spend most of their time in a day sitting as against being active, revealed a report conducted by Max Bupa Walk for Health Survey 2016. The survey, the first of its kind study on walking behaviour, is based on data of over 1300 Indians across four cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Jaipur belonging to different backgrounds - working professionals, housewives, students and senior citizens. According to the study, 38 percent of the working population spends time sitting, while only 20 percent devote time to walking. Long working hours emerged as the biggest barrier to walking amongst professionals. The survey also revealed pollution as a key deterrent to walking with 16 percent Indians not taking a walk regularly due to rising pollution levels. "Max Bupa Walk for Health Survey 2016 has revealed an alarming reality that most of the working population in India spends 40 percent of its time in a day sitting. A simple yet effective way to improve one's health is a 30 minute daily walk," said Max Bupa Managing Director and CEO, Ashish Mehrotra. The survey showed that 8 percent suffered from blood pressure, back problems (15 percent), weak eyesight (14 percent) and overall weakness (12 percent) who do not walk regularly. Obesity emerged as the prime disease affecting housewives who do not walk (14 percent) while working women who do not walk suffer from weak eyesight (21 percent). However, 78 percent agree that walking helps to guard against lifestyle diseases. According to the findings, 44 percent of housewives started walking post getting diagnosed with diseases like blood pressure and sugar. "Max Bupa Walk for Health encourages people to take up walking for a healthier and a more successful life." added Anika Agarwal, head-marketing, Max Bupa. According to the survey, 74 percent Mumbaikars and 73 percent Delhiites prefer walking over other exercises, followed by Pune at 65 percent and Jaipur at 64 percent. While Delhi (47 percent), Mumbai (38 percent) and Jaipur (32 percent) walk for a good heart, Pune (38 percent) walks to lose weight.</text>

Fedora: Although this one reminds us of Indiana Jones, it's quite popular among women. It gives an edgy look to the feminine attire. Cloche: It was popular in the 1920s, but is now back in fashion. It's a classic accessory to go with a plain top and blue jeans. Pillbox: It is a perfect accessory to go with a semi-formal mid-length dress for an outdoor brunch party.</text>

	<text>Hot, sweaty and humid days can tend to drain the energy out of our body. It is evident that one cannot survive the summer without air coolers and air conditioners. Keeping your home cool, may help you, to an extent, to beat the heat. Here are a few tips to keep your house cool... - The problem area is the rooftop. It radiates heat and makes the entire house hot. Create a terrace garden to keep the rooftop cool. The soil will absorb the heat. If the rooftop is cool, the rooms will also be cool. If you plan to paint your house, paint the rooftop white, so that it reflects the heat. - Always ensure that you close your blinds during the daytime. Heat waves tend to enter your rooms through open windows. So, it is best to close them. If you really want to leave the windows open, then do so after the sunset. As for blinds, bamboo blinds are a good option to cool things down. - Flannel sheets and upholstery should be changed regularly during summer. Opt for soft cottons in pleasant colours so that the room remains cool during the day. - Switch off the home appliances after using them. The radiations that come out from these electronics can add to the heat in the room. Avoid using incandescent bulbs. - It is not just about keeping your house cool but you need to keep your body cool, too. Drink more liquids when you are at home. This is the time to indulge in those yummy milkshakes and smoothies. - Try to cross-ventilate the house as much as possible. Also, remember to leave the exhaust fans switched on during the day. - Do your kids stand near the refrigerator for cool air? Prevent them from doing so, as the effect is counterproductive. The motor in the fridge starts working harder when left open for a long time, thus making your room hotter. - This is the perfect time for grills. Chuck the stove and make ample use of the outdoors in the evenings. Call your friends over for a grill party. - Place a lot of flowers inside the house. This gives a pleasant atmosphere and is soothing. Also use this time to create a mini garden in the balcony, which not only looks pretty, but can cool down your room, too.</text>

	<text>Julia Roberts shocked everyone at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday when she walked the red carpet without any footwear. Dressed to kill in a vintage black gown, which she paired with an emerald and diamond neckpiece, her decision to not wear stilettos is now being considered as fashion rebellion. The move comes as a surprise as last year the festival's organisers had allegedly turned away a group of women from a film screening for wearing flat footwear. The festival follows a strict dress code wherein celebs are expected to wear high heels. The event, which was dubbed 'Heelgate', caused widespread outcry in fashion circles and received backlash from several celebrities. Celebs who decided to forgo their footwear on the red carpet: Cameron Diaz At the premiere of her film in 2003, the actress was the cynosure of all eyes as she walked down the red carpet minus shoes. She unwittingly upstaged her co-stars Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. Kristen Stewart The Twilight star has often been spotted switching her stilettos for sneakers. But on her recent red carpet stints, Kristen has ditched her heels and has no qualms going barefoot. Lena Dunham Whether it's the Met Gala or Emmy Awards after party, this actress-writer has proudly walked the red carpet without shoes, much to the surprise of onlookers and dismay of the fashion police! Shailene Woodley In 2014, The Fault In Our Stars actress, dressed in a low-cut gown for her film's premiere, not just gave her shoes a complete miss, she reportedly also walked all the way back to her hotel barefoot. Zooey Deschanel Though the actress wore strappy sandals to match her gown at an event in 2005, she eventually decided to choose comfort over style and took off her footwear as she posed for the shutterbugs.</text>

	<text>You'd think that in a city like Chennai, flowy dresses might be a strict no-no. Who's gonna deal with the heat and the accompanying complications of wearing a floorlength dress in exquisite fabrics? But the fashionistas of this city won't take things lying down. If there ever was an opportunity to make a style statement, they would be right at the forefront of it. And that's what we got to witness at a few formal and informal parties in Chennai where the ladies decided to go all haute-couture on us. Resort wear has now made its way into the city's party circuit as well, thanks to the drop in the temperature. Take for instance, how Aditi has added a touch of glam to her avatar by draping herself in a stunningly shaded resort dress. Incorporating a simple cut and wild colours, she paints a picture of elan. On the other side, you have Sofia, who has opted for golds and browns to keep her haute quotient on top of the ranks. The dress complements her mane perfectly and she beefs it up with matching shoes. You could try something on these lines as well. For those on the plus side, make sure you opt for garments that don't show off more than you really intend to. For those blessed with a great figure, go wild with your imagination.</text>

	<Heading>Bad habits that are preventing Indians from sleeping well</Heading>

	<text>It is incredible what a single night of blissful, uninterrupted sleep can earn you  a productive day at work, excellent (and faster) work-out results. If children get a good night's sleep every day, they are also likely to grow taller, say experts. However, an alarming increase in sleep disorders in India indicate that Indians are struggling to reap the benefits of a good night's sleep. "We seem to be content to sacrifice our sleep for success," says Dr Vikas Agrawal, senior ENT surgeon and sleep apnoea specialist, adding, "The problem is even more apparent in metropolitan cities where younger generations are working harder than ever to keep their heads afloat. Ten years ago, we didn't have as much work as we do now, and we did sleep better." But it's not the only reason behind the country's general state of sleeplessness. Here are six small, but vital things that are messing with our sleep, and why it's so important to ensure they're taken care of right away. Staying Up Late Many Indians end up compromising on the essential seven to eight hours of sleep (the optimum number of hours one needs to sleep for on an average) by simply staying up late, and then having to wake up early the next day. "This is especially noticeable on weekends, when one sleeps late and wakes up early on Monday, feeling tired even though there is an entire week of work stretching out in front of them," says senior neurologist and sleep specialist Dr Manvir Bhatia. "The best time to sleep is between 10 pm and 11 pm, judging, of course, on the time you wake up," says Alphonse Reddy, who founded India's first online sleep start-up. The company also conducted a survey recently, covering approximately 350 families in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru. It was found that Mumbai boasted of the most number of people who slept well after midnight. 32.72 per cent of Bengalureans sleep by 10 pm, compared to 10 per cent in Delhi and 12.8 per cent in Mumbai. It also said that Delhites lead the pack in this regard with a late night meal and a heavy one at that, which is directly related to a restless night, resulting in obesity and heart issues. Eating Late Lying down on a full stomach can put pressure on your heart and lungs, making it difficult to breathe, and causes fitful sleep. According to Dr P Vijaya Krishnan, the Maharajas of Rajasthan knew what they were doing by consuming their meals right before sunset (between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm). "Keep a gap of an hour-and-a-half between bedtime and your meals," he advises. Dr Bhatia agrees, revealing that most of her patients eat late because they work late and want to come home to a hot meal, instead of consuming it in the office. "As Indians, we cannot sacrifice the luxury of a meal eaten in the comfort of our home to signal that the day is finally over. To sleep well, one needs to unwind and release the day's tensions," she adds. Television, laptops, comfort foods and drinking are not the ideal way to relax or unwind from a hard day's work. People also end up giving to drowsiness after work or right after dinner, instead of waiting for bedtime  not a good plan, because you'll wake up later in the night and have trouble falling asleep. Exercising and reading books (print, not on your electronic gadgets) are sure-fire ways of unwinding, especially the former because it encourages the release of endorphins, or 'happy' hormones. Dr Bhatia also recommends deep breathing, meditation and Jacobson's relaxation techniques. "Simply lie down and close your eyes if you cannot sleep. The idea is to adopt a pattern that your body recognises so it will get accustomed to falling asleep," she says, "But none of this is possible if you insist on continue working once you are home or stressing yourself out." A Heavy Dinner "Not only do working people eat late, they also eat a heavy meal that can often be oily or hard to digest," says Dr Krishnan, "This can cause an acid reflux  the stomach releases more acid for digestion. Once you lie down, thanks to gravity, the sphincter muscle opens up, and allows acid to travel far more easily to your throat, inducing a burning sensation that will wake you up." Ruling out consuming any caffeine-based drinks before bed, he adds, "A lot of Indians also partake in smoking post a heavy meal. While smoking is bad in any form, it acts as a stimulant, further discouraging sleep, even though people believe it will help them sleep better after a meal." Consuming Vast Quantities Of Alcohol "I have observed that Indians tend to drink too much in the evenings," says Dr Bhatia. Ingesting vast quantities of alcohol can severely disrupt one's sleep, even though it may initially appear to help you pass out. "What's worse is that we tend to consume our drinks before our meals unlike our Western compatriots, who will eat their meal early and then head out for a drink," says Dr Bhatia, "Not only does one get drunk faster on an empty stomach, he/she delays the meal even further, and passes out immediately after." Drinking alcohol also increases your appetite, so the chances of eating heavy are high. "Once the alcohol levels in your body drop, you end up waking several times, spoiling any chances you had of getting a normal night's sleep," she says. Sleeping Next To Gadgets "The more the gadgets around you, the more the disturbances," says Dr Reddy. The survey showed that over 90 per cent of all bedrooms in metropolitan cities have a mobile phone. Self-luminous gadgets suppress melatonin, a natural hormone made by the pineal gland that induces sleep. "If this part of the circadian rhythm is constantly disrupted, it can lead to different disorders, including sleep apnoea, a common but deadly killer," says Dr Krishnan. Studies have shown that 30 to 40 per cent of the working population, particularly those in high-stress jobs such as corporate executives, medical professionals and cops, don't sleep well. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), characterised by respiratory difficulties during sleep, affects nine to 21 per cent of women and 24 to 31 per cent of men in the country. It has been linked to heart disease, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of cholesterol fat in blood) and insulin resistance.</text>

	<Heading>Is overstimulation leading to constant boredom?</Heading>

	<text>Believe it or not, new research has pointed out that the human attention span is now less than that of a goldfish, which is about eight seconds! Blame it on the overdose of the internet, social media, console games, online shopping, multi-channel TV, texting and whatnot, a normal person with sound mental and physical faculties now finds it difficult to hold a thought for a long time. This overstimulation is also partly the reason a considerable percentage of people today are 'chronically' bored, whether they are at home, in a classroom or at the workplace, despite having perpetual access to a plethora of high-intensity modes of entertainment at their fingertips. Most of us are so occupied with the screen-tapping schema all day long that regular activities such as commuting, reading reports, sitting in meetings, attending lectures or doing paperwork appear too mundane and slow-paced for our hardwired brains. And that's not all  chronic boredom may also lead to negative outcomes such as anti-social behaviour, overeating, gambling and drug use. "My job involves a lot of screen-time, meaning most of my working hours are spent tapping away at my keyboard. I also enjoy shopping online during my free time. Earlier, I could sit for hours reading a book, but now even flipping through the pages of a magazine puts me to sleep," says Preeti Maheshwari, an SEO executive at a city-based company. Giving an insight into the phenomenon, psychotherapist Tasneem Nakhoda says, "It's a rather strange observation that certain people do find themselves getting bored a lot faster, despite having so many sources at their disposal to keep themselves occupied." According to her, a number of factors could be fueling it  namely, a lack of inner peace; perhaps the individual is not getting enough of what actually appeals to his/her interest; and the constant feeling of having 'seen it all'. Too much dependence on various forms of online entertainment is also a major marker, the absence of which can create a void leading to boredom. Ways to alleviate the effects of tedium Try to avoid being too engrossed in your smartphone all the time Engage yourself in activities that involve your neural systems  such as cooking, painting, knitting or a sport Do your household chores Spend time with your pet (adopt a puppy or a kitten, if you don't have one yet) Try learning a new skill, maybe a hobby you managed to get time for earlier Concentrate on your current tasks</text>

	<text>At a time when Delhi is emerging not just a capital of politics but also as India's cultural capital, the countdown has begun for the city's biggest, first- of- its- kind, literature festival. The Times Lit Fest, Delhi which begins this Saturday (November 28) is presented by Rajnigandha. The festival will bring together authors and philosophers, politicians and poets, activists and scholars on one platform to exchange ideas and ideologies. The stellar line up this year includes globally celebrated authors and public intellectuals such as Amitav Ghosh, Niall Ferguson, Sunil Khilnani and Jagdish Bhagwati. "I am greatly looking forward to being at the Times Lit Fest. Delhi certainly deserves its own literature festival," says author Amitav Ghosh speaking to TOI. Ghosh returns to the city where he was a student and from where he began his literary journey. In keeping with the spirit of the times, Times Lit Fest-Delhi will encourage diverse viewpoints. While eminent economist Jagdish Bhagwati will reflect on his idea of the global economy, former minister Jairam Ramesh promises to offer an alternate viewpoint. While internationally renowned historian Niall Ferguson promises a global sweep of history and international diplomacy, the equally acclaimed author of 'The Idea Of India', Sunil Khilnani will showcase 50 Indians who have contributed to creating the ideas about India. Popular best- selling authors like Amish will offer glimpses into how younger Indians identify with mythology and legend. In a year when political books made headlines,leading journalists will offer their perspectives on elections in India from general elections to assembly elections in Bihar. There will also be a strong representation of regional writers and poets reflecting the richly plural cultural heritage of India's capital. In the city of politics, the present finance minister Arun Jaitley and his immediate predecessor P. Chidambaram will explore ideas of the law, jurisprudence and democracy. At a time when dissent has led to a passionate national debate on tolerance, writers Taslima Nasrin and historian Wendy Doniger will offer contrasting perspectives. From a presentation on Sachin Tendulkar biography to airplane poetry, from spiritual teacher Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev's evocations of the divine to Kiran Nagarkar's illuminations on the historical novel, Times Lit Fest-Delhi will showcase a gamut of cultural expressions and be a truly people's festival. Set amidst the nostalgic colonial architecture of the Maidens hotel, the Fest's aim is to bridge the gap between the old and the new Delhi, between high culture and the aam admi. Times Lit Fest-Delhi promises to be a trend setter by redefining the idea of Delhi and of literature festivals.</text>

	<text>South Africa commemorated World Malaria Day on Monday, pledging to eliminate the disease by 2018. The country is set to raise awareness about malaria prevention and to focus on the achievements, progress and challenges in the fight against malaria, the health department said. It has embarked on awareness and educational campaigns that include radio campaigns, community events, door-to-door campaigns and distribution of pamphlets at shopping centres before and during World Malaria day, Xinhua news agency reported. South Africa plans to eliminate malaria by achieving an incidence of zero cases of locally transmitted malaria by 2018. South Africa registered 11,700 cases of the disease in 2014, down from 64,000 in 2000 with most cases coming from areas bordering Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In a report marking World Malaria Day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that through targeted action and cross-border collaboration, South Africa has the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. WHO estimates that 21 countries are in a position to achieve this goal, including six countries in the African region, where the burden of the disease is the heaviest. These countries are Algeria, Botswana, Cape Verde, Comoros, South Africa and Swaziland.</text>

	<text>An online nail-art technique that gives one's talons a razor-like finish is going viral. It's an off-shoot of the edge-nails trend. It's a technique in which one's nails are made to look like prisms. For this form of nail art, manicurists use opalescent gel or acrylic powder to create an angled shape. This results in crystal-like nails, which glint as the faceted surfaces hit the light.</text>

	<text>People in India and Ukraine spend just over 13 hours a week cooking, compared to the international average of less than six and a half hours each week, a recent study revealed. They are followed by South Africa, where its citizens, on an average spend nine and a half hours on culinary activities, Indonesia where people spend more than eight hours a week and Italy seven hours a week. The research, conducted by Germany-based market researcher GfK, said the countries where people spent the least amount of time cooking each week were Brazil (slightly more than five hours), Turkey (slightly less than five hours) and South Korea (less than four hours), possibly due to the popularity of their inexpensive street food carts. The research was conducted by interviewing over 27,000 people aged 15 and above in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine and the US. The study further said globally 29 percent of people claim to have great knowledge and experience about food and cooking -- but this was again led by women at 34 percent, compared to just a quarter (25 percent) of men. "Breaking this down into individual countries, South Africa and India top the list, with around half of people (50 and 48 percent, respectively) agreeing, or agreeing strongly, that this applies to them. "Also in the top five are Turkey and Ukraine at 40 percent each and Indonesia at 38 percent," the study said. It further revealed that women spend over seven and a half hours per week for preparing the dishes while men spend five hours a week.</text>

	<text>Q. Your first memory of cricket? My first cricket bat that I bought at the age of six, for `250. I played with that bat for five years. I still have it with me as my fondest cricket memory. Q. That moment when you thought you could be playing for India... Ever since I played at my complex in Dombivli, I dreamt of playing for India. Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid have been my role models since my childhood. I got selected to play for Under-14, Under-16 and Under-17 teams, and that took me closer to this dream. When I got selected for India Under-19 team, I started to believe I will play for the Indian national team too. Q.Which teams do you play for? Team India, Mumbai in Ranji Trophy, and Rising Pune Supergiants in IPL. Q. What was the lowest moment in your life and how did you come out of it? There are no lows, only challenges. I would wake up at 4 am to catch a 5 am train from Dombivli to CST. I walked from CST to maidan, practised and then played a match. I would walk back to CST to catch a train to Dombivli. I would travel four hours daily from the age of 8, till I was 21. Even when I got selected for the Mumbai Ranji team, I used to travel by train for first two years. At 22, I bought my first second-hand car. It was financially and physically difficult to manage this daily travel but I used to have fun - and this daily effort kept motivating me to do better. Q. You've toiled hard to get to where you are. Did your struggle at any point of time become overwhelming? Was your goal always in sight? I never thought of my life goals while catching the daily train. I only thought of the task at hand. And at that time, it was to catch the train on time. While travelling in the train, I thought of doing well at practice or the match on that day. I wanted to be consistent and do well at each task rather than be lost in long-term goals. I only thought of making myself important for the team on that particular day. After a match, I had to think of reaching home on time to study. After that I had to get free on time for my judo class in the evening. I guess, focusing on these daily smaller goals eventually helped me achieve my real goal. Q. How do you de-stress or prepare yourself for high-pressure games? I listen to music in my room. I read autobiographies of my icons. Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Andre Agassi and Yuvraj Singh's autobiographies are my favourites. I also watch a lot of movies - Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander being my all-time favourite. I have been an Aamir Khan fan since that movie. Q. How do you mentally prepare yourself for the day ahead? I start my day by meditating for 15 minutes. I take slow, deep breaths and think about the day ahead and how to deliver under pressure. Q. Which sport helps you stay fit for cricket? Tennis is one of my favourites. Roger Federer is my icon. I always find time to play tennis. I am also a Black Belt in judo. Q. Amidst this busy schedule, where and how did you find your soulmate? My wife and I used to live in the same complex. We were dating each other for seven years before we got married. Q. How do you make sure on-field tension does not affect your personal life? After every match or practice session, I give myself 15 minutes to reflect on my performance, and then switch off. Whenever I go out for dinner or a movie, or if I'm with my wife, I never discuss cricket. It keeps my mind fresh. Q. What is your relationship advice to people in high-stress jobs? Keep things really simple. Respect your partner, devote time to think about him/her and show that you have respect for each other. Most importantly, stay humble and stay on the same page. Q. How is it being a cricketer in India, where fans want every detail about your life? We are what we are because of our fans. We give our best to get their love and respect. So when they actually shower their admiration, we need to respect it. We just need to focus on things in our hands and everything else follows. Q. Future goals? To remain passionate and always be eager to learn a lesson from any situation. Quick fire Fave outfit: Tees and denims Fave perfume: Tom Ford Style icon: Aamir Khan. Favourite cuisine: Japanese, especially, sushi Do you cook? No. Favourite travel destination? Switzerland - the scenery is calming. Travel tip: Don't think, just travel... There's lots to see and learn.</text>

	<text>Celebrity chef Vikas Khanna talks about cooking for world leaders, his new recipe book and signing off in 2020 What do you tell a chef like Vikas Khanna, who's ticked off so many boxes? A Michelin star? Check. He has one for the New York restaurant, Junoon, of which he's now culinary ambassador. A best-selling author? Check. He's been churning out books with much alacrity -the most recent being Indian Harvest: Classic and Contemporary Vegetarian Dishes. A TV personality? Been there, done that. He's the host of Masterchef India, Junior Masterchef India and Twist of Taste -all of which trade on his boyish features, his kitchen prowess and his relatable personality.Philanthropist? Well, he has his own foundation, SAKIV (South Asian Kids Infinite Vision) and he's been associated with the Smile Foundation in India for over 3 years. Oh, and he hobnobs with the Dalai Lama. Khanna was in the city last week for a charity cook-off hosted by the Grand Hyatt and the Smile Foundation. After spending an afternoon judging dishes created by personalities such as Anjolie Ela Menon, Nachiket Barve and Manasi Scott, we finally manage to have a chat with the celebrity chef. Khanna's clientele includes world leaders like President Obama and Bill Clinton. He has also, most recently, cooked for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Yet, his fondest memories of food come from Amritsar, where he spent many hours cooking with his grandmoth er. During the interview, Khanna switches between Hindi and English, with a Punjabi accent, and pulls off a wickedly good imitation of how Americans speak. As he digs into a bowl of salad (arugula, pomegranate seeds, barley, parmesan shavings and feta, if you must know), our conversation veers towards the supremacy that the West places on creativity and innovation. We prod him about his famous clients and Khanna explains that there is a `protocol to be followed' while serving them. "Someone may be lactose intolerant but can have yoghurt, while someone else may be allergic to cumin. Their secretaries call my secretary to let me know their exact requirements," he explains. Planning the menu is a tough task, he admits, but one that he embraces. "Every day, you represent your motherland. Every dish you make and every word you speak is an opportunity to represent India," he says. Cooking Indian food abroad was a learning curve, says the chef, as contrary to galas abroad, the ones in India usually serve world cuisine."It just makes us seem more welltravelled to our guests. But that perception is slowing changing." We talk about Utsav, his new recipe book which celebrates festivals and the foods associated with them, from around the world. "The book gives equal space to festivals like Diwali and Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year)," he smiles. The print run of the book is currently restricted to 12 copies and each copy is "engraved, hand bound and hand cut," he says, calling it a "labour of love". One copy will be auctioned off, with proceeds going to the Smile Foundation.Khanna calls the book a "once in a lifetime passion project".Explaining the auction and the book's limited copies, he says, "I hope the book will set a benchmark as the most expensive book in the world. I want to prove that you can make a mark with Indian cuisine, be it through cookbooks, dinners or TV." The book also features poetry by Khanna and covers regional celebrations like the Hornbill festival, held annually in Nagaland. A serendipitous meeting with a professor at Harvard, where Khanna had enrolled for a course in 2005, was the genesis of the book and most of his achievements, says Khanna. During the meeting, the professor opined that Indians weren't big spenders and that Khanna should go after a more "elevated market" which, according to him, included South America, Latin America, Persia, Spain and the Middle East. To prove his professor wrong, he worked hard to redefine Indian dining, says the chef, citing the example of the $39,000-a-plate dinner he hosted a couple of years ago. Did he ever predict such success for himself? Khanna looks incredulous. "Arey, pagal toh nahi hai tu?" he grins. Talking about future plans, Khanna admits to studying food trends that might come in handy in 2017-2018. He wants to decide the topic of his next book -grains, for instance he says, have been attracting a lot of interest."I'm only cooking till 2020. And then I'm just going to run my foundation, SAKIV," he smiles. - Aatish Nath</text>

	<text>Writer Kirthi Jayakumar was listening to a rather tiring lecture in law school, when she spaced out and began to scribble in her notebook and before she knew it, she had filled the whole page with designs. Soon, she found this doing at different points of time -sometimes at workshops, or sometimes when she was in a queue somewhere, waiting for the line to move, or waiting for someone at a cafe. It was a friend and former colleague Vaidehi Mehta, who put a name to it, and called it zen doodling. "I had no idea it existed, even, and when I looked it up online, I was pleasantly surprised to see a whole world of people who were doing this." WHAT IS ZEN DOODLING? Zen doodling seems to be the buzzword in the city of late, with an increasing number of people indulging their artistic side by doodling, and coming up with beautiful designs. And the trend seems to be only picking up, Amritha Venketakrishnan, who owns an art supply store in the city says, that like adult colouring books, doodle pads and specific brands of pens that are used to doodle, are flying off the shelves these days. "In addition to zen titles in colouring books, we also sell smaller zentangle sketch books, which are pocket-sized and manufactured by us. We began manufacturing our own line of books as other brands don't make less expensive options, in the A6 size. We use a 210gsm paper, which is pretty thick. The trend, in my opinion, goes hand-in-hand with the colouring trend, and the two just feed off each other, mostly ," she says. LEARNING TO ZEN DOODLE While Kirthi has always remained an instinctive doodler, Deepika Ramesh, a BPO employee, who, inspired by Kirthi's work, began doodling recently, says, "The most beautiful aspect of Zen doodling is that one doesn't have to `learn'. Perhaps, I that one doesn't have to `lear enjoy it more because I have the liberty to create and practise my own patterns. They can be random. However, I did watch a couple of videos on YouTube. Zen doodling is not as orthodox as some other forms of Zen art, which is quite interesting." Patterns that doodlers normally use are waves, stars, circles, dots, scales... but most doodlers say that they prefer going with the flow.Kirthi says, "Sometimes, I let it flow. Sometimes, my mind chooses an idea. For example, when Aylan Kurdi passed away, or when the Peshawar school attack killed so many innocent children, or when a violation of rights occurs, I tend to respond to it by drawing something that sits well with the emotional response to the issue. So I just let it flow --it doesn't always make sense, for example, an architecturally sound monument with flowers on its body -but that's an emotion, so I let it be." WHEN DOODLES HEAL That is not all, studies have proven that Zen doodling, which involves filling up a design with patterns of the doodler's choice, has therapeutic effects too -it is known to relax the mind and even help those battling anxiety and depression to calm down. Deepika talks about how zen doodling has benefited her immensely. "One year before I started practising Zen doodling, I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder.That's when friends began recommending adult colour ing books to cope with anxiety and overthinking. Since I am a temperamental Zen doodler, sometimes I doodle for hours, and sometimes I go without doodling for a week. But I firmly believe that Zen doodling helps me stay in the present. When I concentrate on the patterns and my drawing, naturally, I don't think about my past and future. That moment, when the pen touches the paper, it feels as though time agrees to be kind to me. The mere process is absolutely cathartic. And like every other piece of art, the doodle reflects the of art, the doodle reflects the mood of the creator. Zen doo dling is an amazing non-ver bal journal and every doodle is a strong statement." Magdalene Jeyarathnam, director of the East West Center for Counselling &amp; training, an Expressive Arts Therapy Center at Women's Christian College, which offers art therapy courses says, "Zen doodling is not one of the expressive arts thera peutic approaches. Having said that, any form of art, and in particular arts like Zen doodling, Zen tangle, man dala colouring helps in bring ing focus and helps both chil dren and adults who struggle with attention deficit disor ders." ZENTANGLE VS ZEN DOODLE Going hand in hand with Zen doodling is Zentangle, which follows a similar style as Zen doodling. Yet, there are minor differences. Sandhya Manne, a certified zentangle teacher says, "Zentangle is an act of creating abstract art by being mindful of every line and every stroke, unlike doo dling which is often a sub conscious act that hap pens while having a con versation over the phone or on in lecture. As a teacher, I teach Zentangle in an easy to understand method using a structured for mat." Sandhya, who was first introduced to the concept when she was living in the US, came back to India in 2013 and began to educate people about Zentangle and its methods. "One of the reasons it is popular is because unlike other art mediums Zentangle is easy to learn and implement and requires very little tools and supplies. I am always impressed by the wonderful works of my students, particularly the ones created by those who walk into my beginner class saying they "cannot draw"," she adds.The benefits of Zentagle, however, cannot be discounted. Sandhya adds that the process has brought out the Zen in her. "I used to be anxious and quite stiff with my thoughts and ideas. Zentangle has taught me to let go and be more open to what the universe has to offer. I have also become more patient towards the final outcome and do not get critical midway about events. My students too, tell me that they now sleep better or that Zentangle has helped with regularising their blood pressure." Restaurateur Mathangi Kumar concurs. "There is a kind of structured perfection in Zentangle that you don't see in regular doodling. It is said that Zentangle is about the process and not the outcome. It is very soothing, and for me personally, it is a great stress buster. It helps to unwind after a long day at work and the results are always pretty."</text>

	<text>The state boasts of rich culture and tradition, with a number of pristine locations which are a major tourist attraction. From beaches to caves the list ceases to end. The Sahayadris are bestowed with stone-cut caves that have intricate and miniature carvings covering the walls. The mysterious Ajanta and Ellora caves in Aurangabad were a chance discovery by a British official while he was out hunting. The caves are now being restored to safeguard the paintings and artwork etched on them. The Ajanta caves are a trail of 30 odd caves with intriguing folklore. Most of them have revered deities and also antiqueware kept on display. Hill stations A quick getaway to hill stations from the scorching heat and the city's maddening traffic seems to be an ideal option for most Mumbaikars. From Khandala, Matheran to Panchgani, these elevated locations are the best way to cool you off. This also is a great option for quick escape from the monotony of work. Mumbaikars usually drive down to these places to enjoy weekends and it's also serves like a getaway. Beaches The coastal belt is quite rich when it comes to its culture and food. It's an ideal route for a bike ride and apt for drives too. Water sports like snorkelling, scuba diving and the likes are common in these areas. It's not only the picturesque beauty that draws people to visit the beaches but also the comfort it has to offer. Some places like Alibaug, Tarkali and Ganpatipule are popular destinations that can be explored. Forts Maharashtra owes it to the royal family for its forts. It was in their reign that so many forts were built in the state which are now of historic relevance. Historians have stories to tell and tourists find it interesting to look around and satisfy their inquisitive minds with information about the Maratha rulers. The forts which are spread across the state are not just on the hills but surrounded by the sea as well.</text>

	<text>Four types of relationship patterns that indicate whether a couple is likely to stay together have been identified in a new study. The research, conducted by Brian Ogolsky of the University of Illinois, classified couples by the changes in their commitment to get married and the reasons for these changes. Ogolsky studied 376 unmarried couples in their mid-20s over the course of nine months. He identified four different relationship types: dramatic, conflict-ridden, socially involved and partner-focused. The dramatic group made up 34% of the couples who were more turbulent and spent less time together. The conflict-ridden formed 12%of the couples. They were the ones classified as having the most arguments, but the relationship was still sturdier than the dramatic couples. The third group, which accounted for 19% of couples, was the socially involved  heavily influenced by interactions with social networks. Partner-focused couples valued their partner above other aspects of life, but this could change depending on the amount of time spent together. These made up 30% of the group. The study also found that these "types also differed on important relational variables, including satisfaction, love, ambivalence, worries about marriage and leisure". The study found that, after the nine-month period, couples in the dramatic group, were most likely to break up. Those in the socially-involved group were said to be the most influenced by "interactions" on social networks, but their commitment to marriage varied the least. Those in the partner-focused group showed high levels of positive interaction and were deemed to have the highest chance of staying together and getting married.</text>

	<text>Glycemic index (GI) is a scale, which helps in ranking the carbohydrate rich foods, depending on how they affect blood glucose levels in a span of 2 - 3 hours after having food. The glycemic index of a carbohydrate-containing food is a ranking of how much it raises blood glucose level compared to pure glucose, which is assigned a glycemic index value of 100. The food having a higher GI breaks down quickly and shoots up your blood sugar levels rapidly. While the food having a lower GI takes a longer time to get digested and absorbed, resulting in slower and gradual changes in blood sugar levels. To determine a food's glycemic index value, researchers give 10 or more volunteers a portion of the food being tested that contains 50 grams of carbohydrate. The volunteers' blood glucose levels are checked before they eat the food and periodically during the two hours after they eat it. On another occasion, those same volunteers consume a portion of glucose (or sometimes white bread is used) that contains 50 grams of carbohydrate, and the same blood glucose measurements are taken. The two sets of measurements are then compared. Ten or more volunteers are used in these tests, and their results are averaged, because each person responds to food slightly differently. Not only does the glycemic index of a food vary slightly from person to person, but it also depends on whether the food is eaten in isolation or with other foods. Consuming a food along with protein, fat, or other carbohydrates that have a lower glycemic index effectively lowers its glycemic index value. Other things that can affect a food's glycemic index value include the ripeness of fruits (under-ripe fruits have a lower glycemic index than ripe fruit) and how foods are cooked or otherwise processed. A glycemic index value of 70 or higher is considered high, 56-69 is considered medium, and 55 or lower is considered low. A diet with low to medium glycemic index foods along with healthy protein is beneficial in diabetes. A helpful tip: Do not worry, there a simple way to get the Glycemic Index of commonly used foods Various web-based applications and GI calculators are available.

	<text>What started as International Workers' Day in Chicago in May 1886 further spread to other parts of the world, India being no exception. The first celebration of Labour Day in India took place in Chennai on May 1, 1923. Organised by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan, the red flag, an emblem of the labour class, was also used in India. The party's leader, Singaravelu Chettiar, conducted 'May Day' celebrations in two places  one at a beach opposite Madras High court and the other at the Triplicane beach. He later presided over the meeting and a resolution declaring a holiday on the occasion was passed here. Certain other pointers explaining non-violent principles of the party, request for some financial aid and achieving independence for the workers of the world were discussed, too. A nationwide public holiday, it highlights the labour movements for communist and socialist political parties. Known by various names like Kamgar Din (Hindi), Kamgar Divas (Marathi) and Uzhaipalar Dinam (Tamil), the 'Antarrashtriya Shramik Diwas'. Russia Until the official declaration in 1917, Russians celebrated the day illegally. Post this year, these celebrations were boycotted by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, anarchists and Mensheviks. It went on to become a significant official holiday of the Soviet Union, which they celebrated with parades in major cities. Since 1992, it is officially termed as 'The Day of Spring and Labour' and is a major holiday. Japan In Japan, while there's no officially designated holiday on the day, most people take their day off since it falls between other national holidays. Starting from April 29, the 'Golden Week' begins. This day is celebrated as Showa Day, the birthday of Emperor Showa, who reigned between 1926 and 1989. May 3, 4 and 5 are celebrated as Constitution Memorial Day, Greenery Day and Children's Day, respectively. In New Zealand and some parts of Australia, this day is celebrated on the first Monday of October, while in US and Canada, it takes place on the first Monday of September Every year, a theme is planned by the members of the International Labour Day, this year being 'Celebrating the international labour movement'. This theme becomes the centre point of the celebrations and activities like crossword puzzle, anagram puzzle, word search puzzle, code cracker puzzle, word scramble puzzle take place.</text>

	<text>A class of drug that inhibits production of the primary female sex hormone, estrogen , and is used to treat breast cancer has been found to quickly and effectively suppress dangerous brain seizures, a study says. "The effect was profound and very clear," said Catherine Woolley, senior author of the study from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The research was conducted in a rat model of status epilepticus, a condition characterized by a prolonged episode of seizure activity. "This shows that clinically available drugs could be effective therapies for suppressing seizures in humans," Woolley noted. The researchers also discovered, to their surprise, that seizures stimulate the production of estrogens in the brain of both males and females and that this plays a previously unknown role in the escalation of seizure activity. Estrogen synthesis during a seizure makes it worse, the study found. The findings suggest a new approach to treating seizures in humans -- shut down the brain's production of estrogen when a seizure first begins. Current seizure treatments are not targeted. They work by dampening neural activity generally and come with many side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness or difficulty concentrating. In the study published in the journal eLife, the researchers found that inhibiting estrogen synthesis just after seizure onset strongly suppressed seizures in both sexes, without anti-seizure drugs or other interventions. The scientists injected male and female animals with either an inert substance or an aromatase inhibitor, either letrozole or fadrozole, just after the start of a chemically induced seizure. They studied the animals for up to six hours and found both fadrozole and letrozole strongly suppressed seizures in both sexes.</text>

Whether it's the music played in the nightclubs or even the fashion statements made by the young and restless of the city. Women, as always seemed to leading the way with respect to the style quotient. And nowhere was this more prominent than at a recent do where a gang of girls walked in, dressed in what could only be termed as a floral bounty. Take the case of Isabelle and Arnelle. The duo have given a spin to the concept by wearing their outfits in two completely contrasting ways. You could try the same or some new combos. Add some beaded accessories, chunky jewellery and you're ready to give retro a new twist.</text>

	<text>The BJP government has begun work on a major overhaul of the Medical Council of India as it looks to create more medical colleges and produce more doctors to cater to growing healthcare needs. Sources said during a review meeting of the health sector, PM Narendra Modi and the health ministry had also discussed the option of scrapping the country's apex medical education regulator, which has been shrouded in controversy in recent years. Although sources ruled out such a drastic measure, the government has set up a three-member panel to prepare a blueprint to revamp the current set-up. The highpowered committee has Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya, the PM's additional principal secretary P K Mishra and Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant as members.Sources said that at the meeting it was pointed out that the MCI is one of the major stumbling blocks towards a faster expansion, especi ally when it comes to ensuring quality education. The development came after the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare too had called for a complete overhaul of the medical council as it has repeatedly failed in its mandate as a regulator of medical education and profession. In its report before Parliament last month, the panel had recommended that the Act under which the council was established be scrapped and new legislation be brought in Parliament "at the earliest". Sources said that at the PM's meeting, the need for major focus on increasing the availability of doctors and paramedical staff, especially in poor-performing sta es such as Bihar, UP , Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, was emphasised. At the same time, the government is acutely aware that drastic action through legislative amendments may not be easy given hat changes must be ushered in via he legislative route and the government does not enjoy majority in Rajya Sabha. In recent years, MCI has been involved in controversies, the panel pointed out and it was shocked to know that compromised individuals had made it to the medical council, but the health and family welfare ministry is not empowered to act. It noted that the MCI chief admitted o "corruption when there was sanctioning of medical colleges, or increasing or decreasing seats" and "private medical colleges arrange ghost faculty and patients during inspections by MCI and no action is taken for the irregularity".</text>

	<text>The holiday season is long gone and you've probably started to regret the food comas and binge drinking, and have pledged to get to the gym. But with orthoexia nervosa - the obsession with healthy eating and fitness - hitting headlines, how can you adopt a truly healthy lifestyle without becoming obsessed? In the last four months of 2015, I tried to find out with the help of a fitness expert and celebrity personal trainer who revealed the most important ways to find the right balance for your body. I learned that the key to a healthy lifestyle is staying motivated without getting hooked on fitness routines and strict diets. London-based personal trainer and founder of the Be The Fittest service, Tyrone Brennand, warns me against the risks of falling for so-called "Hollywood health trends" and desiring to copy unrealistic bodies seen on magazines and social media. "Becoming too obsessed with training and dieting can become detrimental for your health. I mean, it's important to remember that we all should exercise regularly and eat healthy to have a fit, healthy body and mind, to also feel good, but once we start becoming obsessed this can be a trigger to an adverse effect," he says. He explains that getting hooked on being healthy might trigger addiction to performance enhancing supplements, hormones, unhealthy diets and cause eating disorders. The routines and diets you see online and on magazines might simply not be for you. During my training sessions with Brennant, I begin to understand that it's all about finding the right balance, resting and recovering, and "listening to your body". "Everyone has a routine that will suit them best but I think the right way of doing it is all about balance," he explains. "There are different sessions, intensities and volumes." But on top of not abusing your body with workouts, it is important to stay balanced with what you eat. "I think many people follow certain diets trying to achieve certain results but they do not know what their body needs or lacks and how it reacts to specific foods," he says. "Make sure your diet is clean, balanced and healthy by avoiding processed foods. It's all about eating what your body requires day to day and understanding how your body reacts to certain foods. You can treat yourself sometimes, too. So eat the healthier types of foods in restaurants. Also eat in moderation - don't over fill yourself. "Try and add good fruits and vegetables into your diet, making sure your diet is balanced so also having fibre and giving your body all the nutrients it needs. So, combining exercises with a good diet is the formula for fitness - but what's the best way of getting back to training in the New Year? "Listen to your body if you need a rest, and so rest your body. You are the best person who understands your body and what it needs," says Brennant. "I think training from three to five days a week is enough to keep a healthy lifestyle. Whether you exercise for 20 minutes or an hour. If someone does train up to five days a week or more they must remember to keep it balanced with the type of training, volume and intensity to keep from over reaching and being at risk of injury." He also recommends practising yoga inbetween training sessions. "The gains and feeling I have got from yoga have been unbelievable, and have also helped me improve my other aspects of training." All this sounds good in writing, of course, but putting it into pratice can be a bit challenging at the beginning, so if you're sweating already at the idea, I hear you. But, once you get the flow and realise what you can achieve, you will feel stronger, healthier and balanced: you will feel good. And that's where personal training comes into action: with motivation and guidance while you're exercising. "Energy", "no pain, no gain"... you've heard them all, but it really means something when you're breaking the sweat, your heart is beating so fast that you feel you're about to faint and you can barely catch your breath. Brennant motivated me with these words during his hour-long sessions - despite the phrases sounding cliched, they kept me going strong. He just wouldn't let me slack off. But every drop sweat was worth it. I challenged myself in different routines, from circuits to boxing. In four months of training I realised I was capable of doing so much more than I thought. It's all about that feeling rather than trying to copy unrealistic, ripped bodies. So, now we're all motivated, right. It's January after all. "New year, new you..." But how to keep yourself motivated thoughout the year? "Instead of just trying to get fit for January, try and set yourself a two or three month goal at first," Brenant advises. "Then set small target markers to reach and aim for per month or fought night, so you can see progression and keep on track but still have an end goal to aim for. "Once you have reached the three month period and successfully completed that challenge then set anothertwo or three month goal and follow same process. If you fail within this time then perhaps set smaller marker goals like every week for a month or so."</text>

	<text>Title: Real Resonance, the Unreal Mind Author: Chandra Shekhar Dubey Publisher: Shambhai, The Third Eye Imprint Price: INR 150 Dr Chandra Shekhar Dubey's "Real Resonance, the Unreal Mind" is a collection of poems woven around life's miscellaneous nuances, ranging from love, spirituality, gender issues, social causes and nature. Dr Dubey who is an Associate Professor of English Literature at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College is a master of abstract and romanticism and reminds you of John Donne and P.B Shelley when you go through his collection of poems. But you can't allocate a particular style to the author as he follows a new one in every poem. This beautiful technique of surprising the reader continues in all his works. If Dr Dubey's earlier poetic works, "Ripples on a stone" and "Substance of Shadows" explored the mysterious world of human psyche with their profound analysis of abstract, polysemous sentiments, Real Resonance is experience and sensibility amalgamated into a harmonious blend, shaped into esthetic, pulchritudinous verses. The verses give away a poet who is an adroit scholar and knows the Roman mythology, the English countryside and the British mannerisms like the back of his hand and yet, he infuses them all with a deep, tender Indian spirit. Time fritters with silent footfalls...the author's imagery is superb and he is is able to invoke a different image in all his poems. Dr Dubey's romanticism is almost infectious. The compelling emotion of his poems, force you out of the tedious hustle and bustle of your own life and lead you to a tranquil world where feelings, emotions and inspirations, still make a difference. "Real Resonance, The Unreal Mind" is truly the resonance of a mind that's supremely unusual in the way it looks at life and churns various realizations and experiences into a dazzling string of words, lending posterity to life's unforgettable moments in the annals of time.</text>

	<text>We all love wearing gold, but here are some lesser known facts about the shiny metal that seems almost indispensable when you're decking up. The olympic gold medal isn't made of gold The Olympic gold medal consists of around 1% gold. The rest of it roughly comprises 92% silver and 6% copper. The last time solid gold medals were handed out at the Olympics was 1912. Cell phones have gold in them If you collect 900 kilos of cell phones, you'll be able to collect more gold from that than you'd be able to extract from gold ore of the same weight. Can't wait around to collect that many cell phones? It turns out that if you collected all the gold that is in the ocean, there'd be enough for every person in the world to have four kilos of it! It's edible Gold is 'biologically inert', which means that it can pass through your digestive tract without getting absorbed into your system. Even so, most experts recommend that you don't gulp down the first necklace you see if you have the munchies! Aurophobia It might be hard for most to relate to, but some people suffer from the irrational and extreme fear of gold, or sometimes even golden objects - a condition called aurophobia. The very sight or mention of gold can cause nausea, dizziness and panic attacks, among other symptoms. A gold bar atm? Forget heading to the ATM for cash - a hotel in Dubai has an ATM that hands out gold bars weighing 10 grams. It even gives personalised gold coins. An eerie reason behind gold earrings Sailors in Europe used to wear gold earrings - not for fashion, but in the event that they drowned and their bodies washed up, the gold could be used as payment to give them a proper Christian burial.</text>

	<text>After a tough workout session, muscle soreness often sets in. But when your training escalates to the point that you're having a bromance with good old DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), you may need to find some alternative reliefand, you know, dial your workouts back a bit! Restrictive clothing It may sound a tad bit fantastic and even looney, but workout recovery can be aided by clothing that corrects your posture. So, shirts and shorts, which have built-in elasticised bands can subtly coax the body into better postural alignment. These bands target specific muscle groups and connect one to another. This way, muscles which are underused in areas like the chest and the back, are simulated. According to physical fitness enthusiasts, the body feels best when the joints are in neutral alignment which is the foundation of physical therapy and recovery. The back, which is one of the main muscle groups that gets stressed during a workout needs to be aligned to heal correctly. Experts say that it is not about compressing or restricting the muscles but encouraging them to heal in a healthier and more natural movement pattern. Cyrotherapy In cyrotherapy, you spend two to three minutes with your body enclosed in a chamber that circulates extremely chilled air. It works on the principle that when exposed to severe cold, the body sends the blood to the core to protect vital organs. Once back to normal temperature, the body immediately rushes the blood to peripheral tissues. This way, blood flow is improved considerably which results in reduced inflammation, pain and an increased metabolic rate including an endorphin rush. Proteins Amino acids are the building blocks of tissue, and we consume protein to give our bodies enough to rebuild and maintain muscles damaged during workouts. Having a little protein before working out can trigger our bodies to start muscle synthesis (repairing and building more muscle) throughout and even after hitting the weights. While a protein-rich snack can get the body ready for a great workout, sipping on a protein smoothie or eating a protein-filled meal can ensure the body has enough fuel to keep on rebuilding throughout the day. Also, Consuming a light, protein-rich snack before bed allows our bodies to keep repairing muscles overnight.</text>

	<Heading>Advances in medical care linked to Type-1 diabetes boom</Heading>

	<text>Although it may sound counterintuitive, researchers from the University of Adelaide say that the global increase in Type-1 diabetes is directly linked to advances in medical care that has significantly increased the life expectancy of people. For the study, the researchers looked at the prevalence of Type-1 diabetes in 118 countries and changes in life expectancy from 1950 to 2010. After applying a measure known as the Biological State Index to the data, they found that the rapid increase in Type-1 diabetes over the last few decades was directly linked with increases in human life expectancy, especially in Western countries. "Up to the early 20th century, Type-1 diabetes was a horrible and dangerous disease, usually leading to people's death during their teens or early 20s," said lead study author Wenpeng You. "This meant there was limited opportunity for people with the disease to have children and to pass their genetic material onto future generations. In evolutionary terms, this is what we call 'natural selection'," he explained. However, with the widespread introduction of insulin from the 1920s onwards, and improvements in modern medicine, life expectancy for people with Type- diabetes has now increased to about 69 years. "That is a remarkable achievement, but it also means that with reduced natural selection, the genetic material leading to the development of type-1 diabetes may be accumulating at a rapid rate within the world's population," You noted. The findings were published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research &amp; Care. The researchers decided to investigate the link because although cases of Type-1 diabetes have been increasing globally, its prevalence is uneven in different parts of the world. "Not every country has access to good health care, or freely available insulin. In a number of poor countries, such as in Africa, the life expectancy for people with Type-1 diabetes is much lower than in the Western world. This means more people are dying prematurely, with less opportunity to produce offspring who will carry those genes from generation to generation," You said.</text>

	<text>An innovative experiment of raising charity funds through screening feature films in cinema halls seems to have come as a big relief for nine cancer-afflicted girls in Karnataka who are now looking forward to regular fund flows for uninterrupted treatment. Sreeraksha, Prajna, Amisha, Nafisathula Ifrath, Devapriya, Nidhi Kamat, Mariyam Saheera, Apeksha and Fathimath Misbha, undergoing treatment at the Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Mangalore, require monetary support - ranging from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.3 lakhs ($1,500-$4,500) - for cancer treatment. NGO CanKids Kidscan has joined hands with producers of Kannada film "The Plan" to raise awareness and funds for its Girl Child Project that offers treatment and support to girls with cancer. The funds collected by the NGO, along with the film's producers - Malgudi Talkies and Day Dream Creations - will support the nine girls in Mangalore by offering treatment, emotional and psychological support, transportation, nutrition, education, accommodation and social reintegration. For a daily wage labourer who is the father of nine-year-old Fathimath Misbha, diagnosed with Acute Lymphblastic Leukemia, the funds would be a blessing for his child. "We don't have money. If they don't help, we would stop the treatment," said Fathimath's father. The NGO and the film's producers are aiming to collect Rs.12 lakh through crowd funding for the nine girls through advance sale of tickets of a special re-release of the movie in Mangalore, Udupi, Karkala and Kundapur on April 22. The producers were about to release a free digital version of the movie on YouTube when a call for a donation from an acquaintance for the cancer treatment of a school girl threw up the idea of generating funds for charity through film screenings. The Mumbai-based Malgudi Talkies' chief Ashok Shetty said: "My friends suggested that rather than releasing a free version of the film on YouTube, we could re-release it on select screens and collect charity funds through advance sale of tickets." He said donors can contribute and save a girl's life and get free tickets of "The Plan" by visiting http://malguditalkies.in/shop/ The popular film, featuring Ananth Nag, Kousthubh Jayakumar, Hemanth, Sriram, Gauthami and Harish Roy, was first released in November. "We are going to colleges and cities to highlight the cause linked to the re-release of the film. We are aiming to collect Rs 12 lakh for the nine cancer bravehearts," Shetty said. "For every ticket that is sold, Rs.60 would be directed towards the treatment of the nine girls," said Shetty. Film director Keerthi said if the experiment for the cause is successful, they may continue to re-release the movie in other parts of the state too. All the nine girls undergoing treatment at KMC Hospital, Mangalore, are under the care of Dr. Harsha Prasad L, assistant professor in the department of paediatrics. "A majority of childhood cancers are curable. It is a crime not to seek medical help for a girl child with cancer," Prasad maintained. "The Girl Child Project campaign will help create awareness about the importance of treating girls similar to boys," he added. CanKids KidsCan chairman Poonam Bagai said: "Such a crowd funding initiative has been attempted first time by us in partnership with Malgudi Talkies and Day Dream Creations." "Gender discrimination in our country is prevalent at all levels. In a study in Haryana in 2013, we found that girls with cancer seem to be facing discrimination as compared to boys," she said. "Some parents do not want to inform relatives or neighbors about this ailment as it could hamper the marriage prospect of their other children," she said. The CanKids Girl Child project aims to strengthen and empower girl patients and survivors to become leaders and ambassador of childhood cancer, she said. CanKids Kidscan is a non-profit organization for childhood Cancer in India. It works on all aspects to bring a change in childhood cancer from support services to awareness, advocacy, stakeholder engagement, capacity building, quality care, research and impact. Cancer kills as many as 264 children per week in the country. As many as 13,726 deaths due to childhood cancer occurred in India in 2010, of which is 0.7 percent of deaths were among those aged one month to 14 years.</text>

	<text>At the second edition of the recently concluded Ice Cream Festival in the capital, there weren't just kulfis and ice creams, but also a variety of ice-cream-based desserts. Visitors told us that for those people who'd never tried an ice cream sandwich or ice cream roll, this fest was a must-visit. Desi-videshi combos Delhi's finest `ice-creamers' showcased a variety of ice creams, which included not only water-based ice cream, but also mirch kulfis, ice cream rolls and, of course, some international flavours. Ice cream lovers participated in competitions like speed blind tasting and the no-hands challenge. When we spoke to ice-creamers, they told us the flavour that was most in de mand was Belgian choco late. "Most people don't visit ice cream festivals because they don't know such events are taking place. People just happen to be in the area and they go for it. But once you have been there, you will always go back," Salma Khan, one of the visitors on the first day of the fest, said. Sugar-free sweets not in demand Dilip Singh, a staff member at one of the stalls, said, "We have fatfree and sugar-free ice cream, but these are the least popular types of ice cream. Ice cream lovers don't even look at them and weight-watchers try them once in a while. We still keep the option available, just in case someone wants it." "Most people prefer whipped cream, extra chocolate sauce and chocolate cookies," says Radhika Gupta, a home chef who prepares desserts with ice cream. She adds, "Chocolate, both dark and white, and ice cream are a treat for any chocolate lover. I use whipped cream and fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce while preparing the dish, and to decorate it too." Delhi likes it desi One of the most crowded outlets of the fest was the `India Gate ka chuski' stall, which, we were told, was the one that sells the most at the fest each year.At India Gate, vendors use their hands to grate the ice, but here, they used hands-free portable ice-graters. Which toppings do people want the most? Chocolate cookies, whipped cream and chocolate sauce were the most preferred toppings Not just ice creams The event wasn't just limited to different flavours of ice cream, but also offered a variety of ice-creambased desserts such as ice cream cakes Desi sweets rule the festival? Kulfis came in all flavours - some conventional, and others that were more unusual, such as the mirch kulfi Which dessert raked in the moolah? Chuskis are the biggest money-makers at the fest each year. The vendors use grating machines to crush the ice Step by step Some desserts drew crowds not just for their taste, but also for their intriguing preparation process, like the ice cream roll</text>

	<text>Actress Dakota Johnson appeared with a new look in her new tousled bob-length locks. The actress, best known as Anastasia Steele in "Fifty Shades of Grey", was spotted hanging out here wearing her newly lobbed hair on Wednesday. Teaming her new hairdo with skinny jeans, grey coat, boots and round glasses, the 25-year-old actress looked more fresh, reports aceshowbiz.com. The bob cut suits her so much as it frames her face nicely. Johnson appeared in "Fifty Shades of Grey" with her long brunette hair. In the movie, she used to style her hair into a braid which definitely matched the character's innocent disposition. "Fifty Shades of Grey" was based on erotic romance novel written by E. L. James under the same title. Directed by Sam Taylor-Jonson with a screenplay by Kelly Marcet, the movie also starred Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Eloise Mumford as Katherine Kavanagh.</text>

	<text>Title: Indian Family Business Mantras; Authors: Peter Leach and Tatwamasi Dixit; Publisher: Rupa; Pages: 252; Price: Rs.595 True to its title, the book summarises the spirit of Indian family businesses. It has not only captured the positive side of family-run business but also highlighted the various challenges faced by such companies. The book, written by family business expert and a partner at Deloitte UK, Peter Leach, and Tatwamasi Dixit, Vedic scholar and family business consultant, clearly indicates the traits of family businesses in India. It speaks about how family business helps to easily identify the talent in the top management as these people are mostly family members themselves. On the other hand, the book highlights how members often get complacent and businesses nosedive. The authors have also highlighted how disputes between siblings lead to destruction of family businesses. Once a dispute arises, the focus of energy is on resolving it rather than on the business. It says flexibility in thinking and the spirit of give and take are essential in resolving disputes, rather than becoming involved in indirect communications which can deepen misunderstandings, resulting in disputes leading to destruction. It has analyses of some of the top Indian business families including Tata Group, Biocon, Ranbaxy, Murugappa Group, GMR Group, Termax and Godrej among others. The book compared how the Western world has in the last five centuries witnessed tremendous wealth creation, and family businesses have thrived. Good family governance is fundamental to foster good corporate governance, it explains. While globalisation has brought new perspectives to the Indian system, human values and family traditions remain at the fulcrum of family businesses in India. "Family enterprise has been one of the most prevalent and resilient business forms over centuries and across continents. It represents a cornerstone of the world economy and, according to some estimates, family-managed businesses generate well over half the world's GDP," the book says. There are many family businesses worldwide but Indian family businesses are unique and have their own governing characteristics. They showcase a distinct, ingrained value system that includes the socio-political concepts of Sama, Dana, Bheda and Danda - Hindu philosophy's four approaches to human interaction, it says. But the book also said Indian family businesses are in difficult times as many family businesses with aging patriarchs are having to face up to pressing decisions about what should happen next. Many next-generation family members are attending universities and business schools in Europe, Britain and the United States, and are returning home to experience a severe disconnect between what they have learned and family business practices in India. Successful family businesses tend to be stable structures. They are often durable, low-profile, profitable and niche enterprises that shun publicity. Commitment and a stable culture lie behind the fact that family businesses are generally very solid and reliable structures - and are perceived as such in the marketplace. It says Indian family businesses have traditionally been dominated by men and although this is beginning to change, progress is slow and tentative, with gender issues continuing to cause significant tensions and inefficiencies in India's family-owned companies.</text>

	<text>Three experts tell us how they approach diabetes and offer remedial measures. Dr. Narendra Bhatt, Ayurvedic doctor Ayurvedic texts have described `Madhumeha', which is similar to diabetes as one of the 20 forms of dysuria. While Madhumeha falls under, vaat -the cosmic phenomenon is functionally represented in human body in terms of vaat (air), pitta(fire) and kapha(earth) -category of dysuria, the role of agni, the metabolic factor and disturbances of urinary and sweat channels, are of great significance too. One of the greatest strengths of ayurveda is in identifying possible causative factors that relate to clinical manifestation, excessive urinary flow is one such. Careful study of lifestyle can help identify the cause for the illness in an individual. Diet, not only in terms of the quality of food, but when and in what manner you eat are equally important. Irregular timings of food intake or eating dinner continuously late are definite invitation to this illness. Sedentary lifestyle, particularly working on computers and use of air-conditioners, are other contributing factors, as these lead to controlled metabolic circulation against natural processes, which must be in sync with the environment. Those who travel frequently by air or in airconditioned cars -if not balanced with physical activities -are susceptible to early onset of this disease. Ayurveda also acknowledges that diabetes is a genetically predisposed disease and can be tackled by following a proper diet. The best solution I could offer is to exercise and to go for regular walks. There is no substitute to walking for prevention or management of diabetes. Abhishek Sharma, Yoga teacher Diabetes is acknowledged as a lifestyle disease. It's the disorder of the metabolic system. Yoga offers prevention, helps in the management of diabetes and in some cases even cures it. This is because yoga offers a holistic regime. It creates a balance in the body. It works on the system as a whole, and brings equilibrium in the body.Yoga works on balancing the nervous system, endocrine system, and helps the coordination between different systems in the body. While yoga in totality is helpful for diabetics, there are some asanas and pranayam that are specifically beneficial. Ardha matsyendra, which essentially is a spinal twist, is very effective for one. The posture compresses pancreas, kidneys and stimulates digestion and squeezes out toxins. It rejuvenates the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Urdhva-mukh Svanasanis another powerful pose that awakens upper-body strength and offers a wonderful stretch for the chest and abdomen. Be cause you're holding the stretch in the abdomen region, you are increasing the blood circulation in the area and the effect it has on digestive system is great. This, if practised along with SHASHANKASANA -performed by lowering your body and placing your head on floor -in rhythm, is extremely beneficial. It improves the function of the pancreas, kidney and intestine. Surya Namaskar, a series of 12 asanas performed in a dynamic manner -increases the blood circulation in the entire system.It tones the spine and stomach, and helps in the coordination of the different systems in the body, which helps in diabetes. It rejuvenates the entire body. Anulom vilom - or alternate nostril breathing exercise -is one of the main practices of pranayama.The entire nervous system and the endocrine system creates an equilibrium in the system and regulates the secretion of different glands in the body. It also helps to calm the nerves and reduce stress, which also is a big factor in diabetes. Kapalbhati (refer to the process below) is a breathing technique that directly stimulates the pancreas. It also helps the body get rid of toxins and increases the metabolic rate.D Elongate your spine upwards, lengthen your neck and bring your chin back. Relax your stomach muscles. D Now expel the air as forcefully as you are comfortable with through the nose. This should cause the abdominal muscles to con tract and should draw the abdomen inwards towards the spine (like when you suck in your stomach). Then allow the inhalation to occur passively. To repeat, the exhalation is done using conscious force, while the inhalation is just a recoil action bringing the air back into the lungs. All the breathing takes place through the nose. Right after the pas sive inhalation, exhale again forcefully and continue at a steady rhythm. Dr.Manish Motwani , Bariatric surgeon Obesity is a complex, clinical disorder. Studies have proven that there are many detrimental health effects of obesity with an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, gall bladder disease, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic musculoskeletal problems, polycystic ovary syndrome, infertility, psychosocial problem as well as some forms of cancer. Bariatrics is the field of medicine that specialises in treating obesity.Bariatric surgical procedures bring about major weight loss for people with morbid obesity. But let me point out, weight loss surgery is not only for obese people, but also for those who are unable to shed weight through dieting or other hormonal problems. What weight loss surgery does is it causes pro found changes in the incretions -hormones in the gastrointestinal tract that cause insulin to be released. Another reason for control of diabetes after laparoscopic weight loss surgery is significant weight loss and reduced dietary intake. These changes lead to significant improvement in Type 2 diabetes and can cause long-term changes in the pancreas that causes diabetes to go away. These changes help individuals: Get remission for Type 2 diabetes Decrease the amount of medications they need on a daily basis Postpone the onset of diabetes (especially for individuals with pre-diabetes). Obesity is a grave disease and root cause of various medical problems. The best treatment for obesity is prevention. So, healthy lifestyle choices would ensure long-term fitness. Bariatric surgery, also called metabolic surgery is a safe and proven option for morbid obesity and diabetes and the only method in the world giving a cue rate of more than 75-80 per cent. A word of caution- A patient, especially if he/she suffers from diabetes, must take preventive measures after a bariatric surgery. Various preventive measures that must be adopted post bariatric surgery are: Close follow-up postoperatively is needed because of the high risk of hypoglycaemia. No self-medication or self-reduction of medicines. These should be supervised by endocrinologists.Regular follow up meetings with a nutritionist. Diet post-surgery should be systematic and supervised.</text>

	<text>Kidneys are remarkable organs. Inside them are millions of small units known as nephrons that act as filters. Their job is to remove waste products from the blood. Sometimes this filtering system breaks down. Diabetes can damage the kidneys and cause them to fail. Failing kidneys lose their ability to filter out waste products, resulting in kidney disease. Diabetic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy) is a complication that occurs in some people with diabetes. In this condition the filters of the kidneys, the glomeruli (part of nephron), become damaged. Because of this the kidneys 'leak' abnormal amounts of protein from the blood into the urine. The main protein that leaks out from the damaged kidneys is albumin. In normal healthy kidneys only a tiny amount of albumin is found in the urine. A raised level of albumin in the urine is the typical first sign that the kidneys have become damaged by diabetes. Diabetic kidney disease is divided into two main categories, depending on how much albumin is lost through the kidneys: Microalbuminuria- This is when the amount of albumin that leaks into the urine is between 30 and 300 mg per day. It is sometimes called incipient nephropathy. Proteinuria- This is when the amount of albumin that leaks into the urine is more than 300 mg per day. It is sometimes called macroalbuminuria or overt nephropathy. How does diabetic kidney disease develop and progress? A raised blood sugar (glucose) level that occurs in people with diabetes can cause albumin to leak into the urine. In addition, the raised blood glucose level may cause some proteins in the glomeruli to link together. These 'cross-linked' proteins can trigger a localised scarring process. This scarring process in the glomeruli is called glomerulosclerosis. It usually takes several years for glomerulosclerosis to develop and it only happens in some people with diabetes. As the condition becomes worse, scarred tissue (glomerulosclerosis) gradually replaces healthy kidney tissue. As a result, the kidneys become less and less able to do their job of filtering the blood. This gradual 'failing' of the kidneys may gradually progress to what is known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Who gets kidney disease? Not everyone with diabetes develops kidney disease. Factors that can influence kidney disease development include genetics, blood sugar control, and blood pressure. The better a person keeps diabetes and blood pressure under control, the lower the chance of getting kidney disease. As per research studies, the rate of decline of kidney function in Indian elderly men with diabetes is very rapid. What are the symptoms? The kidneys work hard to make up for the failing capillaries so kidney disease produces no symptoms until almost all function is gone. Also, the symptoms of kidney disease are not specific. The first symptom of kidney disease is often fluid build-up. Other symptoms of kidney disease include loss of sleep, poor appetite, upset stomach, weakness, and difficulty concentrating. It is vital to see a doctor regularly. The doctor can check blood pressure, urine (for protein), blood (for waste products), and organs for other complications of diabetes. Diabetic kidney disease can be prevented by keeping blood sugar in your target range.

	<Heading>Drawing inspiration from vintage fashion</Heading>

	<text>We joke that we're the dirty secret of the fashion world," says Doug Gunn, co-founder of The Vintage Showroom, which houses army fatigues, nylon bombers, Japanese embroidered tour jackets and assorted Americana from decades past. He acts as a clothes farm for high-end designers hunting out inspiration. How he's kept it confidential is a miracle  some 50,000 pieces of vintage clothing span his Covent Garden shop and a private warehouse in Notting Hill. But operating in secret is what his clients require. He is in the vintage sourcing business, renting out garments to high-end fashion houses. These items of clothing ultimately inform the prevailing mood or theme of a label's next collection. At 24, David Casavant's New York archive of vintage Raf Simons and Helmut Lang garments has fast become a go-to for Kanye West, Rihanna and rapper Travis Scott. They borrow from his back catalogue for performances or appearances. However, Casavant also loans out to a few major American menswear and denim brands that show on the fashion calendar. "Helmut's a huge draw," he says, "more just from a research standpoint because his clothes are innovative and more constructed." Casavant is proud of his near-complete collection of Simons and Lang, which has swelled to more than 1,000 pieces and has become increasingly scarce. Paul Lawrence, who owns November Books, is one name designers seek out if they're tracking down rare books or visuals to populate their boards. "If people have an idea of what they're looking for but they don't know exactly what material would be available, they'll often ask and I'll go away and find out what exists, whether it's been seen before by anybody else," he says. Top-tier luxury brands often employ someone in a full-time position to source inspiration. These aren't trend forecasters. They are simply inspiration hounds, paid for time their creative director doesn't have. They may do the legwork themselves, but more likely act as inspiration "managers", liaising between vintage sourcers, book shops and the designer. When you're trying to keep up on fashion's proverbial treadmill, there is no time to absorb ideas. "People don't always have time to digest and understand what they're working with or why they're doing something. They're a commercial fashion business. They have to show at least two times a year. They have to produce 50, 60, 70 looks. This doesn't give you much time for reflection," Lawerence says. Luxe fashion is fuelled by exclusivity, so those creating it need to be experts at hiding their sources. "The last few seasons we got a collection of grizzly motorcycle jackets which were a kind of North American biker jacket in leather and sheepskin," explains Gunn. "That's an example of a piece that has been quite literally taken from a vintage garment and different houses have put their own take on it."</text>

	<text>An Indian author who has penned five books so far, Jaishree Misra is one of the 11 TOI Write India authors. In a recent conversation, she shared her expectations from Write India and her experience at the three-day Times Lit Fest Delhi. Excerpts: What do you feel about Write India? I think it's a fabulous way to find new talent while also promoting existing authors. I cannot think of a precedent for such an initiative at all which seems curious, given how simple the concept is. What is also wonderful is the spread of genres and styles covered by the writers who have signed up to the scheme. Between commercial fiction, literary fiction, mythological fiction, historical fiction, romantic fiction... a budding fiction writer has such a rich collection to choose from. What are your expectations from Write India? I fully expect that the competition will throw up at least two or three great new voices that will have publishers scrambling to pull on board. This is likely to happen in a totally unpredictable way as who knows which preface is likely to inspire the best talent. What I would say to the competitors is to try their hand at as many of the stories as possible. When one is starting out, it isn't always clear what genre will best suit one's style and interests. Here then is one way to find out! What kind of a story appeals to you? Which is the book closest to your heart? I write in a kind of half-way house between literary and commercial fiction and enjoy this kind of crossover fiction. Strong stories that are lucid, honest, accessible and written in straightforward prose, neither too flowery nor too plain. Author David Nichols is my current favourite - a book called 'One Day' had me weep and laugh out loud and took me to experiences that I would never have otherwise known. It's a rare treat to find a book which can do all of those things at once. Among Indian writers my favourite is Vikram Seth, mostly for his versatility and, of course, his towering intellect and skill. Any tips you would like to share with the aspiring writers? Try to think of the bare bones of a story and then just start to write. The words will start to flow if there's a story bursting to come out. Don't worry about editing and shaping at this stage because you will have many subsequent drafts to do all the correcting and 'cleaning up'. Never ever imagine that the story is ready to be submitted as soon as it is written. You need to let it stew for a while and then go back to it with a fresh mind to spot all the things that would improve and enhance it. Tell us about your experience at the Times LitFest and are you looking forward to it next year? It was mad and chaotic and lots of fun but what else can one expect from a crazy city like Delhi! Generally the festival events I've attended are a lot more formal, with a definite 'panel discussion' type of structure followed by a controlled Q&amp;A with the audience. Perhaps it was due to the fairly intimate kind of space we had been provided or maybe it was the topic itself (Love and Longing In Indian Fiction) but the audience was a highly engaged one, wanting to be involved from the start, and the moderator had the sense to go with the flow. It felt like a really relaxed party where everyone was doing their own thing and having fun. What are you currently working on? Are you penning down another book? I'm in Kerala at the moment developing my seaside 'writer's retreat' that I hope to offer to struggling writers someday. The writing has had to take a back-seat in that but I can now feel an idea started to bubble away at the back of my mind. It will need to be about Kerala, of course, and could become my first book of non-fiction! By Garima Chamoli</text>

	<text>Title: The End of Plenty: A Global Food Crisis Author: Joel K. Bourne Jr Publisher: Speaking Tiger Pages: 408 Price: Rs.499 With global food shortage peaking in the past decade, American author Joel K. Bourne Jr. paints the vision of an apocalyptic future for humankind if concerted efforts are not made to ward off what Robert Malthus had predicted as the coming of an "agricultural Armageddon." The ideas of the 18th century economist, Malthus, who wrote the classic "Essay on the Principle of Population", are at the heart of "The End of Plenty". Malthus predicted that while human populations will increase at a geometric rate, food production will grow much slower in comparison till, at a point, population growth will exceed the food supply, leading the planet towards certain catastrophe. The burden of "The End of Plenty" is that the global food shortage, which has reached an all-time high over the past decade, is only going to get worse. Bourne's thesis is that the world is not producing enough food for the population - and in a manner that rapidly integrates ecologically destructive and unhealthy methods and technologies to produce larger quantities. The physically harmful techniques include the use of genetically modified crops, synthetic pesticides and fertilizers and technologically-induced water-intensive irrigation involving much use of this precious resource. As a result of the food shortage, prices continue to rise, leaving billions locked in a continuous struggle to afford their meals - or even eat. Bourne cites the Earth Policy Institute to say that as more grain has been diverted to livestock and to the production of biofuels for cars, annual worldwide consumption of grain has risen from 815 million tonnes in 1960 to 2.16 billion in 2008. People are working ways to increase the world's food supply but if population growth is not curbed and if the world continues on its present track, disaster is inevitable, he says. "The End of Plenty" is replete with studies, statistics and facts that Bourne, as a science journalist, has gathered over half-a-century. The mass of cold data, however, is compellingly interwoven with sensory details and imagery. An example is the way Bourne begins. "It is the simplest, most natural of acts, akin to breathing and walking upright. We sit down at the dinner table, pick up a fork and take a juicy bite, oblivious to the double helping of global ramifications on our plate." His account is illustrated with stories from the world over, while India, particularly Punjab, finds central place. He begins with the Bengal Famine of 1943, which killed as many as four million people, and for the following two decades India had to import millions of tonnes of grain to feed its people. With grim examples from Punjab, a state currently in the throes of various agitations, including by farmers, Bourne details the environmental costs of the Green Revolution in India, a country that also has the most number of malnourished. "Better seeds, combined with more fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation, enabled farmers to grow more crop from each acre. Farmers grew so much extra food during the 1960s that they actually helped alleviate global poverty by making food cheaper in most places around the world," he writes. The miracle of the Green Revolution is over in Punjab. Yield growth has tapered off since the mid-1990s. Over-irrigation has led to steep drops in the water table, now tapped by 1.3 million tube wells, while thousands of hectares of productive land have been lost to salinization and waterlogged soil. "Forty years of intensive irrigation, fertilization, and pesticides have not been kind to the loamy gray fields of Punjab. Nor, in some cases, to the people themselves," says Bourne, recounting the tragedy of families stricken by cancer from long exposure to pesticides in food. "Researchers have found pesticides in the Punjabi farmers' blood, their water table, their vegetables, even their wives' breast milk. So many people take the train from the Malwa region to the cancer hospital in Bikaner that it's now called the Cancer Express." To compound the misery, the high cost of fertilizer and pesticides has plunged many Punjabi farmers into debt. One study found more than 1,400 cases of farmers' suicides in 93 villages between 1988 and 2006. According to Bourne, some groups put the total for the state as high as 40,000 to 60,000 suicides over that period. Bourne considers the conditions to restore plenty, including those of land, seed, water and organic farming, but all roads finally lead back to his point of departure - Malthus, who in 1798 wrote..."that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man". The American government and the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations earlier funded a birth control programme in India as part of the Green Revolution, and through the World Bank also financed a sterilisation campaign in the country. However, "The End of Plenty" required to offer a deeper understanding of gender and women's empowerment that is a precondition for effective population control, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. The gap in Bourne's analysis appears more glaring when held up against conditions in India's breadbasket - a strategic border state battling huge problems of drug addiction among male youth, and which almost scrapes the bottom of the barrel among states on the ratio of its female population to males.</text>

	<text>HYDERABAD: With yet another 'residence camp office' for chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Hyderabad, the financial burden for frequent change of offices and CMO now stands at Rs 80 crore. This is Naidu's fourth camp office in Hyderabad. The government has set up as many as five camp offices and two regular offices for Naidu in the last two years. Most of the money was spent on providing security measures and sprucing up the buildings. Yet another 'interim' office for the chief minister will be added to the tally when the chief minister shifts from his present camp office in Vijayawada to the upcoming interim government complex at Velagapudi village on the other side of the Krishna river in July. And when the final secretariat is constructed a couple of years later, Naidu will again shift his office for the ninth time. The state government on Thursday issued orders declaring the residence of Chandrababu Naidu at Madinaguda in Hyderabad as the 'residence camp office' whenever he visits the joint capital city. The government has already spent about Rs 2 crore on the Madinaguda residence. Orders were issued on April 6 sanctioning Rs 57 lakh and on April 1 for Rs 1.36 crore, mostly on security measures. Earlier, two more places in Hyderabad where Naidu had stayed were also declared as residence camp offices. About Rs 2 crore was spent on Naidu's residences on road no 24 and 65 in Jubilee Hills. The government also spent about Rs 45 lakh on security and renovation of the Lake View Guest House, which served as the camp office for a brief period, and the chief minister's office (CMO) in the state secretariat. First, the H block was spruced up and later the L block. None of them is being used now as Naidu has shifted to Vijayawada, where a temporary camp office was set up at a cost of about Rs 21 crore. The government issued orders on different occasions sanctioning funds under various heads for the camp office. Once the interim government complex at Velagapudi is ready, Naidu will shift from Vijayawada city. The complex that will also house secretariat and state assembly is coming up at a cost of about Rs 530 crore.</text>

	<text>BENGALURU: Of the 322 nursing institutes sanctioned by the Karnataka government in 2007-08, only 280 institutes have applied for affiliation this year to admit new students, leaving 42 institutes non-functional for this academic year, records of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) show. Karnataka boasts of the highest number of nursing institutes in the country, but there has been a consistent dip in the number of students applying each year, leading to 42 institutes going without a single student this year, say various stakeholders in nursing education. Dr Riyaz Basha, deputy registrar, RGUHS, said: "To continue admitting students every year in the three nursing courses -Bachelor of Science (BSc), Master of Science (MSc) and Post Certificate Bachelor of Science (PC BSc) -the sanctioned institutes have to renew their university affiliation by applying for it." "The university conducts an inspection and sends a report to the academic council, which decides who will give the permit.This year, we got applications from 280 institutes.The remaining 42 will, therefore, not be allowed to admit students for this acade mic year," he added. Working nurses, students and experts dealing with nursing education blamed the situation on poor infrastructure, lack of faculty , low pay scales and awareness among students about the profession. "When I applied for a job at city hospitals, I was turned down by most as I did not pass out from a quality institute, though I had paid about Rs 3 lakh for the degree. I got a job after going door to door, and I am paid peanuts. I have dissuaded my sister from joining my profession, though I'm proud of my service towards ailing people," said a nurse who joined a city hospital last year. Many colleges have been asked to shut down because of inadequate infras tructure and lack of clinical experi ence of the faculty. Hospitals in other states are not ready to employ nurses from any institute. Apart from premier institutes like Nimhans, students are not provided quality education everywhere. So most students opt for a few reputed institutes and the colleges without quality infrastructure don't get students," said Sailaxmi Gandhi, associate professor, department of nursing in Nimhans. "A low pay scale is also responsible for not attracting students. Although Nimhans gives a good pay package, salaries in other hospitals are very low. While nursing homes pay only Rs 2,000, private hospitals pay Rs 8,000-Rs 13,000," she pointed out. Ivan Nigli, former MLA and chairman of the Anglo Indian Unity Centre, said: "Students are hardly aware about nursing institutes as they are never promoted like engineering or MBA. There is an urgent need to promote this profession at all levels." "The pay scale should be increased. The government should appoint one nurse in every school to give a boost to this community," Nigli added. "Now that Kerala has its own nursing institutes and hospitals, students prefer to stay there. Karnataka institutes have seen a major dip in admissions to its colleges," said Sailaxmi Gandh, associate professor, Nimhans.</text>

	<text>DHAKA: At least 42 people, including women and children, were killed in Bangladesh within the last 24 hours after being struck by lightning during thundershowers, officials said on Friday. Meteorological office said the downpour brought with it thundershowers in 14 districts, including Dhaka. Nine people were killed in five districts on Friday as rain has been lashing several parts of the country after a spell of heat waves. Thirty-three people, including children and women, were killed on Thursday in 12 different districts. The lightning that accompanied the seasonal nor'wester storms claimed the highest eight lives in northwestern Pabna, five each in neighbouring Sirajganj and Rajshahi districts. Police said Dhaka, Chittagong, Joypurhat and Naogaon saw two deaths each while one person died after being struck by bolt in Sunamganj on Friday. In Dhaka, sudden thunderbolts killed two engineering students when they were playing football in the rain. Four persons died in Kishoreganj and Brahmanbarhia each, reports said. Eleven more deaths were reported from other parts of the country. The casualties included a number of children who were playing in open grounds during the rain but mostly the victims were farmers, including women, who were in their fields. Rains appeared as a welcome shower after a heat wave scorched the country, but the downpour brought with it the lightning that caused the unusually high number of casualties. "Bangladesh witnesses the seasonal nor'wester storm every year from March to May when the thunderbolts also occur," meteorologist Hafizur Rahman said adding that the phenomenon appears mostly in northwestern Rajsahi and Sylhet regions. Fellow meteorologist Sujit Kumar Deb Sharma said lightning kills up to 300 people on an average each year in Bangladesh though not all the incidents were not reported in the media. The Met office has predicted rain or thundershowers with gusty or squally wind today in Dhaka, and in northwestern and northeastern regions. Some areas in southwestern and northwestern parts of the country may also receive rain and thundershowers.</text>

	<text>DHAKA: At least 29 people, including children and women, were killed in Bangladesh on Thursday after being struck by lightning in Dhaka and several other districts. Five of them were killed in Sirajganj, four in Pabna, Kishoreganj and Brahmanbarhia each, three in Rajshahi, two in Gazipur, Bogra and Natore each, and one in Habiganj during thunderstorms on Thursday, bdnews24.com reported.

	<text>KATHMANDU: After a two-year hiatus in the wake of deadly avalanches and last year's earthquake, the world's highest peak Mt Everest saw the first ascent on Wednesday as nine Nepali Sherpas made their way to the top of the mountain. Mt Everest did not see any climbing activity in 2014 due to avalanches which claimed the lives of 19 climbers and porters and in 2015 following the April earthquake. Gyanendra Shrestha, an official of the department of tourism, said those who have succeeded to reach the top are the Ice-fall Doctors who prepared the route up to Mt Everest. He said that nearly 12 foreign mountaineers are preparing to climb Mt Everest on Thursday. "The weather is good so far. If things go as planned, the climbers will be able to reach the world's highest peak on Thursday." At least 289 climbers are aiming to climb Mt Everest this season. Normally, 50-60 percent climbers make it to the top of Everest. They will be accompanied by at least 400 Nepali high-altitude guides, which means the Everest will see a footfall of more than 600 individuals this season. A team of Indian Army, including youth from the Indian National Cadet Corps, is also vying for the top of Mt Everest.</text>

	<text>PYONGYANG: North Korea expelled a BBC journalist on Monday over his reporting, the broadcaster and a North Korean official said, as a large group of foreign media members visited the isolated country to cover a rare ruling party congress. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes was detained on Friday as he was about to leave the country and taken away for eight hours of questioning and "made to sign a statement", the network said. The British reporter was on a flight for Beijing on Monday afternoon along with a BBC producer and cameraman he was traveling with, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Wingfield-Hayes had "distorted facts and realities" in his coverage, North Korean official O Ryong Il said in announcing that Wingfield-Hayes, who is based in Tokyo, was being expelled and would never be let in again. "They were speaking very ill of the system, the leadership of the country," O, who is secretary general of a National Peace Committee, told reporters in Pyongyang, according to a video clip published by the Associated Press. Another BBC correspondent in Pyongyang, John Sudworth, said in a broadcast report there was "disagreement, a concern over the content of Rupert's reporting", including questioning the authenticity of a hospital. In his report of a visit to the children's hospital in Pyongyang, Wingfield-Hayes said the patients looked "remarkably well" and there was not a real doctor on duty. "Everything we see looks like a set-up" he said. In another report, Wingfield-Hayes noted that his official minders were "rather upset with us" over trying to do a report in front of a statute of founding leader Kim Il Sung. "They clearly felt we said stuff that was not respectful," of Kim, he said in his report. "Now, we are in trouble," he said, adding that the BBC team had been told to delete its footage. Sudworth said in his report Wingfield-Hayes had been prevented from leaving on Friday and taken away. "(He) was separated from the rest of his team, prevented from boarding that flight, taken to a hotel and interrogated by the security bureau here in Pyongyang before being made to sign a statement and then released, eventually allowed to rejoin us here in this hotel," Sudworth said. CLOSELY WATCHED A BBC spokesman said four BBC staff remained in the country and he expected they would be allowed to stay. "We are very disappointed that our reporter Rupert Wingfield-Hayes and his team have been deported from North Korea after the government took offense at material he had filed," the spokesman said. The eight-hour interrogation was conducted by a man who introduced himself to Wingfield-Hayes as the person who prosecuted Kenneth Bae, an American missionary who had been held by the North for two years for crimes against the state, said another BBC correspondent in Pyongyang, Stephen Evans. Bae was released in November 2014. North Korea granted visas to an unusually large group of 128 journalists from 12 countries to coincide with the Workers' Party congress. Their movements are closely managed and as of mid-day on Monday they had yet to get access to the proceedings of the congress, which began on Friday. Instead, they had been taken to show-case sites including a maternity hospital, an electric cable plant and a children's center. On Monday, visiting media were taken to a textile factory named after Kim Jong Suk, the grandmother of the country's young leader. The North Korean government, which owns and operates all domestic news media organizations, maintains tight control over foreign reporters, with government "minders" accompanying visiting journalists as they report. Wingfield-Hayes had been in town ahead of the congress to cover the visit of a group of Nobel laureates. North Korea said it would strengthen self-defensive nuclear weapons capability in a decision adopted at the congress, its KCNA news agency reported on Monday, in defiance of U.N. resolutions.</text>

	<text>KATHMANDU: Climbers are making good progress on Mount Everest and the first group could reach the summit as early as Thursday, following two years of disasters on the world's highest mountain, a mountaineering official said on Tuesday. Nearly 300 foreign climbers and their guides are attempting to reach the 8,850-metre summit. Nepal Mountaineering Department official Gyanendra Shrestha, who is stationed at the base camp, said that the last camp at South Col has been set up and the route to the summit was being fixed on Tuesday. The South Col, or Camp 4, is located at about 8,000-metres altitude and is the last place for climbers to pause before they try to reach the summit. Tents there have basic gear, supplies and oxygen cylinders. He said weather was favourable for climbing with only light snow fall on Tuesday. Nepal is hoping for a safe 2016 season, after an avalanche triggered by a powerful earthquake killed 19 climbers and injured 61 others at base camp in 2015. In 2014, 16 Sherpa guides were killed by an avalanche above the base camp. The two disasters largely emptied the peak. The climbing season in 2015 was scrubbed, and nearly all of the climbers in 2014 abandoned their attempts after the avalanche. The only team who reached the summit that year from the Nepal side was a Chinese woman and her five Sherpa guides.</text>

"Based on a tip-off, a coalition forces' drone carried out an air raid against a vehicle running in Nah-r-Sufi locality of Chahar Dara district on Monday night. The air strike left seven militants killed and two other militants injured," district Governor Zulmai Farooqi told Xinhua.

	<text>DHAKA: A 75-year-old Buddhist monk was found hacked to death Saturday in Bangladesh's remote southeastern district of Bandarban, police said, the latest in a spate of murders of religious minorities and secular activists. The body of Maung Shue U. Chak was found Saturday morning by his daughter-in-law when she went to give him some food, local police official Abul Khayer said. His throat had been slit overnight. While no one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing, it follows a slew of murders in recent years of members of religious minority groups, foreigners, atheist bloggers and secular publishers in Bangladesh by suspected Islamist radicals. The killings have come amid growing concern that religious extremism is gaining ground in the Muslim-majority nation of 160 million. The Islamic State group and an al-Qaida-linked group have claimed responsibility for some of the recent killings. But the authorities in Bangladesh insist that neither of the groups has a presence in the country. Instead, the authorities have blamed political opposition and local militant groups for the violence. Last month, suspected Islamist militants killed two prominent gay rights activists, an atheist student and a university professor. Read this story in Marathi</text>

	<text>DHAKA: Fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami chief and 1971 war crimes convict Motiur Rahman Nizami has been shifted to Dhaka Central Jail from a suburban prison as his execution seemed imminent. "He (Nizami) has been brought here (Dhaka Jail) last night as part of the process to execute the Supreme Court verdict. We are prepared to carry out the process in Dhaka Central Jail," a senior prison official said. He said the 73-year-old top leader of Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party was kept in an isolated cell in the prison "as per procedure". Prison authorities, however, were still waiting for the copy of the Supreme Court judgement. "I can't tell you when the death sentence will be executed but what I want to say is that the verdict will be carried out after exhausting all legal procedures," said Home Minister Asaduzzaman Kamal. Nizami's final appeal against his death sentence for war crimes committed during the 1971 Liberation War against Pakistan was rejected by the Supreme Court on May 5. He was brought to the capital in a special prison van escorted by a number of police vehicles from the Kashimpur Central Jail. According to witnesses, security vigil was intensified overnight around the prison in the old part of Dhaka with elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) forces deployed along with police in riot gear. He was given capital punishment in October 2014 after being convicted of "superior responsibility" as the chief of the infamous Al-Badr militia forces in 1971. Nizami lost exhausted his legal options on May 5 when the Court reconfirmed his death penalty, upholding its previous judgement that had confirmed his death sentence. Family members met him the next day at suburban Kashimpur Central Jail. Nizami, a former lawmaker and minister in ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia's cabinet, has been in jail since 2010, when he was arrested to be tried 1971 war crimes in the ICT-BD which handed him down death penalty on October 29, 2014 on charges of mass murder, arson, loot and rape.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Notwithstanding the current chill in bilateral ties, India said on Thursday that it was fully committed to Nepal's socio-economic development and there was no reduction in aid extended by it to the Himalayan nation. The statement came in the backdrop of reports that China has overtaken India as the top donor country to Nepal. "I think this comparison is completely wrong. I have also seen these reports which say that India's aid to Nepal is $22.23 million. This is a misleading figure which totally distorts the picture. Actual funds released to assist Nepal from the Ministry of External Affair's (MEA) 'Aid-to-Nepal budget' are in the range of Rs 300 to 400 crore annually," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said. The discrepancy could be because a good part of our aid is not necessarily routed through the Nepalese treasury. Giving details of the assistance provided to Nepal in various sectors, he said major payments include about 3000 scholarships to Nepalese students annually and training for over 700 Nepalese citizens from security, economic and other organizations accounting for about Rs 75 crore. In addition, we have approximately 20 Small Development Projects, he said, and noted, "Four Lines of Credit totalling $1.65 billion are available for utilization, of which only $150 million has been disbursed since 2010. Its interest equalization is borne by MEA. We look forward to their speedy utilization." India also pays pension to ex-Gorkha soldiers, which is about Rs 1800 crore per year, he said, adding assistance under 'Operation Maitri' after the earthquake in Nepal last year was to the tune of Rs 400 crore. "India is fully committed to Nepal's socio-economic development. There is no aid cut in the case ofNepal," Swarup said. Initial allocations of aid to Nepal and other neighbouring countries are based on actual expenditure levels in the preceding years and take into account absorption capacity of our valued partners, he said. "If there is sufficient expenditure and more is required, funds are sought by MEA at Revised Estimate stage in the financial year. So more can and will be provided if and when required," he added. Nepal had last week cancelled the visit of its President Bhidya Devi Bhandari to India and recalled its envoy to New Delhi Deep Kumar Upadhyay amidst reports that it suspected New Delhi of attempting to topple the K P Oli government. However, Indian officials had denied the charge. When asked about India's representation at an International Buddhist conference in Nepal next week, Swarup said that it will be represented at an "approriate level". There were media reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar were likely to attend the conference.</text>

	<text>DAVAO: Incendiary Philippine politician Rodrigo Duterte vowed on Tuesday a relentless crackdown on crime after claiming a landslide presidential victory built on foul-mouthed populist tirades that exposed deep voter anger at the establishment. The 71-year-old firebrand stormed to victory in Monday's election, securing an insurmountable lead of nearly six million votes over his nearest rival, as a growing global howl for strong, populist leaders swept across the Southeast Asian nation. Duterte, the longtime mayor of the southern city of Davao, captivated Filipinos with vows of brutal but quick solutions to crime and poverty, while offering himself as a decisive strongman capable of resolving a host of other deeply entrenched problems in society. "It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people," Duterte told AFP in Davao early on Tuesday morning as the results came in. "I feel a sense of gratitude to the Filipino people." In other comments to reporters who had converged on Davao, Duterte offered an olive branch to his rivals following a deeply divisive campaign that had seen President Benigno Aquino brand him a dictator in the making who would bring terror to the nation. "I want to reach out my hand and let us begin the healing now," said Duterte, whose campaigning style and ability to upend conventional political wisdom have drawn comparisons with US Republican Donald Trump. However Duterte vowed to push through on the central plank of his campaign platform -- ending crime across the nation within six months and eliminating corruption. On the campaign trail he had enraged critics but hypnotized fans with profanity-laced promises to kill tens of thousands of criminals, forget human rights laws and pardon himself for mass murder. While avoiding such extreme inflammatory remarks, Duterte said a law and order crackdown that particularly targeted drugs would be one of his top priorities when he became president, and he was prepared to kill. "I will do it (fight drugs), even if they say I am an executioner," said Duterte, who rights groups accuse of running vigilante death squads in Davao that have killed more than 1,000 people. "Look what I did to Davao. I will not let down the people." Duterte, who on the campaign trail boasted of being behind the death squads, also had a warning for corrupt police. "If you are a policeman and stick to your racket, choose: either you kill me or I kill you," he said.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The government has strongly contested Nepal government's report that disbursement of Official Development Assistance (ODA) by India to Nepal dipped by over 50 per cent in its last fiscal year (2014-15), allowing China to overtake India as an aid donor to the Himalayan nation. Nepal counted UK, US, Japan, China and Switzerland as its top 5 bilateral DPs (development partners) on the basis of disbursement, leaving out India from the list for the first time in past 5 years. Its finance ministry had said in its latest Development Cooperation Report that ODA disbursement by India plummeted from over $47 million to $22 million in 2014-15, MEA said Thursday that India continued to disburse aid worth over $50-70 million every year to Nepal. The ministry said that the figure of $22.227 million (India's disbursement to Nepal in 2014-15) was a misleading figure "which totally distorted the picture". "Actual funds released to assist Nepal from MEA's Aid-to-Nepal budget are in the range of Rs 300 to 400 crore annually, or over $50 to 70 million. The discrepancy could be because a good part of our Aid-to-Nepal is not necessarily routed through the Nepalese treasury," said spokesperson Vikas Swarup, adding India remained fully committed to Nepal's socio-economic development and that there was no aid cut. Nepal finance ministry report had said that "it is clear" that disbursement from World Bank, India, EU, Japan and India had declined from the level for FY 2010-11. It acknowledged though that both India and China have also provided technical assistance to it through scholarships, training and study tours, which is not fully reflected in the total volume of assistance. India has also committed $1,400 million for Nepal's earthquake reconstruction work as against China's $766 million. The government said that what was also not being counted was payment of pension to ex-Gorkha soldiers, which is about Rs1800 crore per year, or $300 million. "In addition, our 'Operation Maitri' after the earthquake in Nepal last year cost Rs 400 crore, or $70 million," said Swarup, adding that at the very minimum, India was spending $50-60 million to assist Nepal every year. Moreover, our initial allocations for foreign aid including Nepal and other neighbouring countries, are based on actual expenditure levels in the preceding years, and take into account absorption capacity of our valued partners. So more can and will be provided, if and when required," said the official. According to India, major payments include about 3,000 scholarships to Nepalese students annually and training for over 700 Nepalese people from security, economic and other organizations accounting for about 75 crore rupees. In addition, the government said, India had approximately 20 Small Development Projects in Nepal. Four Lines of Credit totalling $1.65 billion are available for utilization, of which only $150 million has been disbursed since 2010. Its interest equalization is borne by MEA. "We have gifted over 600 buses and ambulances, more than 1000 shallow tube wells and iodized salt which totals another 50 crore rupees. Add to this, construction of river training embankments for Rs 40 crore rupees; and payments for ongoing projects such as ICPs, Terai Roads and Rail links, depending upon project progress," said the official.</text>

"A strong protest was lodged at the unfortunate hanging of Mr Motiur Rahman Nizami on the alleged crimes committed before December 1971 through a flawed judicial process," Pakistan foreign office (FO) said in a statement. Bangladeshi envoy Nazmul Huda was on Thursday summoned to the foreign office a day after Pakistan issued a statement expressing sadness over the "unfortunate hanging" and National Assembly passed a resolution condemning the execution. The Pakistan FO stated that the 1974 Tripartite Agreement is the foundation of relations between the two countries. Hours later in Dhaka, Pakistan's high commissioner Shuja Alam was called at the FO where he was handed over a strong note verbale.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: India maintained a studied silence on political developments in Nepal on Monday, even as New Delhi conveyed its "displeasure" to Kathmandu over being dragged into what it believes is "externalising" a domestic debate. Regardless of how things pan out, the latest in a series of events have damaged PM Narendra Modi's big Nepal initiative of 2014. Nepal PM K P Oli has not covered himself with glory in the past year which saw bruising protests by Madhes groups in the Terai against discrimination in the Nepalese Constitution. Oli's relationship with India hit rock bottom, while he played the China "card" to display "independence" from New Delhi. As former envoy to Nepal, Rakesh Sood explains, "Oli has remained preoccupied with polarising politics. He has not reached out to other political forces  neither the NC nor UDMF. Governance is hampered, most visible in the absence of any progress on the much needed post- quake reconstruction. In addition, by playing the nationalist card, he has blamed India for all his problems, taking relations to new low." "The Nepal government is committed to resolving the political and Constitutional issues within the framework of the Constitution through dialogue and consensus," Oli said during his visit to India in February. On his first visit as PM, he said he "dedicated his visit to eliminating the misunderstanding" with India. Two months later, bilateral relations are strained again with his allegation about India interfering in Nepal's domestic affairs. Oli's government is safe for the time being, but Indian sources said Prachanda could mount another challenge some time later. Former foreign secretary and envoy to Nepal, Shyam Saran said this event was not unusual in Nepalese politics. "However, the propaganda against India is talking hold," he said. The question being asked is, what caused Prachanda to turn around and go back to supporting Oli? Some sources said while Prachanda had supposedly got support from the Madhesi parties, he may not have been confident of their support. But separately, it is believed the Chinese quietly stepped in and asked Prachanda to maintain stability of the government and Left unity. Between 2008 and 2012, Maoists teamed up with UML to provide four PMs in rotation, two from UML and two from UCPN (Maoist), so these two parties have a natural fit. But if the Chinese intervention actually happened, it would be one of those rare moments when China weighed in during a domestic political crisis.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina may visit India later this year. Whether this would be a standalone visit or part of the BIMSTEC summit in October is yet to be decided, but sources said Bangladesh is keen to have a reciprocal visit after PM Narendra Modi made his first trip to Dhaka in June 2015. Meanwhile, foreign secretary S Jaishankar will be in Dhaka on Wednesday to lay ground for the joint consultative commission meeting which will likely be attended by foreign minister Sushma Swaraj in July. Jaishankar's visit also comes after Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rehman Nizami was convicted of war crimes and executed, which has already seen heated exchanges between Dhaka and Islamabad. While India and Bangladesh are arguably at one of their best periods bilaterally, there is growing concern about the continued targeted killings by Islamist outfits - IS and al -Qaida. Post the land boundary agreement, with many of the new Indian citizens casting their votes for the first time in West Bengal polls, Dhaka now has eyes on Teesta water sharing pact. Moreover, there will be some discussions on starting a bus and train service between Khulna in Bangladesh and Kolkata. India has volunteered to develop Payra port in Bangladesh for which an Indian technical delegation is expected there soon. Shipping minister Nitin Gadkari will also visit to set the project in motion.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: As India and Nepal teetered on the brink of a full-scale diplomatic war, Nepal's ambassador to India Deep Upadhyay warned on Monday that some people in his country needed to acknowledge that it is with India, and not any other country, that Nepal has 'roti-beti ka rishta'. Without naming any Nepalese politician, Upadhyay told TOI that there were people in his country who kept talking about China without realising the significance of Nepal's "unique relationship" with India. Notwithstanding its own failings, the Indian government has been upset with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli for the manner in which he has sought to manipulate Delhi's insecurity over China's presence in the region, playing both ends against the middle. Nepal's agreements with China under Oli, including the path-breaking trade transit treaty, will take time to materialise though and, according to Indian authorities, Oli is now betraying his frustration by accusing India of plotting against him. "It's with India, and not with any other country, that we have a roti-beti ka rishta," said Upadhyay. "Given the geography, there's no other country from which the Nepal's economy can benefit more. And then we also have deep-rooted cultural links and people-to-people contacts with India. In fact, there are 1.36 lakh Indian armed forces' pensioners living even in our hills," said Upadhyay, who has stayed put in India, amid reports from Kathmandu that he had been recalled. The envoy said he had received no such communication from his government and that he remained in-charge. I'll wait to see what decision the government takes but I'm still the ambassador of Nepal to India,'' he said. Upadhyay was appointed ambassador to India by former PM Sushil Koirala of Nepali Congress, the main opposition party which came close to dislodging the Oli government last week by joining hands with Maoists led by Prachanda, a constituent of the ruling Left. Upadhyay sounded cautious while talking about his government's likely action as he said he appreciated the "mild language'' used by foreign minister Kapal Thapa when he spoke in Parliament on the issue on Saturday. Thapa had said in his speech that ties with India would not be impacted by the postponement of Bhandari's visit and that Upadhyay was not being recalled for his political background. Upadhyay admitted that he was against Nepal government's decision to cancel President Bidhya Devi Bhandari's visit to India at the "11th hour''. He said that couldn't be construed as acting against the interests of Nepal or as conspiring against the government led by Oli. While the Oli government has accused Upadhyay of accompanying his counterpart Ranjit Rae to the Terai region, the ambassador said the tour never took place and that in any case it was meant to promote tourism in Nepal.</text>

	<text>Jhansi: He may not have cut a mammoth hill like Dashrath Manjhi to clear the way for his fellow villagers in Bihar as a tribute to his wife, but this green crusader has helped plant over 30,000 trees in Chitrakoot of Bundelkhand region in Uttar Pradesh. After his wife died during labour in 2001, Bhaiyalal, 48, was desolate. In 2008, another tragedy struck him when his only son died at a tender age of seven and he lost all interest in life. But then the idea of working for the people occurred to him and he decided to bring barren lands back to life by planting saplings and nurturing trees. Since then, there has been no looking back for this environmental crusader of Bharatpur village in Chitrakoot. Bhaiyalal, who has been working as a contractual labour with the forest department, took part in a massive plantation drive launched in Bundelkhand in 2008. He specially chose barren lands coming under the forest department in Chitrakoot and helped in planting and nurturing around 30,000 trees. "I believe that forest should look like a forest and kept on planting trees," Bhaiyalal told TOI. Not only this, Bhaiyalal single-handedly watched over the 30,000 trees and saved them from the vagaries of nature or being eaten up by animals till they grew up. According to the reports of Forest Survey of India, 2015, there has been an increase of 11 sq km of green cover in this region since the plantation drive was launched in 2008. Bhaiyalal's love for trees made him leave his village and he moved into the jungle where the trees were planted and constructed a cottage for himself in the midst of the woods. "I wanted to feel these trees as they give me inspiration to live after I lost my family," he said philosophically. Today, after almost a decade, Bhaiyalal continues to live with his trees, nurturing them like his own. Bhaiyalal's work has even earned him a sobriquet of Bundelkhand's Dashrath Manjhi.</text>

	<text>In his latest work, The Gene, an Intimate History, Pulitzer-winning author and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee examines the role of heredity in our lives On October 6, 1942, five years before my father's family left Barisal, my mother was born twice in Delhi. Bulu, her identical twin, came before her, placid and beautiful. My mother, Tulu, emerged several minutes later, squirming and crying murderously. The midwife must, fortunately, have known enough about infants to recognize that the most beautiful are often the most damned: the quiet twin, on the edge of listlessness, was quite severely undernourished and had to be swaddled in blankets and revived. The first few days of my aunt's life were the most tenuous. She could not suckle at the breast, the story runs (perhaps apocryphally), and there were no infant bottles to be found in Delhi in the forties, so she was fed through a cotton wick dipped in milk, and then from the caul of a cowrie shell shaped like a spoon. A nurse was hired to tend to her. When the breast milk began to run dry at seven months, my mother was quickly weaned to let her sister have its last remnants. Right from the onset, then, my mother and her twin were living experiments in genetics  emphatically identical in nature and emphatically divergent in nurture. My mother  the "younger" of the two by minutes  was boisterous. She had a slippery, mercurial temper. She was carefree and fearless, fast to learn and willing to make mistakes. Bulu was physically timid. Her mind was more agile, her tongue sharper, her wit more lancing. Tulu was gregarious. She made friends easily. She was impervious to insults. Bulu was reserved and restrained, quieter and more brittle. Tulu liked theater and dancing. Bulu was a poet, a writer, a dreamer. Yet the contrasts only highlighted the similarities. Tulu and Bulu looked strikingly similar: they had the same freckled skin, almond-shaped face, and high cheekbones, unusual among Bengalis, and the slight downward tilt of the outer edge of the eye, the trick that Italian painters used to make Madonnas seem to exude a mysterious empathy. They shared the inner language that twins often share. They had jokes that only the other twin understood. Over the years, their lives drifted apart. Tulu married my father in 1965 (he had moved to Delhi three years earlier). It was an arranged marriage, but also a risky one. My father was a penniless immigrant in a new city, saddled with a domineering mother and a half-mad brother who lived at home. To my mother's overly genteel West Bengali relatives, my father's family was the very embodiment of East Bengali hickness: when his brothers sat down to lunch, they would pile their rice in mounds and punch volcanic holes in it for gravy, as if marking the insatiable, perpetual hunger of their village days in the form of craters on their plates. Bulu's marriage seemed a vastly safer prospect by comparison. In 1966, she was engaged to a young lawyer, the eldest son of a well-established clan in Calcutta. In 1967, Bulu married him and moved to his family's sprawling, decrepit mansion in South Calcutta, with a garden already choked by weeds. By the time I was born, in 1970, the sisters' fortunes had started to move in unexpected directions. In the late 1960s, Calcutta began its steady descent into hell. Its economy was fraying, its tenuous infrastructure heaving under the weight of waves of immigration. Internecine political movements broke out frequently, shuttering the streets and businesses for weeks. As the city convulsed between cycles of violence and apathy, Bulu's new family hemorrhaged its savings to keep itself afloat. Her husband kept up the pretense of a job, leaving home every morning with the requisite briefcase and tiffin box  but who needed a lawyer in a city without laws? Eventually, the family sold the mildewing house, and moved into a modest two-room flat  just a few miles from the house that had sheltered my grandmother on her first night in Calcutta. My father's fate, in contrast, mirrored that of his adoptive city. Delhi, the capital, was India's overnourished child. Bolstered by the nation's aspirations to build a mega-metropolis, fattened by subsidies and grants, its roads widened and its economy expanded. My father rose through the ranks of a Japanese multinational firm, clambering swiftly from lower-to upper-middle class. We vacationed in Europe. We learned to eat with chopsticks and swam in hotel pools in the summer. When the monsoons hit Calcutta, the mounds of garbage on the streets clogged the drains and turned the city into a vast infested swamp. One such stagnant pond, festering with mosquitoes, was deposited yearly outside Bulu's house. She called it her own "swimming pool." There is something in that comment  a lightness  that was symptomatic. You might imagine that the sharp vicissitudes of fortune had reshaped Tulu and Bulu in drastically different ways. On the contrary: over the years, their physical resemblance had dwindled to the point of vanishing, but something ineffable about them  an approach, a temperament  remained remarkably similar and even amplified in its convergence. Despite the growing economic rift between the two sisters, they shared an optimism about the world, a curiosity, a sense of humor, an equanimity that borders on nobility but comes with no pride. When we traveled abroad, my mother would bring home a collection of souvenirs for Bulua wooden toy from Belgium, fruit-flavored chewing gum from America that smelled of no earthly fruit, or a glass trinket from Switzerland. My aunt would read travel guides of the countries that we had visited. "I've been there too," she would say, arranging the souvenirs in a glass case, with no trace of bitterness in her voice. There is no word, or phrase, in the English language for that moment in a son's consciousness when he begins to understand his mother  not just superficially, but with the immersive clarity with which he understands himself. My experience of this moment, somewhere in the depths of my childhood, was perfectly dual: as I understood my mother, I also learned to understand her twin. I knew, with luminous certainty, when she would laugh, what made her feel slighted, what would animate her, or where her sympathies or affinities might lie. To see the world through the eyes of my mother was to also see it through the eyes of her twin, except, perhaps, with lenses tinted in slightly different colors. What had converged between my mother and her sister, I began to realize, was not personality but its tendency  its first derivative, to borrow a mathematical term. In calculus, the first derivative of a point is not its position in space, but its propensity to change its position; not where an object is, but how it moves in space and time. This shared quality, unfathomable to some, and yet self-evident to a four-year-old, was the lasting link between my mother and her twin. Tulu and Bulu were no longer recognizably identical  but they shared the first derivative of identity.

	<text>In the sixties, it was hard for a brown man to find a room to let, writes Farrukh Dhondy. Today, Asian fans are donning City's blue and white colours and cheering the club Tom Hanks, superstar, placed a ten pound bet some months ago on a football team called Leicester City. The bookies were at that time offering odds of 1 to 5,000 against them winning the Premier League title. Last week Hanks collected half a million pounds Sterling. The dust hasn't settled yet on Leicester City's unpredicted and spectacular victory. Writers, politicians and other Toms, not to mention Dicks and Harriets are now claiming to be the club's supporters. Julian Barnes, Booker-prize winning novelist, was given space on the front page of the Guardian newspaper to boast about his residence in Leicester and allegiance to the city's football team. Alistair Campbell, Tony Blair's notorious press handler and spin-doctor, wrote a piece saying he was present at the club's final game and was patronisingly pleased to see the spectator stands filled with Asian faces. I too once lived in Leicester. I was at the time writing a post-graduate thesis on Rudyard Kipling at Leicester University and before I enrolled I took the train up from London to find myself a room to live in. This was in 1968 and I did the obvious thing  I went to estate agents who sent me to houses where there were single rooms to let. I must have gone to three or four of these, rung the bell, only to be told that the accommodation had, unfortunately, just been let. Farrukh Dhondy After the third or fourth such rebuttal, I deduced that there was a possibility that the renters didn't like my face or race. I went back to the estate agent in something of a rage and placed my accusation against their clients in as respectful a way as I could. They said they couldn't help. As I walked out of the agent's office I was followed down the street by a secretary from the office. She had overheard the conversation and was sympathetic. She said the only advice she could give me was to go to the 'Asian area' of the city and look for notice boards advertising rooms to let. I asked her where these Asian areas were and she directed me to Narborough Road. I found such a notice board and after one or two phone calls found a room and put a deposit down. At the time the area was populated by Punjabis, mostly Indian and some Pakistani. It was the year of mass migration of Asians from Kenya and later, under the compulsion of Idi Amin's regime, from Uganda. For some reason, a large number of these immigrants, mostly of Gujarati origin, came to Leicester. Over the decades the city became one of the hubs of Asian migration and today it is a multiracial, multicultural city and has elected as its MP, one Keith Vaz, an Indian Christian. The city has, since I was there, changed in very many ways. It now boasts several theatres which put on serious and frivolous Asian entertainment. Highfields, one of the central areas of the city, with ageing Victorian housing stock was settled by mainly Pakistani immigrants. It used to be the red light district and in the eighties the Muslim community made a well-publicised and understandable move to clear the streets of sex-workers. The prostitutes formed a loose union and fought back, asserting the fact that they were there before the Asians came and besides a major part of their clientele was from the community that opposed them. The dispute was settled by a compromise  the girls wouldn't solicit on the streets. In the days when I was turned away on the doorstep while looking for a room, I would in London or Leicester stay away from the streets on the days when a football match was scheduled. British football fans were notorious for their rowdiness and racism and when moving about in gangs singing and shouting raucously were an intimidating lot. I wasn't anywhere near mobs of Leicester fans, known affectionately as 'Foxes', when they celebrated their victory but every TV channel and news report featured the events, outside the stadium and in the streets of the city. It was unusual to see so many Asian fans wearing Leicester's blue and white coloured shirts, shouting slogans, singing silly songs and wrapping themselves in Leicester city scarves. During Margaret Thatcher's Prime Ministership, her lieutenant, Norman Tebbit formulated what became known as the 'Tebbit test' for immigrants: when Britain was playing Pakistan, India or the West Indies at cricket, which team did the British immigrant support? Leicester City is unlikely to be pitted against an Indian or Pakistani football team in the near future, but if it is, its fans, all its fans, will, it's certain pass a modified Tebbit test as true Foxes. City Guide You know Leicester City won the Premier League against staggering odds. But there's more to the place than football First of all, it's 'Lester' not 'Lay-ces-ter' It has the highest number of British Indians in the UK  28.3% of the population of 3,29,000. No wonder, their Diwali celebrations are the biggest outside India Only 50.6% of the population identifies as white, according to the 2011 census It is home to the first Jain temple established in the West It is also home to David Atttenborough and his son Richard And it's the resting place of Richard III</text>

	<text>The revolutionary is fast turning into an urban pop culture icon with his face on everything from bags and bric-a-brac to mugs and mobile covers. Capitalism Zindabad! Ravi Shekhar, a 19-year-old undergrad at Delhi University with a swagger and sideburns, recently picked up some Bhagat Singh merchandise online  a screen-printed T-shirt and a backpack. Of course he knows who Singh is but no, he didn't know he was recently in the news. "What for?" he asks. "He was called a 'revolutionary terrorist'? Cool." About a week ago Shekhar's alma mater stopped the sale and distribution of the Hindi edition of historian Bipan Chandra's book India's Struggle for Independence, capitulating to ABVP protests over the book's references to Bhagat Singh as a revolutionary terrorist. Whether or not the rest of the country's 18-35-year-olds approve of, or even know of the disputed description, the protagonist himself has their unequivocal vote. For young hipsters, Singh is a desi daredevil, a rebel with a cause, a man of the hour. Literally. He gazes out from watches and wall clocks, but he's also on mugs, wallets, cushions, laptop skins, key-chains, lamps, mobile covers and even wall decals, bearing either of the two versions of his iconic image  turbaned or hatted. The more abstract art pictures him in fractals, or simply with the legend 'Shaheed' or 'Inquilab Zindabad' and a grim noose; some only feature a waxed moustache, shorthand like Gandhi's wire-rim glasses. The universe of Bhagat Singh merchandise on e-commerce sites has exploded in the last year or two, generating new product forms every month. "I come from Punjab, where Bhagat Singh is very popular, so I thought people elsewhere would love him too. I believe his rebelliousness appeals to young people," says Puneet Gupta, co-founder of the merchandise e-store Poster Guy, which retails goods printed with graphic art sourced from designers across the country. Their 'Bhagat Singh' range debuted around Independence Day last year. Raj Kiran Singh, 32, is banking on this home-grown hero-worship. The founder of the bobble and figurine company India Bobbles developed a 5-inch epoxy resin action figure, brandishing a pistol (presumably a stance from his storming of the Central Assembly). On the pedestal is the legend 'Purna Swaraj'. "Sales haven't been good," he admits, "Of the 250 figurines we produced, 100 are still unsold, but that's probably because we overpriced them at Rs 899." The entrepreneur hasn't given up  a bobble head of Bhagat Singh is next. Gupta hopes to build brand Bhagat. "People here wear Che Guevara, but they don't know him; he's just a fashion statement. We're trying to make Bhagat Singh the new Che for Indians." As with anti-capitalist Che, the irony of branding Marxist Bhagat is stark. The global journey of Argentine icon-turned-logo Che Guevara, from Cuban political symbolism (his image was first used by Castro in 1967), to student radicalism (by French student activists in 1968), to mute marketer of everything from condoms to kerchiefs, is a study in the protean power of the icon. Che's classic image was taken by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda in 1960 at a state funeral. Bhagat's famous hatted picture was shot on April 3 1929, at Ram Nath Photographers, at Kashmiri Gate, Delhi. It was meant to solidify his image as a secularist, and disseminated to the press after the April 8 assembly bombing. In India, Gandhi has always been the nation's default national icon  a mutable symbol of freedom, native industry, nationalism and non-violence  deployed by politicians of all stripes, socialists and capitalists hawking sentimentalism. While Bhagat Singh appears to have only recently crossed the threshold of urban pop culture. Professor Y S Alone, who teaches visual studies at JNU's School of Arts and Aesthetics, recalls post-Independence wall calendars that figured the 23-year-old, sometimes in the company of co-conspirators and fellow martyrs Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar. Though Gandhi didn't approve of their anarchy, he too was corralled into the calendars along with the triumvirate. "Post '95 Bhagat Singh returned to prominence because of his political appropriation by the BJP. The commoditisation of a hero is the consequence of his political appropriation," Alone goes on to say. After the Vajpayee government folded in 2004, Bhagat Singh was back on the shelf, only to be dusted down in 2014, when he was hailed as a 'desh bhakt' and 'virat purush' by the campaigning BJP. But do youth shoulder this 'virat purush' on their sleek slingbags as a symbol of patriotism, machismo or vague rebellion? "I hope the image means pride and resistance, but not empty nationalism," ventures Professor Aditya Mukherjee, co-author of the embattled Hindi reader, Bharat ka Swatantrata Sangharsh. "But resistance to what? For Bhagat Singh, it was resistance to imperialism and capitalism. We've seen Ram, who is supposed to be brave and truthful, being used to instigate communal killings. I shudder to think to what ends Bhagat Singh can be employed." Having said that, the academic would rather see Indian hipsters flaunt Singh than Elvis Presley. "It's a small but good step; it shows our youth can count Indian revolutionaries among their heroes, not just American celebrities." The Bhagat Singh you didn't know The only Bhagat Singh India knows is the anti-imperialist revolutionary, but few are aware he had a namesake on another continent. While one Bhagat fought to rid his country of a foreign hand, the other struggled to be naturalized in a foreign land. Bhagat Singh Thind was the older of the two by 15 years. He was born in Amritsar but travelled to America in 1913 to pursue higher studies. Five years later he was recruited by the US Army to fight in World War I, and was even promoted to acting sergeant. In 1918 he applied to the US government for citizenship, which technically only 'free white persons' and those of African descent could apply for. However, several high caste, light-skinned immigrants managed to bypass this because of their skin colour. Thind too was granted citizenship, but it was rescinded four days later. He made two more attempts  in 1923 the matter even reached the Supreme Court, which ruled against him  until his last attempt bore fruit in New York. This March, the Asian-American theatre group, East West Players, staged a play based on Bhagat Singh Thind in schools and libraries in LA. "Part of my fascination with Thind came from the fact that he actually does not occupy a place of prominence in the Indian diaspora," says Mayank Keshaviah, the playwright, "So I felt as if I were uncovering a hidden gem of a story."</text>

	<text>It is hard to understand the Indian obsession with new capital cities. Since Independence, five states have chosen to build capitals at unimaginable expense, hardship to farmers and at a colossal waste of material resource, energy and manpower. Nowhere in the world do countries build whole cities from scratch when all that is required is a place to conduct the affairs of government. Countries that were born out of the breakup of Yugoslavia merely moved their capitals to places that had a long history and enough space to accommodate government functions. Zagreb became the capital of Croatia, Sarajevo of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Slovakia, born out of Czechoslovakia in 1993, shifted its capital to the medieval town of Bratislava, while the Czech Republic retained Prague. The 2011 split of Sudan turned the county government of Juba into a national capital for South Sudan, without expense or fuss. If countries can accommodate their capitals within existing cities, why do Indian states insist on constructing new ones? After the division with Telangana, try asking a state like Andhra to adopt a small town or village for its administrative needs, and all hell will break loose. Chandigarh as the first, was understandable. Between Nehru and Le Corbusier, the city was not just a capital for Punjab, but an urban symbol for the new India. That the job was awarded to an artist, was part of the risk Nehru took in the hope that the product would be altogether original, and not conform to tried and tested formulas. Since then, Gandhinagar, and New Bhubaneshwar were drawn in the lazy repeat of Western planning models  endless stretches of forlorn buildings bathed in dust, but conceived on paper as English garden cities. The most recent such experiment at Naya Raipur, the new capital for Chhattisgarh, demonstrates outmoded planning ideas at a monumental scale. Built over 8,000 hectares that displaced over 40 villages, the bloated exercise of state expenditure and land grab  despite newer models of land pools  was a shameful criminal act. Sixty years after Chandigarh, shouldn't state governments be constructing models of thrift that demonstrate altogether new forms of governance? Yesterday Naya Raipur, today Amravati. The Andhra government has staked out its planned territorial intent right at the beginning, proposing secretariats, offices, housing and public structures in the most desirable locations. The undemocratic nature of this first stage of design is in sharp  and ironic  contrast to the entirely democratic and uncontrolled free-for-all when the city eventually opens its gates to migrants. Still, the gigantic effort is not without its problems. Besides agitation by angry farmers, missing land records and a site untested for long-term habitation, the cumbersome procedure that involved chief ministers, bureaucrats and foreign architects has quickly descended into farce. Ideals of planning have had to be realigned to suit ancient beliefs of vaastu; the foreigners were entirely unaware that structures in Andhra could not be approached from the north-east; at the insistence of the chief minister, a 'Kuchipudi' bridge will also be built on the river to reflect Andhra culture; the wholly traditional structure would ironically be designed by a Chinese firm. If the ridiculousness of multiple cultural and technical collaborations makes you laugh, the statistics of expense and logistics will make you cry. Twelve million people are expected to move into a city built on 218 square km of land at an expense of one trillion rupees. Because of the physical atrophy of most cities, their state of utter dereliction and despair, the Indian heart lives in perpetual hope that something new and shining, something wholly un-Indian, may still be possible. So the messages are always filled with stock phrases: sustainable eco-conscious design, green concept, mixed-use neighbourhood, people-friendly technology, solar energy, wind farms, smart-city, world class, iconic... How do you even begin to apply this cascade of borrowed and untested pretensions to vague, unmade places? What would it take to get India's new capitals to downsize? Can in fact state governments reconsider their standard call for elaborate structures  of the kind the Mughals and the British built  to places humbler? Sadly, in the seven states that have been added by subtraction into the Union, none has seen the capital as a potential for new ideas. Without an innovative model of the city, handing over large chunks of disputed land to foreign designers is the ultimate sign of hopelessness and despair. The author is a Delhi-based architect</text>

	<text>Movies to Mahabharata, he's analysed them all S Anand's passion for computing drove his Chemical Engineering professors to distraction at IIT Madras, and when he moved on to IIM Bangalore, after a brief stint at IBM India, he was nicknamed "Stud" and alternatively, "Prof"  which as any alumnus will tell you  is one of the highest forms of praise that can be given to a batchmate. After graduating from IIM B, Anand moved on to jobs at the Boston Consulting Group and Infosys Consulting. In 2012, he was infected by the startup virus, and became chief data scientist at Gramener, which specializes in data visualization. Anand lives in Bangalore, where he uses text analytics to uncover the fact that it is Yudhishthira who is at the centre of Mahabaratha's plot, and not Arjuna, as one would imagine. Oh, and he also uses data science to understand his mobile bill. On becoming a data scientist ... It was an accidental mix of three of my personal interests  programming, statistics and design. It wasn't until 2009 that the term "data science" was coined. Until then, I knew I wanted a career that combined all three of my passions. Once I knew it had a name, the decision was obvious. What's the kind of work you do at Gramener? We're short circuiting the gap between gathering data and understanding data. We're work with all kinds of data. We work with aircraft flight paths, call data, court case results, fielding performances, poll forecasts, TV serial transcripts, even sex survey responses. But across these domains and types of data, there are common patterns of problems. Which are the biggest problem areas? What factors drive performance? What is the expected outcome? Fortunately, we have also discovered common patterns of analysis and visuals that answer these. Our work involves applying these patterns to any and every dataset. Best thing about your job ... Stumbling on strange patterns that tell a story. For example, when we discovered that 88 people at Modakkuruchi, TN, stood for elections but didn't even vote for themselves, it was a shock. Or when we found that children born in August score much more than children born in July. Or that people taking meter readings don't always visit the premises and cook up numbers that are typically multiples of 10. There are usually several insights hidden in data. For us, it's like exploring Alibaba's cave of treasures. What tools do you use? We use Python (a programming language) for most of our analysis. It's easy to learn, and easy to explore data with. R and Julia are quite popular as well. But Excel remains the primary method for data exploration in most organisations, and is quite effective. However, the tool is often less important than the scientist. A good scientist with a paper and pen will beat a moderate scientist with the best tool available today. How do you use data in daily life? Several of my day-to-day decisions are data-driven. What to eat? I scrape price and calorie information to pick cheap energy-rich foods. What to watch? I visualise the top-rated popular movies by genre from IMDb. When to book a flight? I review flight price trends, and typically book exactly 8 days before the flight. In many ways, my becoming a data scientist was driven by these inclinations. It's not because I'm a data scientist that I do this. It's because I have always done this that I'm a data scientist today. (As told to Narayanan Krishnaswami) Numbers have a story to tell Somewhat like endurance biking, data science is about staying power and enjoying the ride. Little wonder that Raam Nayakar, who is senior manager of marketing analytics and strategy at fashion e-retailer Myntra, follows one as a passion and the other as a profession. Sometimes the twain do meet when the 37-year-old uses his data orientation to find petrol stations and eating joints on remote biking routes. Best thing about the job It's a dynamic field. Finding new ways to analyse data keeps me on my toes. For instance, I recently learnt Python, an open-source analysis system in demand these days. Data analysis sometimes results in counter-intuitive insights, which is very exciting for us. For example, we once told an American wholesale retailer's credit card program to invert their loyalty rewards system and reward low spenders instead of the higher ones. We had identified the highest spenders as mostly re-sellers who did not need to be incentivized. This saved the company millions of dollars. What makes a good data scientist? A data scientist has to have a business context. We should be able to look at numbers, understand what they are telling us, and how that message can be converted into an actionable form. A good data scientist needs to have an eye for detail as well as the big picture. A typical day at work One day I am trying to find which TV channels drive better traffic for Myntra; another day I am engaged in text mining to rank social media responses for a contest we ran. It's the diversity of business problems that keeps my work interesting. Applying data science in daily life When I came back to Bangalore after a few years of living abroad, I was overwhelmed by the traffic. It would take me an hour and fifteen minutes to reach the Hosur Road office from my residence in JP Nagar. In the first month, I tried multiple routes at different timings, assessed areas of traffic congestion, and road conditions. In other words, I analysed the traffic data to construct a route that now takes me less than 45 minutes. Being a data oriented person, I don't miss out on details. My skills help me optimize time and effort even when I am not working. For example, if you want to get good properties to stay during your trips abroad  find out from which country do most of the tourists come from. Then make your booking from a local travel site in that country. I got two nights in a private villa in Bali when I booked from an Australian tour agent site. At the time, Australia contributed over 25% of tourists to Bali. Now, China has overtaken Australia. Is it going to stay a hot job? Many startups are now offering data science incubators and boot camps to train an army of data miners. Business analytics training institutes are offering courses, as are some of the IIMs. Big data is going to get even bigger. (As told to Shobita Dhar)</text>

	<text>Even as India's first PM is scrubbed out from textbooks, his reputation is being savaged on the internet * Jawahar, the Arabic word for pearl, could not have been chosen by any Kashmiri Brahmin as a name for his child. * Jawaharlal Nehru's grandfather was Ghiasuddin Ghazi, a kotwal of the Mughals, who changed his name to Gangadhar Nehru. * Nehru was born in a brothel in Allahabad. * Nehru got a Catholic nun pregnant, and was indebted to the church for spiriting her away from India. He died of syphilis. * Amitabh Bachchan is his son. Welcome to the virtual world of Nehru vilification. Entirely unhinged from reality, these wild stories about India's first prime minister, who laid the foundations of its democracy, are nonetheless the default on the internet. Unlike the academic challenge of changing details in textbooks, the Web is a terrain for the taking. "Anything that questions dominant historical views is going to find visibility and virality online," says digital media scholar Nishant Shah. Crackpot stories about Nehru have circulated for decades - for instance, former RSS chief K S Sudarshan has claimed that Nehru killed Gandhi. But "these are voices that never made it to the mainstream. Now, because there is such a preponderance of them online, these rumours take on a life of their own," says Rohit Chopra, media studies professor at Santa Clara University, who works on online Hindutva. This is particularly problematic because for many people now, reality is what they can find through Google, he says. Nehru, of course, is highest on the list of hate objects for Hindutva extremists. "After Partition, and even more after Gandhi's murder, Nehru was convinced that India must not in any circumstances become a Hindu Pakistan. He saw the RSS as dangerous because of its demonising of minorities, and repeatedly and publicly attacked it," says historian Ramachandra Guha. And the RSS continues to attack him right back. The hegemony of his ideas, and the persistence of his bloodline are both intolerable to them. "Indira's, Rajiv's, Sanjay's, Sonia's and Rahul's mistakes (real or imagined) are retrospectively attached to Nehru," says Guha. On YouTube, a search for Nehru throws up smear after smear. The first, declaring him "Hindustan ka sabse ayyash aadmi", was watched 40,16,640 times at last count. These stories lay bare the campaign against him  Nehru must be cast as Muslim, westernised and dissolute, to discredit him. To establish him as a philanderer, there is a patchwork of images of Nehru at innocuous moments, with Jacqueline Kennedy and Mrinalini Sarabhai, embracing his sister at the airport, lighting a woman's cigarette. Last year, Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Centre for Internet and Society, caught sneaky edits to the Wikipedia entries of Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru, emanating from a central government IP address. Recently, a patently fake and misspelt "historical" letter did the rounds, where Nehru supposedly described Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal. The right wing has mastered the arts of seeding misinformation, says Shah. Their claims do not come from one author, but from many different users, each adding layers to the rumours. Then, he says, "It is a matter of faith through repetition, rather than truth through inquiry". While such conspiracy theories sprout all around the world, in India, they dominate search results, says Prakash. Apart from forums that rationally disagree with Nehruvian economics, foreign policy or defence, or make credible assertions about his positions, there are voices that simply slander Nehru. "Many kinds of right-wing animosities, economic, cultural and those that are reacting to the actions of the Nehru Gandhi family, come together in this attack," observes Prakash. These ideas have also taken root, to some extent. A startup employee unconnected to any political party recently set up a Twitter handle called Nehruvian, trying to counter such propaganda. He explains why he was stirred into action - "On a train to Lucknow, I was reading The Discovery of India, when a young man in his twenties asked me, "kyon padh rahe ho is chor ki kitaab?" And yet, there is no way to counter motivated rumours, short of undesirable censorship. Propaganda is a legitimate activity, and any rebuttal is also likely to be confined to its own echo chamber, Shah points out. Rather, what is needed is a new digital literacy, the "capacity to sift trustworthy information, to look critically at the sources they come from", says Prakash. As for Nehru, it may not be easy for textbook warriors of keyboard guerrillas to dislodge him. If after 52 years, there's still so much panic about his legacy, there must be something very durable about it."</text>

	<text>'Sexy chick' roles, pay disparities, discrimination against female directors... sexism runs deep in Hollywood. A non-profit production company, We Do It Together, seeks to change all that with more powerful roles for women both on and off screen. As a member of its advisory board, Freida Pinto is at the Cannes Film Festival to announce its first project. The actor tells Sumeet Keswani about the stereotypes she has encountered and how she fought them At a time when feminism has percolated to the grassroots, how has sexism sustained itself in the upper echelons of Hollywood? Art imitates life. And if you look at the world around, there's a very strong element of sexism ingrained among people, even the most educated groups. I was watching this TED talk on infidelity by Esther Perel and it was very interesting to learn how sexism was actually glorified eons ago. I don't want to sound like a cynic but it would be too high an expectation to think it can disappear suddenly. But it's definitely time to do something about it, to at least curtail the impact of it on women. How will the non-profit address sexism? What's the first project? Although we're a non-profit film production company, we're not here for charity. While we as individuals are not looking to make any money, the box office proceeds from each venture will feed the next. The idea is to produce something exciting and entertaining. We don't want to tell stories of puritan, chaste women, but women who are as real and powerful as men. It's not just the stories, but also who's making them. In 2002, 7% of directors were female. It's 2016 now, and that number still stands at 7%. We're looking at female-driven stories made by female directors. Our first project is going to be a compilation of six to seven short stories. Each of these is a project that a female director or producer wanted to make. These will be released together as a feature film or TV series. One of them is a story I've been working on for a long time. I'm going to be producing it and acting in it too. Have you done any roles that you now feel catered to stereotypes? I have done many roles that were stereotypical! When I started off, I would think, 'If I don't take up this offer, maybe I won't get anything else.' When I took up Day of the Falcon, I wasn't very sure about the character. When I read it on paper, I wanted to give it a stronger presence. In the end, I didn't entirely go with my gut instinct. I can't tell others what to do but I personally have now come to a place in my life where if I'm offered a role that may be construed as sexist or degrading to women, I refuse to do it. I have the responsibility and power to say no. Any roles you've refused? I was offered a stereotypical role of an Indian call centre employee who spoke in a very desi accent. It also had a very disrespectful reference to the 2012 gang rape in Delhi. I immediately threw up my hands and refused the role. Any recent female characters that you have loved? Last year, Room was one of the most phenomenal movies. It was nice to get an insight into the life of a woman who was traumatized and wasn't the perfect mother at times, and that's fine. You shouldn't make a lesser film by telling the story of a perfect woman. Cate Blanchett's character in Blue Jasmine and Alicia Vikander's in The Danish Girl were also good to see. In Bollywood, Deepika's performance in Piku was refreshing. I'm working with Richa Chadha on Love Sonia. She's done a fair amount of powerful roles. And Shefali Shah is out of this world! I loved Kangana in Queen; she was vulnerable, funny and empowered all at the same time. Women aren't black and white all the time, and shouldn't be portrayed so. Actors like Cameron Diaz, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Olivia Wilde have brought up the issue of ageism in Hollywood. Your take on it? The issue very much exists. There's a disparity in the way men and women are viewed. For instance, Tom Cruise can be in his 50s and still be Ethan Hunt and romance 22-year-olds on screen. But when female actors hit 35 or 37, or god forbid the 40-mark, they are relegated to playing mothers or grandmothers  older characters who aren't sexually active anymore... all the female body parts suddenly disappear! We're still here, the same people having the same kind of fun men like to have. Female actors seem to have a shelf life in the industry. I personally feel that in my 30s, I'm more aware of who I am than I was in my 20s. Doesn't it mean I should get better roles now? But that's not the case. We want to address this issue by coming up with amazing stories of women well into their 40s, 50s, and 60s. They can be very entertaining as well. Has the issue of whitewashing affected you? Does your ethnicity dictate roles? From the very onset of my career, my team pushed out the message, 'Yes, she's Indian, but she's not interested in playing Indian roles only, especially not the stereotypical ones.' So I haven't faced that issue. As far as whitewashing goes, TV is way ahead of films in diversity. There's also a problem with the way Asian actors are cast. Filmmakers shouldn't add a token Indian girl for the sake of diversity; give her something real to do.</text>

	<text>You can see them in almost every village in drought-hit Marathwada  people, especially women and children, walking miles to fetch a single pot of water. But tiny Patoda, on the fringes of water-starved Aurangabad city, is different. It is surrounded by arid villages but people here just go to the water ATM nearby to get their share of potable water. Patoda's residents have learnt a valuable lesson  that water is more precious than money. They follow strict rules about usage and water audits are stringent. Households have water meters and the entire village recycles every drop of waste water it generates. So effective is its water conservation model that Patoda has now become a model for the rest of Marathwada. "It didn't happen overnight. We have been working for the last 10-12 years to ensure that every raindrop is saved and no water, not even waste, flows out of our village. The water balance sheet you see today is the result of strict discipline," says Bhaskar Pere-Patil, who developed the water model which has won 22 state and national awards. "The drought in Marathwada is man-made. People have failed to make efficient use of available water or recycle it. If Israel can perform miracles in its arid land, why can't we?" Pere-Patil asks. Patoda's story is the stuff film scripts are made of. It used to be a filthy village that suffered perennial water shortage. Pere-Patil, who has only studied till Class VII, was once a local hooligan who terrorized villagers into voting for him as sarpanch. In the years when he headed the village, he did nothing for it. Then one day, 10 years ago, Pere-Patil happened to overhear villagers talking about him. "I was shocked to learn that people saw me as some kind of a wild animal. I realized that they showed me deference only because I had money and muscle. I would earn their respect only if I did something for them," says Pere-Patil. Not only did he decide to change himself, but he also set about driving change in the village. His first initiative was to stop open defecation. Then came the troubling issue of water. "Initially, we went along only because we were afraid of him. But after some time, we realized that he is genuinely trying to change himself and the village," say the women. They soon joined his mission. The Kham River, which flows past the village, had been reduced to a nullah with unchecked release of sewage and effluents. The wells had no potable water and the government water supply scheme was neither enough nor potable. "We were forced to look elsewhere for a solution. We could not generate water, but we could certainly conserve what we get. The first step was saving rainwater by building several bunds across the nullahs. Today, no rain water flows out of our village. Percolation has recharged the aquifers and the water table has risen," says Pere-Patil. Once water was available in village wells, the gram panchayat decided to set up a water filtration plant on its own. Then came the concept of a water meter and ATM machine. Though there were government funds for various schemes the core contribution came from the villagers. Today, the gram panchayat provides 20 litres of filtered mineral water free to all the 581 families that use ATM cards. The machine operates 24x7 through the year. "It will never be empty. We have deposited all our effort in it," says youngster Ravindra Jadhav as he inserts a card into the slot to draw 20 litres of water. Additional filtered water is available through metered water supply at Rs 5 per 1,000 litres. Water from the government supply scheme and some wells is used for washing and cleaning. How they did it: * Bunds built to save rain water * Stabilisation ponds set up. Here, multiple forms of bacteria and algae act together to clean waste water which is then used for farming ? Water meters installed to curb use</text>

	<text>l Jan 21, 2015: Gangster Sukha Kahlon is gunned down in Phagwara by a rival gang. The killers dance around his bloodied body, shoot a video and post it online. On the Facebook page of Kahlon, who was facing 40 criminal cases, RIP messages pour in and many swear revenge. l Feb 20, 2016: Ravi Khwajke, a sarpanch, is shot dead at a marriage function in Ludhiana. Notorious hitman Davinder Bambiha takes 'credit' for the murder on his FB page, gets over 500 'likes'. l April 30, 2016: Gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky is shot dead near Parwanoo in Himachal triggering an online war among criminals to hog credit. Welcome to the ganglands of Punjab where rival gangsters are not only bumping off each other on the streets but also boasting about their crimes on social media while projecting themselves as modern-day Robin Hoods. Many of these bandolier-sporting and gun-toting gangsters call themselves 'Lions of Punjab'; some have pictures of Khalistani icon Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as their FB cover photo. For them, a murder is not complete until they take responsibility for it online for all to know and 'like'. Last month when gangster-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky, who faced multiple criminal cases and had contested the 2012 Punjab assembly elections from Fazilka and almost won, was slain near Parwanoo, it sparked off hectic online activity among criminals. A day later, gangster Jai Pal, an ex-cop's son from Ferozepur who is on the run, posted that he was the one who had actually killed Rocky, a claim the cops are taking seriously given his crime record. The same day friends and followers of Rocky created 'RIP Jaswinder Singh Rocky'  thousands posted messages on the page, calling Rocky a 'legendary man' and swearing revenge. Many of the gang-related murders in the last four years were instigated on Facebook  the killers boasted about their deed and humiliated rivals by posting messages on the pages of their victims. The hate messages are not removed by gangs and continue to feed their hatred for years. The celebratory video clip made by Kahlon's killers went viral last year. Even those in high-security jails across Punjab have been updating their FB accounts, taking credit for various crimes. But prison officials insist these are being operated by their supporters outside. ADGP (Prisons) M K Tiwari says, "We raided three jails after the killing of gangster Rocky but did not recover any SIM or phone, including in Nabha Jail, where gangster Vicky Gounder, who claimed responsibility for Rocky's killing, is lodged." Rajesh Gill, professor of sociology at Panjab University, says it's a worrying trend. "Some youngsters continue to eulogize militancy and believe that guns and violence are the easiest and shortest way to fame. This is also reflected in popular Punjabi songs, which are all about guns and killings," he says. Incidentally, the Punjabi Sahit Akademi had recently passed a resolution against Punjabi songs that glorify gun culture, saying such songs brainwash youngsters into believing there is pride and glory in crime. Gangsters also post messages of courage and fearlessness on their pages, portraying themselves as brave do-gooders on the wrong side of the law. Jitender Mohan, professor emeritus of psychology, Panjab University, says 'showing off' and bragging are part of Punjabi culture. "These gangsters are also desperate attention seekers and have found that the easiest way to fame, rather infamy, is through guns and false bravado," says Mohan. Is there no stopping them? According to IGP (cyber crime) P K Sinha, the cyber cell has been tracking the activities of gangsters online and action will be taken soon. "We are in the process of approaching Facebook headquarters in California through MHA to request them to disable some of the accounts. We are also exploring legal ways under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which authorizes law enforcement agencies to act against people using the internet against the sovereignty of the state," he adds. In the meantime, the gangs seem to be plotting their next hit. A day after Rocky's murder in Himachal, gangster Jaipal sent a chilling warning to rival gangs and cops in a message on FB: "The game has just begun. Just Wait and Watch." (With inputs from Vaivasvat Venkat in Ludhiana) Online lives of dead gangsters Shera Khuban: Headed the Gounder gang and was killed by Punjab police in Sept 2012, allegedly on a tipoff from Rocky's gang members. His FB account continues to be operational and posts are updated regularly. The FB page of Gounder gang has over 5,000 likes and members post important and frequent updates here Happy Deora: A close pal of gangster Jai Pal and later Rocky, Happy was killed allegedly by Shera Khuban in July 2012.

	<text>Are the rising swine flu casualties giving you jitters? Not sure how you can avoid falling prey to the growing epidemic? First and foremost, there is absolutely no need to panic. Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind, including swine flu. It is not necessary to follow all the steps at once. You can pick and choose a combination of remedies that suit you best. However, if you are already suffering from flu, these measures can help only up to an extent. 1. Have five duly washed leaves of Tulsi (known as Basil in English; medicinal name Ocimum sanctum) everyday in the morning. Tulsi has a large number of therapeutic properties. It keeps throat and lungs clear and helps in infections by way of strengthening your immunity. 2. Giloi (medicinal name Tinospora cordifolia) is a commonly available plant in many areas. Take a one-foot long branch of giloi, add five to six leaves of Tulsi and boil in water for 15-20 minutes or long enough to allow the water to extract its properties. Add black pepper and sendha (salt used during religious fasts), rock or black salt, or Misri (crystalised sugar like lumps to make it sweet) according to taste. Let it cool a bit and drink this kadha (concoction) while still warm. It will work wonders for your immunity. If giloi plant is not available, get processed giloi powder from Hamdard or others, and concoct a similar drink once a day. 3. A small piece of camphor (kapoor) approximately the size of a tablet should be taken once or twice a month. It can be swallowed with water by adults while children can take it along with mashed potatoes or banana because they will find it difficult to have it without any aides. Please remember camphor is not to be taken everyday, but only once each season, or once a month. 4. Those who can take garlic, must have two pods of raw garlic first thing in the morning. To be swallowed daily with lukewarm water. Garlic too strengthens immunity like the earlier measures mentioned. 5. Those not allergic to milk, must take a glass of hot or lukewarm milk every night with a small measure of haldi (turmeric). 6. Aloe vera (gwarpatha) too is a commonly available plant. Its thick and long, cactus-like leaves have an odourless gel. A teaspoon gel taken with water daily can work wonders for not only your skin and joint pains, but also boost immunity. 7. Take homeopathic medicines  Pyrogenium 200 and Inflenzium 200 in particular  five tablets three times a day, or two-three drops three times a day. While these are not specifically targeted at H1N1 either, these work well as preventive against common flu virus. 8. Do Pranayam daily (preferably under guidance if you are already not initiated into it) and go for morning jog/walk regularly to keep your throat and lungs in good condition and body in fine fettle. Even in small measures, it will work wonders for your body's resistance against all such diseases which attack the nose, throat and lungs, besides keeping you fit. 9. Have citrus fruits, particularly Vitamin C rich Amla (Indian gooseberry) juice. Since fresh Amla is not yet available in the market (not for another three to four months), it is not a bad idea to buy packaged Amla juice which is commonly available nowadays. 10. Last but not the least, wash your hands frequently every day with soap and warm water for 15-20 seconds; especially before meals, or each time after touching a surface that you suspect could be contaminated with flu virus such as a door handle or a knob/handle, especially if you have returned from a public place or used public transport. Alcohol-based hand cleaners should be kept handy at all times and used until you can get soap and warm water.

	<Heading>Synthetic bedding 'can cause asthma'</Heading>

	<text>NEW YORK: Are you prone to asthma? Then avoid synthetic bedding, for a new study has claimed that it can aggravate asthma more than feather products as it contains high levels of fungal cells. An international team has found that synthetic bedding contains much higher levels of fungi related beta glucan than feather bedding, which are non-allergenic components from the cell walls of fungi that can account for up to 60 per cent of the weight of the cell. "This study adds further strong evidence that feather bedding is better than synthetics if you have asthma. This is because beta glucan is pro-inflammatory and associated with lung function changes including peak flow variability in kids. "There have already been a number of international studies that show synthetic bedding is associated with more asthma symptoms compared to feather bedding," lead researcher Rob Siebers of Otago University said. For their study, the researchers looked at 178 samples obtained from 35 floors, 35 mattresses, 35 duvets, 73 pillows. The total beta glucan levels of synthetic pillows were two to three times higher than from feather pillows.</text>

	<text>NEW DELHI: With an aim to launch vaccine for Influenza H1N1 A Virus (swine flu) in India, Cadila Pharmaceutical will seek the government's nod in two days for initiating clinical trials in this regard. Cadila Pharmaceutical Ltd (CPL) had set up a joint venture 'CPL Biologicals Pvt Ltd' with the US-based vaccine maker Novavax for manufacturing and developing a host of vaccines, including for swine flu, in India. "The joint venture is going to file the application with the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in the next two days for phase-I clinical trials for swine flu vaccine," CPL Chairman and Managing Director I A Modi said. Modi expressed confidence that Cadila would be the first Indian pharma company to launch the swine flu vaccine in India by December. "If we get the permission of DCGI soon, then with the advanced technology available from our partner, (we) would be able to launch it in India by December this year," Modi said. With its existing facility, Cipla can produce up to one million doses of the vaccine per month, which can be scaled up to two million doses, Modi said. "Novavax has already received permission for clinical trials from the US Federal Drug Administration and if we get it soon, we can simultaneously start the trials," he added. The government has already indicated that swine flu related applications it would clear on a fast track basis and the company is hopeful of getting instant approval for it, Modi added. He said to protect from swine flu pandemic, two dosages of the vaccine are required over two weeks. The JV has already started building a facility with an estimated investment of Rs 100 crore. In the joint venture Cadila has 80 per cent stake and the remaining 20 per cent is held by Novavax. Besides this, Cadila Pharma also holds 5.75 per cent stake in Novavax Inc US and has a position on the board of directors of the US-based company.</text>

	<Heading>Breast cancer cases surge as cervical dips</Heading>
	<time_cap>| TNN | Aug 6, 2009, 12.50 AM IST</time_cap>

	<text>NEW DELHI: The good news: fewer women in India now suffer from cervical cancer - counted among the worst of killers. The bad news: breast cancer cases have shot up alarmingly, across the country. A landmark analysis of cancer cases in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore between 1982-2005 (24 years) by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that while cervical cancer cases dipped, in some cases by almost 50%, the incidence of breast cancer doubled. And, the trends contained in ICMR's yet-to-be-released report `Time Trends in Cancer Incidence Rates (1982-2005)', were universal in all four cities. In case of cervical cancer, this is how the cases have dropped: In 1982, Bangalore reported 32.4 new cases of cervical cancer in women per 100,000 population every year. The number dipped to 27.2 in 1991, 17 in 2001 and 18.2 in 2005. Delhi, whose records are available from 1988, saw 25.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population the same year. It then dipped to 19.1 in 1998 and then to 18.9 in 2005. Mumbai, which recorded 17.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population in 1982, recorded 12.7 new cases in 2005. Chennai recorded a fall of almost 50% in cases of cervical cancer in this period of 24 years. In 1982, Chennai recorded 41 cases per 100,000 population; nearly a decade later, in 1991, Chennai's figure of new cases dipped to 33.4. In 2005, new cases fell further to 22 per 100,000 population. Caused by the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), cervical cancer is often called the poor woman's disease. It was earlier believed that cervical cancer was most common in India, with more than 1.3 lakh new cases reported each year and 74,000 women dying annually from the disease. While Bangalore saw breast cancer cases more than double since 1982 - 15.8 in a population of one lakh in 1982 to 32.2 in 2005 - Chennai recorded 33.5 new cases of breast cancer in 2005 against 18.4 in 1982. Delhi recorded 24.8 new cases of breast cancer a year per 100,000 women which rose to 32.2 in 2005. Mumbai recorded 20.8 new cases of breast cancer per 100,000 population in 1982 which increased by almost 10% in 2005. ICMR director general and secretary of the department of health research Dr V M Katoch told TOI, ``The decline in cases of cancer cervix has been seen across all cancer registries. Factors like late age of marriage and fewer children could be responsible for the decline.'' Chief of medical oncology at AIIMS and head of the Delhi Cancer Registry Dr Vinod Raina told TOI, ``Increasing number of women are now delivering in institutions which has greatly improved their personal hygiene. Women now marry late and give birth to fewer children, all of which have led to a dip in cervical cancer cases.'' Ironically, these are the same factors, according to Dr Raina, which has increased breast cancer rates in India. ``Western lifestyle, increased consumption of fat products, obesity, late marriages, delayed child bearing and less number of children being conceived leading to reduced breastfeeding and use of some contraceptives, are all believed to be behind this increased risk of breast cancer. This cancer is also inevitable with an ageing population,'' he added. Dr Raina, however, was quick to say that breast cancer rate in India was much less than that in the West which records around 100 new cases per 100,000 population every year. According to Dr Katoch, the report depicts changes in the incidence rates of cancer and is the first for any chronic disease in India. Certain anatomical sites of cancer have shown a significantly steady increase across all registries, breast cancer being one of them. ``This data will now help galvanize India's health system and tell us how we can improve diagnostic capabilities and specialists in some types of cancer affecting Indians most,'' Dr Katoch said.</text>

	<text>Alexandre de Juniac, chairman and CEO of Air France-KLM, which on June 24 launched a 500 million aircraft upgrade project called BEST AND BEYOND with the inaugural flight of an advanced Boeing 777 on the Paris-New York route, says flyers from India can look forward to top-of-the-line seats by the end of 2016. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI's Surendra Singh: India being one of the largest economies in Asia, what are the new services Air France-KLM is planning to start in the country? Air France-KLM operates 20 weekly flights from India to Paris and 14 weekly flights from India to Amsterdam. We will launch upgraded B777 with top-class seats both for the business and economy classes in India by 2016. Our A330 fleet, which majorly caters to India, will also be upgraded by the end of 2016. Will you extend your business class promotional fares for Europe/UK tours for Indian flyers. Are you going to come up with more such attractive offers? Yes, we will. We will certainly come up with new offers. By the way, we are the only airline in the world to provide free champagne to our customers in all classes. Like the code share pact with Jet Airways, is AF-KLM planning any such partnership with domestic carriers? No plan at the moment. However, the code sharing pact with Jet Airways enabling flyers of both airlines seamless travel across destinations is working very well. Alexandre de Juniac. Will you elaborate on La Premiere segment? When are you going to launch the luxury cabins in Asia, particularly in India? La Premiere, ultra modern cabin with 4 suites in Boeing 777, will provide flyers home comfort in the air. A fully flatted bed, 24-inch high definition TV screen, personal wardrobe, hi-tech entertainment system and cabin with curtains will provide flyers a feel of 'cocoon in the sky'. Top-of-the-line cutlery, woven fabrics, cushions, adjustable curtains have been given a French touch. Flyers will get an escort to and from plane. Initially, 19 Boeing 777s are being equipped with La Premiere and the first aircraft will be launched on the Shanghai route in September. If the demand for the La Premiere increases, we will launch the product in India. Is it justified for AF-KLM Martinair Cargo to drop Delhi, the national capital, as a destination for full freighter operations? We have shrunk full freighter operations as our passenger aircraft are carrying 80% of the cargo load in their belly. Moreover, our new aircraft are coming with bigger bellies and can take extra load. It's cost-effective. How seriously are you taking competition with Gulf and Chinese carriers? Gulf carriers are eating into the Indian aviation market. The upgrade plan is to provide top-class product to our customers and give a tough competition to Gulf airlines. At the same time, we have an agreement with Etihad in order to understand and capture the market in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Seychelles. What target have you set for annual passenger capacity? Our annual passenger capacity is nearly 80 million. We haven't set our target but with better service and upgrade, we expect our annual passenger capacity will only grow. Why have you changed the slogan from 'Making the sky the best place on earth' to 'Air France, France in the air'. We want our customers to get a feel of France in the air. Service with a French touch. Air France-KLM is undergoing transformation. By 2017, we plan to invest 1 billion in our fleet in order to become a global player.

	<text>The Centre will push for key reforms including the provision of incentivising civic agencies for good work &amp; making officials concerned accountable for illegal construction or unauthorized development under their jurisdiction. In an interview to TOI's Dipak Kumar Dash, urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu said civic bodies agencies that fail to implement the master plan provisions won't get financial help from the ministry. Excerpts: The government plans to develop 100 new cities and UD ministry going to circulate a Cabinet note. What are the focus areas? We never said new cities, but 100 smart cities. Now the issue is whether you make the present cities smart or set up new cities or take up satellite cities and convert them or join two small towns and make it a city and provide them all facilities. That is under discussion. I have called a meeting of all state urban development and housing ministers on July 2 and July 3. This is because states have to play bigger role. We will take their suggestions on this and other issues. You must understand that cities cannot survive without lives. What is life? Life is education, entertainment, employment and health facilities. All these should be available. Then you need to provide water, urban transport, drinking water, have solid waste management, wi-fi facilities and GIS-based planning. All these facilities will be available in the smart cities. I am willing to take help of other countries including Australia and Singapore or whether it's Japan, Dubai or UAE. One of the major problems in cities is the civic mess, which impacts quality of living, air quality and everything. How is the government planning to address this? That's part of the reform we are talking about. There has to be certain amount of accountability of civic agencies. We are trying to incentivize agencies that do good work and are taking states on the board. There is a serious problem of devolution of 3Fs - funds, functions and functionaries. The local bodies are saying that they are yet to be given power that was provisioned in the 73rd and 74th amendment of the Constitution. After doing the devolution of 3Fs, we have to provide them technical help - one by states second by centre. And then also incentivize them by means of coming out with reforms. Then it will be successful. The taxpayers are unhappy as the areas surrounding residential colonies are being encroached and big illegal colonies have come up. I have put an idea before the officials and Delhi MPs. I will put it before the state ministers too. You allow unauthorized colonies for years. One day you bring bulldozer to demolish them. Then comes councillor, MLA, minister and the number gets bigger. You are not able to do anything. To deal with this the town planner, inspector or whoever is in-charge of that area must be made accountable. If we start taking action, people will be extra cautious. That's going to be my thrust area. This will be a part of the reforms that we are planning. If you don't act to implement the Master Plan, you don't get financial help from Centre.</text>

	<Heading>People look at fairy tales in a limited way: Hudson Asia MD Tulika Tripathi</Heading>

	<text>Tulika Tripathi is the managing director of a global talents solutions company, Hudson Asia. She spoke to TOI about her first book, Alice in Corporate Land, a book on career success, and more. Excerpts: Q: There are hundreds of books on corporate culture and success. What is unique about your book, Alice in Corporate Land? A: I am a voracious reader. When reading fiction, I can put myself in the place of the main character. I really enjoy the experience. Most books on career management are written as non-fiction. They give advice to the author. This makes the reader passive. Alice in Corporate Land is in the form of a fairy tale. The reader can accompany Alice on her journey and learn lesson themselves rather than having the writer telling them what to do. As a book, it's light and entertaining. Work is also about fun and this book allows the reader to learn the career lessons while being entertained. It also uses analogies of fairy tales with which the reader can relate. Q: What inspired you to write this book based on a fairy tale? A: Strangely a mixture of a few things. A couple of years ago retelling of fairly tales became quite popular. Retold versions of Snow White and Cinderella and movies like Once Upon A Time came out. It became quite a popular genre. At the High Potential Leadership Programme at Harvard Business School last year, I read a retelling of Cinderella. While walking back from a bar with a colleague, he asked me, why I was reading that book on fairy tales. I said it made me feel young and gives a perspective that things are possible. The idea that people look at fairy tales in a limited way stuck in my mind. I also wanted to leave some kind of advice for teams I had developed over the years. The writing fell into place and grew as a piece of fiction which is actually a business book. Q: Do you believe that small changes in one's life can make a difference? A: Big changes are actually a series of small changes. Small changes have knock on effects like the ripple effects and lead to very large outcomes. Most things that have made me successful, and probably would make me successful in the future, are not the big decisions that I make but the small things that I did. Making small changes in detail give maximum results. At the moment, the bigger decision I made with my general managers is instead of thinking why I can't do it, thinking of how I can do it. It's more of thinking how I can make that change rather than wondering why I can't make that change. Q: Why did you decide to use fairy tales to bring out different skills/lessons people can learn and use? A: People can relate to them. As children, we read fairy tales. Girls read fairytale books more than boys. Fairy tales play a role in women's psyche and life like thinking of one's Prince Charming. The stories in fairly tales can be interpreted in different ways. Q: What advice would you give someone just starting a career? A: The biggest advice I would give someone starting their career especially out of B school is when you start a career you might not be doing the most interesting thing. You might find it mundane and boring but put your CEO hat on. Think like you are the CEO. How can you add value to this job you have? Try to think as how you will approach it in a different manner. For example, at my first week for my job, I had to photocopy confidential papers. I cried the first and second day. The third day, I said to myself, I am stuck in this photocopy room so let me just read the confidential documents. Through reading these documents I learned telecom communication. Remember, it's not a race but a marathon. One needs to develop all muscles to go all the way. Build your work ethic. Be proactive and volunteer for tasks. Other people always like to have people who can do their job. Q: What was your favourite fairy tale as a child? A: My favourite fairy tale as a child was Cinderella. It's a classic story. It talks about overcoming adversity and having a happy ending. This concept fascinates me. Q: Are you planning to write another book? A: I have already started another book. It's in the initial stages. I will be talking in depth about the leadership challenges that one faces. Leadership is a complicated concept. The book that I am currently working on is not really a sequel to my book, Alice in Corporate Land. I have two directions in mind on how to write this book. One will be to continue using Alice as a main character and the other using a character named Tobi.</text>

	<text>The responsibility of lighting up the country today rests on Piyush Goyal's shoulders. Just a month into his new job, the minister for power, coal and renewable energy has set an electric pace to energize the sector. He shares his vision with TOI in a freewheeling interview with Sanjay Dutta. When can we expect 24X7 power supply or blackouts in hinterland to get shorter? Clearly, customer is the king. And that has been my first message to the departments under me. My effort is that we become a far more responsive government both to the needs and problems of the customer. When I say customer, the last man on the street is the final customer. But then within the system the power generator is the customer of the coal ministry or the coal supplier. The distributor is the customer of the power producer and then likewise in the entire chain. I am trying to get that responsiveness into the system that the coal people give the best service which means quality price, timely delivery to the generator. Generator ensures timely supplies which will also include transmission and distribution, being adequately provided so the generator can satisfy his customer which is the distribution company. The distribution company focuses to reduce power theft, to make sure 100% metering is done, he gets conscious of the fact that he has to ensure 24X7 power to each consumer and ultimately the consumer has to be educated that he has to pay for that power. He has to pay for that uninterrupted power for making it uninterrupted there will be certain redundancies built into the system. Also he will have to ensure that the theft that happens in the neighbourhood is stopped by a joint effort. After all, policing alone cannot stop every problem. It's the people's movement that resolves more problems than policing. And finally, we will all in this value have to be conscious that the things are done transparently so that corruption costs are not loaded on to the final consumer and the final consumer gets quality at the right price. We cannot have a system that everything can be passed on to the final consumer in the garb of cost being recovered without being sensitive to their own problems and affordability. The PM has spoken about the need for hard decisions, given the tight economic situation. As the doctor in charge of power, coal and renewable energy ministries, what are the bitter pills you will administer? I think one of the urgent issues to address is increasing the domestic coal production so that the capacity that is available in India is put to full use. One way to recover the cost can be that you pass it on to the consumer. But I would rather focus my energies to reduce the cost by improving efficiency, improving productivity, by ensuring that every plant runs to full capacity, by ensuring that adequate coal is mined in the country so that we don't pay for expensive imported coal. I have to bring in efficiencies in terms of linkages. You will be amazed that the country has a situation where departments work in silos, so we have coal which is imported into Gujarat for a power plant in Korba, run by NTPC. And Coal India has given linkage to a power plant of the Gujarat government from Korba. The train may be crossing the line at the same time, going up and down. Rejigging this could save Rs 400-500 crore and the benefit will pass on to the consumer. It will also unclog the over burdened railway network. Help me push out more coal from the mines to its final destination. I have initiated a study at the pan-India level, my gut feeling says that thousands of crore can be saved, millions of tonnes can be additionally transported through the system, and pollution can come down. Ramifications of small decisions can be pretty large. There have been complaints that you get a lot of boulders in coal. I am trying to see what I can do; planning to get crushers (it's not an expensive proposition). I have given a timeline that by December 31, 2014 I am hoping that the Coal India board takes quick decisions and action so that every piece of coal that goes out of the Coal India mine will be to international standards. Similarly, coal washing is an environmental friendly step, which for years has been quite neglected. I have passed orders that by June 2015- June 2016, which are the deadlines set by the environment ministry for a certain level of washing to be done, it will be strictly implemented and won't seek any further extension to that. It will entail some investment and washeries, but I think there can be no better service to the nation than ensuring that we are not transporting ash over long distances. Coal India has no dearth of money ... Its sitting on a pile of Rs 60,000 crore? It's not only about having cash in the books, it's also about improving our own efficiency. I would rather put that cash to good use to open new mines, expand the mining capacity. Again, something that needs people's participation. I, on my side, can assure that whoever may get displaced whenever a new mine is opened, or a forest might have some mining activity, since mining activities are in forests, I can give categorical assurance that they will be well looked after, the R&amp;R (relief and rehabilitation) will be better than the law provides. I can assure that I will use every effort to recreate afforestation to expand the forest cover. But we will need people's support to open new mines, to mine larger quantities. Today, we have certain decisions in certain states which are holding back mining production. A particular state says that you cannot move trucks from one time to the other. And if I cannot move trucks for 14 hours in a day then the mine's production is down to 40%. So, it ultimately affects power generation and then the consumer. I will need a lot of support from all the stakeholders the states, consumers, environmentalists, everybody. I want to reach out to everyone for support. What happens to tariffs? Utilities are doddering in the absence of timely tariff revision. There are two things in this. One is what I found in a state like Rajasthan when I visited it, I suspect that the enthusiasm I see from Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, I am hopeful that these states really move fast and have come into the 24X7 category. But what I did see in Rajasthan, the state utilities increased the loss by over Rs 50,000 crore in last five years. So, it's a government which is completely agnostic to running projects efficiently and allows indiscriminate power thefts, don't bother about proper distribution network, meters are getting spoilt and are never replaced. Their revenue was only Rs 10,000 crore against an expenditure of Rs 23,000 crore last year. There's no concern for what amount is generated, or purchased, what is built, what is collected. We will have to set these things right only after consultation with the states. Centrally, I cannot interfere in states, it's a concurrent subject and in the federal polity, states are very sensitive to any 'diktats'. I will be using a lot of persuasion to reach out to different states. For me it's not about politics, I want to reach out to all states uniformly. We want 24X7 power for every citizen of India as Modi says elections are over and electioneering is over. Now it's time to perform for 125 crore citizens. We are going to reach out to the states and help them tide over these problems and incentivise good performance by states. I must tell you Gujarat, which has turned from a Rs 2,500 crore loss-making utility into a Rs 500 crore profit making utility under Modi over the last 10-12 years and giving 24X7 power to everybody, has had the lowest increase in tariffs compared to any other state in the country. I don't think it's only about tariff. They have separated their agricultural feeder, they have metered every home, and they have filed FIR's and prosecuted (people) power thefts, their collection efficiencies are among the finest. They are able to ensure that people get the power when they want at their homes, industries, commercial gets 24X7 power; agriculture gets adequate power as per their needs. It's a case study worth doing. That's what when I first visited Gujarat, I said let me learn what needs to be learnt so set other things right. It was a very educative experience. I felt very good being at Sabarmati ashram , I saw the river front and what work the govt has done there and it inspired me both , to look at it as an opportunity to give back to the society, to give back to the nation and also to see how things can be done. I mean if Mahatama Gandhi can get his freedom by spinning a charkha or Modi could clean up the water front which otherwise could have been such a sensitive subject in a communally-charged city like Ahmedabad, in a densely populated area, I think lot of things can be done, it needs little bit of leadership, sincerity of purpose and transparency and honesty. If I tell you transparently what my issues are like when the Delhi crisis came , I shared with the people what exactly my situation is and after that I found everybody cooperating very well. Are the stranded generation capacity the proverbial monkey for the government? There won't be blackouts if this capacity is brought on stream. These are actually an opportunity for the government because come to think of it, I know I have the ability to produce. I need to sort out a) its fuel supply b) transmission and finally c) distribution. Now I am very clear where exactly are the issues lying. A lot of public sector and private sector project have either come up or are on the verge of getting commissioned. They need some last-mile funding for which we've already had a meeting with the bankers and we have a small group of people , bankers and experts, who are working to see what will be the best way to provide that last mile funding but more critical issue is how to expand the output from the coal mines, how to ensure more coal goes to the power producers. The previous government had all sorts of permutations and combinations that these people will get so much coal, those will get so much; these will not be eligible, these will have to import. It's quite a complicated web we've created. My logic is simple, If a plant has come up, it is now a national asset, to waste that, keep it idle, is a national liability, national cost. Whether the banks have funded it or whosoever and if you see what all perspective, someday that cost for being stranded will be burdened on the consumers after all we are in an ecosystem wherein interest is loaded into the cost of project as interest during construction and someday it goes in the tariff calculation directly or indirectly. So my approach is that my job is to quickly get all of them operational. Get coal production to ramp up and start supplying to every operational asset and get them into production. May be, I will not be able to do 90% as I want to do right away but I will start and keep ramping it up as my production increases. So I don't think that the stranded projects are impossible to retrieve, I think I only have to increase their fuel supply on one hand and on the other I am already in dialogue with states to quickly expand the transmission so I can evacuate power all over the country and of course the last mile distribution. What about the gas-based projects? It's a much smaller dimension than the coal-based projects or thermal opportunity but in gas based also, it's a matter of approach everyone is crying about it and I am looking at it as an opportunity in the gas plants. May be, in the very long run there is a problem because gas is keeping on getting expensive and this will become pretty much unviable. But if you see from a different perspective, country has a peak load problem and gas plants can be switched on and off within 15 minutes. So they can act like a spinning reserve so I can actually use these gas plants to provide the peak loads whenever there is peaking demand, once the distribution and transmission set up is up and about. So I am hoping that a quick decision is taken by the courts where some of these gas issues are pending and we are able to see visibility in terms of the expanded gas supplies and then we will see what to do with these gas plants. Will you ask for some financial relief for the stranded projects as an interim measure? My effort is to see if I can do all of this within the framework of existing RBI guideline because I don't think it will be fair on the part, or for any one sector in the country to change established rules of the game, or law of the land for a particular set of problems we have. Having said that, it may require some small dispensations which will not completely erode the RBI's efforts to bring in more strength to the banking sector. I had a meeting with the bankers and it was a very good experience, I found them all to be very cooperative in our efforts. I think they realize that we are making very sincere efforts. I have appealed to them that they also put one foot forward also and I have assured that I will put two feet forward for every one foot that they extend. I think if all us, stakeholders, govt, banks, generating companies, distribution companies, public at large, if all of us work together, and instead of sensationalizing every issue we give the whole process a certain amount of time to stabilize and set things right, I think the problem is not impossible and the problem is not daunting. It is doable. Are you planning to open coal mining to private sector? It's not about private or public, I want to bring efficiency and better management practices in to the system, I would like to do the same things in Coal India Ltd as I would like the private sector to do if and when they do get into this sector. As regards opening up , that is up to the Cabinet to take a decision. It also depends on the Supreme Court, on the issue of mines which are under litigation because till that time I am not able to auction or open up a lot of mining. But I certainly see a lot of competition as being good for the nation, I certainly believe if more competition comes in, coal reserves can be mined faster, new technologies can be introduced. Coal India will stand to benefit from competition in terms of its own improved efficiencies, benchmarking will be better for Coal India. I had a meeting with Coal India officials -- people have always kind of held that company to be having a lot of problems -- my effort is that to take shortest possible time to bring in high standards of probity and improve their efficiency, so even a Coal India employee can hold his head high when he goes and tell somebody that he works for Coal India. Is there any proposal to restructure Coal India? There has been a lot of talk about recasting/restructuring and what not of Coal India. I have examined the reports in this regard and they have flagged it as one possible option. In that respect, our government has its mind open on all options always. Like today I mentioned I am trying to rationalise the coal linkages. If I were to do that with seven separate entities, it would be almost impossible. But with Coal India in a structure of one company, its far easier for me to rationalize this without any loss, inter say, so there are certain advantages. Obviously there are disadvantages in terms of valuation because holding companies don't get the same value as individual operating entities. So one never knows what will happen in the future but as of now I think you need to focus less on form more on substance. What about disinvestment in Coal India? That's for the Hon'ble finance minister and others to take care of. I have no problem in that either way. There's no disinvestment as such. We are just asking more of the public to hold or own the fruits of Coal India because after all, it's a public company. The PM has been talking about the solar revolution. What are your plans for way forward? Solar is a great thing, again something which helps the peak load, which comes in peak hours. Storage is getting cheaper with the new technologies so we could at some stage look at dovetailing solar with high storage capacities and that could become an excellent off-grid solution for remote villages and remote areas. Leh-Ladakh has some far off places where it may be difficult to move transmission lines but a solar-cum-off grid solution could be a great idea. Similarly, looking at the huge potential of solar in India and the fact that it is renewable energy without any environmental degradation as long it happens on barren land, waste land and doesn't affect the agricultural or irrigated land parcels, I think it is a great idea and we will expand on it significantly. But money has been a problem... Money, off late, has been a bit of a problem for everybody. We shall find a solution. There is the other issue of imports vs domestic production. Are you seeking a reconsideration of dumping duty on solar panel imports from certain countries? I have sought reconsideration from both commerce and the revenue ministries. Logic being that, this is based on data of 2012, or thereabouts. At that point of time, the solar mission was a very small mission. India has a capacity of producing 600-700 mw and we are doing 400 mw or so. For that point of time, it made decent sense that the 400 mw gets sold or sourced indigenously. Now we are looking at expanding the solar mission manifold. And Indian manufacturing doesn't have the capacity. If you put these kind of tariffs and barriers, we won't be able to generate solar power to the extend we want to at competitive prices. Worldwide, prices have fallen so much that now solar can stand on its own feet. The tariff has come down to Rs 6.50-7. The critical aspect is that we certainly want to improve indigenous production. And we want to expand our capabilities and capacity in India to produce.</text>
